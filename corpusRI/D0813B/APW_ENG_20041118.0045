Recount triggered in down-to-the-wire Washington governor's race
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The closest governor's race in Washington history was forced into a
recount as counties finished tallying the ballots and found only a
few votes separating the candidates out of 2.8 million cast.
</P>
<P>
Republican Dino Rossi held a mere 261-vote lead over Democratic
Attorney General Christine Gregoire after all counties reported their
final tallies to the state. A recount is required by state law when
there is less than a 2,000-vote margin.
</P>
<P>
"After this election, I'm going to have 'Every vote counts' tattooed
on my forehead," Gregoire spokesman Morton Brilliant said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday was the deadline for counting the ballots.
</P>
<P>
The recount means Washington voters will have to wait until next
Wednesday to find out who their next governor is _ a stunning
scenario considering the experts never thought it would be this
close. Gregoire was considered the favorite.
</P>
<P>
"We really aren't going to know before we do this recount who the
governor is going to be," said Secretary of State Sam Reed, a
Republican who will oversee the recount process. "I feel sorry for
Attorney General Gregoire and Senator Rossi."
</P>
<P>
Washington is one of two states (the other is Alaska) that allow
voters to mail ballots on Election Day, so votes have trickled in at
an agonizingly slow pace.
</P>
<P>
As political junkies across the country have recovered from their
presidential election withdrawal, they have turned to the Washington
governor's race for entertainment. Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat who is
stepping down after two terms, said he has "never seen anything like
this before."
</P>
<P>
"It's fun, it's exciting, it's like a two-week playoff series. But
it's a lot more important than a ballgame," said Joe Arko, a Texas
doctor who has been following the Washington election religiously on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The election is reminiscent of the 2000 U.S. Senate race in
Washington that took several weeks of counting and recounting before
Democrat Maria Cantwell was declared the winner over Republican
incumbent Slade Gorton.
</P>
<P>
Washington is a Democrat-leaning state that has not elected a
Republican governor since 1980. John Kerry won the state with 53
percent of the vote, Locke easily defeated Republican opponents in
the past two elections, and Democrats control the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
So why is this election so close?
</P>
<P>
Gregoire was the Democrats' Wonder Woman. Polished and popular, the
57-year-old attorney general won national recognition as lead
negotiator of the national tobacco settlement in the late 1990s. But
her campaign struggled to find a message that resonated with voters.
</P>
<P>
Rossi, meanwhile, surprised everyone with a slick, strong campaign
that painted him as a compassionate conservative. The 45-year-old
Rossi, a wealthy real estate agent, lacked name recognition outside
his district, but his promise of a fresh start in state government
caught on with voters.
</P>
<P>
"Gregoire ran a front-runner, media-based race, where she did not
take controversial positions, and focused her resources on the media
rather than the grass roots, and that's very dangerous," said
political scientist Ken Hoover, a professor at Western Washington
University. "Rossi had a somewhat sharper message."
</P>
<P>
Washington elections are usually clean to the point of dullness. But
the twists and turns in the vote-counting have sparked conspiracy
theories and court battles.
</P>
<P>
"We have arrived at the moment which all reasonable Washingtonians
have dreaded for four years: the moment when the Court is asked to
micromanage an election," Judge Dean Lum wrote in a decision ordering
that certain provisional ballots be counted.

GOP Sues to Overturn Washington Election

Alleging that dead people, felons and other ineligible
voters cast ballots in Washington state's tortuously close election
for governor, the Republican candidate filed a lawsuit Friday, seeking
the extraordinary remedy of a new election.
</P>
<P>
Christine O. Gregoire, the Democratic attorney general, last week
was declared the winner by just 129 votes of the nearly 2.9 million
cast.
</P>
<P>
The candidate on the losing end of that certification, ex-State
Sen. Dino Rossi, said he would petition a court for an unprecedented
statewide revote, which he called the only way to fix the ``certified
mess'' of the one conducted Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
``Most Washingtonians don't believe this has been a valid
election,'' Rossi said at a news conference, where he was joined by
former U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton in the call for a new vote. ``They want
a revote to make sure our state has a legitimate governor,'' Rossi
said.
</P>
<P>
In the initial count of the results and a mandatory recount, both
conducted with machine readers, Rossi was declared the winner, in the
latter case by 42 votes. That margin, 0.0015 percent, made the race
one of the closest statewide contests in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
But Gregoire, taking advantage of a state election law provision
for a statewide hand recount of all the ballots, prevailed in the
third round, as roughly 2,000 ballots that were not read by the
machines helped give her herrazor-thin margin of victory. The
Republican secretary of state, Sam Reed, certified her election Dec.
30, but it did not bring legal maneuvering to a close.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, some Republican poll watchers have emerged to say
they saw so-called ``provisional'' voters being allowed to cast their
ballots directly into the election machines, rather than into special
envelopes that should have gone to county election boards for
certification that the voters were indeed eligible.
</P>
<P>
And The Seattle Times and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, in
stories Friday, found at least 25 instances of people who had died
before their absentee ballots were mailed, being listed as voting in
the election.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire said Friday that the election and the recounts had been
conducted in a ``consummate professional way,'' and that she saw no
evidence of the sort of massive fraud or malfeasance that would be
necessary to undo her victory.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Rossi's lawsuit, which was filed in conservative-friendly
Chelan County, in a rural part of the state, Gregoire said: ``I
respect the rights of others to file an action in court. That's their
right. I have to respect that, I'm the attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
The bizarre race has taken so many twists and turns that nobody
quite seems to know how it will wind up.
</P>
<P>
Some political experts here said it was striking how the two sides
had reversed their roles -- when Rossi was ahead, Republicans called
on Democrats to accept the results and ``move on.'' Gregoire and her
supporters, planning for an inauguration ceremony in Olympia that
Republicans may boycott, are essentially doing the same thing now to
the Rossi camp.
</P>
<P>
Lance T. LeLoup, a political science professor at Washington State
University, said that Gregoire seemed to hold the upper hand both
legally and politically, and that the Republican idea of a revote
could set a dangerous precedent.
</P>
<P>
``They're doing more to undermine public confidence in the election
system than the election did itself,'' LeLoup said of the Republicans
and their lawsuit. ``No matter what they say now, the fact is it is
coming across as totally contrary to what the Republicans said about
Bush in 2000 and what they said when Rossi was ahead in the count.
There's an element of sore-loserism to it.''
</P>
<P>
The thicket of issues raised in the lawsuit could take weeks to
untangle, but on the other hand it might lead a judge in Chelan County
to issue an injunction blocking the inauguration, which is what some
Republicans seem to be hoping for. If that happens, it is simply not
clear how quickly the case could be moved along to the state Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
Nor is it clear, if an injunction were in effect, just who would
serve as the state's governor.
</P>
<P>
But for now, Gregoire remains scheduled to take the oath of office,
and she insists she will do so.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle newspapers found some explanations for the dead voters,
while others remained a mystery. One man, who could now be subject to
prosecution, confessed to the Post-Intelligencer that he had followed
his dying wife's wishes on how she would have wanted her ballot cast,
even though she died Sept. 29, well before the election. She voted --
or rather he voted, twice -- for Rossi.

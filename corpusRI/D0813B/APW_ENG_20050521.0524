Washington election challenge puts politics on trial

<P>
In a nondescript courtroom in this small farming town, America's electoral
system is about to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
The battle over Washington's contested governor's election touches on many of
the questions that divide this country between rural and urban, Republican and
Democrat, red and blue _ and echoes frustrations of the past two presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Republican Dino Rossi is challenging Democratic Governor Christine Gregoire's
victory in the closest statewide election in national history, alleging
widespread problems including illegal votes cast by felons and dead
people.
</P>
<P>
The challenge goes to trial Monday, months after Gregoire was sworn in. Rossi
won the first count and a machine recount, but the Democratic stronghold of
Seattle pushed Gregoire to a 129-vote win in a final, hand recount of 2.9
million ballots.
</P>
<P>
In rural Washington, the complaint is pretty simple: They're tired of Seattle
choosing their political leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Seattle is the tail that wags the dog in the state," complained Republican King
County Councilman Steve Hammond, whose working-class, suburban district is a 20
minute drive from downtown Seattle. "There is a disenfranchised feeling out
there."
</P>
<P>
Add to those regional tensions the continuous parade of errors from the King
County elections division _ officials acknowledged finding 94 uncounted ballots
in boxes as recently as last month _ and you get a Republican brew of suspicion
and resentment that resembles how Democrats felt after President George W. Bush
won the 2000 and 2004 elections.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire, a three-term state attorney general, was the anointed successor to
popular two-term Democrat Gary Locke. But she struggled against Rossi _ a
moderate Republican, former state senator and self-made real estate millionaire
who charmed voters with a savvy campaign.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire won only eight of Washington's 39 counties when all the votes were
counted, recounted by machine, and recounted again by hand. She was losing until
Seattle counted its last votes _ the same thing that happened in 2000 when
Senator Maria Cantwell defeated Republican Slade Gorton.
</P>
<P>
In the trial, Republicans are alleging widespread problems in the election,
including illegal votes cast by felons and dead people, and provisional ballots
that were illegally tallied without being properly checked.
</P>
<P>
Rossi wants a new election, although most Washington residents do not. A March
poll of 800 voters by a Republican consulting firm found that while 56 percent
believed Rossi was the true winner, only 39 percent wanted a new
election.
</P>
<P>
Rossi acknowledges that many people want to move on. But he can't.
</P>
<P>
"I told my kids, sometimes the right thing to do isn't the easy thing to do. The
easy thing to do would be to turn a blind eye to it," said Rossi. "It's really
basic, and having a system you can have faith in is really the foundation of our
democracy."
</P>
<P>
Gregoire, meanwhile, believes the trial will simply dredge up old
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to see more rhetoric, more accusations," Gregoire said. "I'm a
person that lives by the law, and the law in the state of Washington says I'm
governor."
</P>
<P>
Whoever loses will appeal to the state Supreme Court, which will make the final
decision.
</P>
<P>
Rossi hopes the Supreme Court will hear the case in June and nullify the
election, creating a vacancy in the governor's office that will be temporarily
filled by Lieutenant Gov. Brad Owen. Then candidates will file in July, compete
in a primary in September, and voters will chose a new governor in
November.
</P>
<P>
That's an ambitious timetable, and perhaps an exhausting proposition for voters
who just survived a messy election season.

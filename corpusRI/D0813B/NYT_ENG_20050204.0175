JUDGE SAYS THAT HE, NOT LEGISLATURE, WILL RULE ON DISPUTED ELECTION

<P>
In a defeat for Democrats as they defend Gov.
Christine O. Gregoire from a Republican lawsuit that challenges her
election, a judge said on Friday that his courtroom, not
the Democratic-controlled Legislature, was the proper forum to investigate the
contest.
</P>
<P>
The ruling thrilled Republicans who have been pushing to remove Gregoire
since December, when she was declared the winner by 129
votes out of nearly 3 million cast.
</P>
<P>
The race, unusual in its tiny margin of victory and the
bitterness it has prompted, featured three official counts, only the
last of which went in Gregoire's favor. Persistent Republican accusations
of serious flaws in the ballot counting and recounting led
to the suit.
</P>
<P>
The suit, seeking a revote, has been under way in Chelan
County, east of Seattle, since Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with this ruling," said Mary Lane, a
spokeswoman for the Republican candidate, Dino Rossi, who has become
something of a governor in exile among his supporters. "This
election contest can move forward, which is very good news."
</P>
<P>
At the packed hearing before Judge John E. Bridges of Chelan
County Superior Court, whom a Democratic governor appointed in 1988,
a cryptic sentence from the state constitution kept being repeated,
first by Democratic lawyers who argued that it meant that
the Legislature should decide the case, and then by Republican
lawyers, who argued that it meant that the courts should
decide, and finally the judge as he ruled.
</P>
<P>
The sentence, which is 116 years old, says contested races for
governor "shall be decided by the Legislature in such a
manner as shall be determined by law." Until Friday, its
meaning had never been parsed by a state court, Bridges
said.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by the thick white binders filled with briefing materials from
the two parties and complaining wryly of a lack of
sleep from all the reading, Bridges ruled that the Legislature
had, through a longstanding state law, already delegated the authority
to hear election contests to the state's courts. Thus, "by
law," he ruled, the Legislature had given him the authority
to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
Republicans had originally named more than 80 defendants in the case,
including officials in all 39 Washington counties. Later in the
day, Bridges ruled in favor of the Democrats and several
of the counties on motions to dismiss all county officials
from the suit, saying the number of defendants was unwieldy
and unnecessary. That took the number of defendants down to
three, chief among them Secretary of State Sam Reed, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said they were not surprised by the rulings and were
happy that the Republicans would be required to prove their
case within the confines of the election law, a process
that could take some time and be much like putting
the election on trial.
</P>
<P>
"This is going about the way we expected," a lawyer for
the Democrats, David McDonald, said. "If you've got to decide
this case under the election contest statute, these guys are
in trouble."

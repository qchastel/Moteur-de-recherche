Gregoire Soldiers on As Election Dispute Simmers

<P>
It hasn't been much of a political honeymoon for Gov.
Christine Gregoire.
</P>
<P>
In a normal political atmosphere, she would have been guaranteed
time to convince voters that the 9.5 cent-a-gallon gasoline tax
increase she pushed through the legislature a few days ago was the
right thing to do. Before being asked to cast their ballots again,
voters might have seen the fruits of her plan to ease the Puget Sound
region's mind-boggling transportation problems.
</P>
<P>
But this isn't a normal political world.
</P>
<P>
Since Washington state voters went to the polls in November,
Gregoire routinely has awakened to headlines about mishandled ballots,
deceased voters and what the alternative Seattle Weekly recently
called ``the election that won't die.''
</P>
<P>
Her erstwhile challenger, Republican Dino Rossi, is suing to get
the election overturned. Many legal experts say that when his case
goes to trial May 23, the Republicans certainly have a shot at getting
an unprecedented revote. The number of ballots that have come under
question far exceeds Gregoire's 129-vote margin of victory. If their
race were a 100-yard dash, the distance between them at the finish
line was barely one-third of an inch.
</P>
<P>
The post-election fight has become what state Republican chairman
Chris Vance calls ``the legal equivalent of Gettysburg.'' Both parties
have spent millions of dollars on legal challenges and, in fact, U.S.
Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, last year's Democratic
presidential nominee, is scheduled to fly here Sunday to help raise
money for Gregoire's cause.Through it all, however, even the
governor's detractors say she has remained remarkably focused.
</P>
<P>
In the just-ended legislative session, Gregoire managed to achieve
most of her stated goals -- including passage of her $8.5-billion
transportation plan. She has made nearly all of her major personnel
appointments, and says she is confident of prevailing in the legal
battle ahead.
</P>
<P>
``I cannot and, in fact, I refuse to get distracted by what is
going on (in the legal case),'' Gregoire, 58, said in an interview in
Tacoma. ``My philosophy is, the only thing I can do is to be a good
governor.''
</P>
<P>
Gregoire was sworn in in January, just days after state elections
officials certified her victory after a hand recount of all 2.9
million ballots. Before that, two machine recounts had given Rossi a
42-vote lead.
</P>
<P>
If a revote happens, said Gregoire, a former state attorney
general, ``I'll deal with it. But frankly, I can't see getting
there.''
</P>
<P>
Plenty of election-law experts here agree with her. Washington
courts have never ordered a statewide revote, they say, and Gregoire
appears to have followed the recount provisions to a T.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls also suggest that Gregoire has prevailed in the court
of public opinion: A majority of Washingtonians now oppose a revote,
which Rossi says is the only fair way to settle the matter.
</P>
<P>
One dynamic in any future Gregoire-Rossi matchup, however, will
have changed profoundly: Gregoire now has a record to run on.
</P>
<P>
While Democrats say the governor has accomplished much in a short
time, Republicans call her a thief, or ``Gov. Fraudoire,'' and say she
has resorted to big-spending, tax-hiking Democratic ways.
</P>
<P>
``For good or for bad, she'll be running as an incumbent,'' said
Stuart Elway, a Seattle-based pollster. ``Rossi's campaign will be:
`See, I told you nothing would change if she became governor, and
nothing did. They just raised taxes again.' He'll run the same
campaign, only this time with an exclamation mark.''
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Rossi, a former state senator, called the
election ``a giant mess.''
</P>
<P>
``At this point,'' said Mary Lane ``not even Christine Gregoire can
continue to say with a straight face that . . . anyone can know with
certainty who won.''
</P>
<P>
It is also impossible to know, Elway said, whether in a revote the
electorate would focus on the gas, tobacco and state estate tax
increases passed under Gregoire or give the Democrat-controlled
legislature credit for tackling big problems.
</P>
<P>
Those include reconstruction of Seattle's Alaskan Way Viaduct,
which was damaged in a 2000 earthquake, and replacement of the busy
Highway 520 bridge over Lake Washington that connects Seattle with its
eastern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
``Transportation is on top of the charts of issues that people want
resolved,'' Elway said. ``So if the sense coming out of this session
is: `We're finally doing something about it,' it could be a huge plus
for her.
</P>
<P>
''But these projects have such a long lead time,`` Elway said,
''and in the meantime people are not going to be happy about these new
taxes.``
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Gregoire plans to travel around the state in the coming days for a
series of public bill signings -- where she will tout the passage of
legislation that expanded health coverage for nearly 20,000 poor
children, increased enrollment and tuition aid at public universities
and created a $1-billion fund for biomedical and agricultural
research.
</P>
<P>
As a public speaker, political-watchers here said, Gregoire can
come off as somewhat wooden and controlled, although she routinely is
described as funny and warm in more personal settings.
</P>
<P>
''My frustration is, did people get to know me (during the November
election),`` the governor said. ''I don't think they did.``
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In the November election, Gregoire targeted issues in her
television ads without talking much about her life: She is the
daughter of a single mother who said she fled an abusive relationship
and raised her child while working as a short-order cook. The governor
herself is the mother of two accomplished daughters, the wife of a
Vietnam War veteran, a breast-cancer survivor and a three-term
attorney general who helped lead the landmark tobacco-litigation that
brought tens of billions of dollars to the states.
</P>
<P>
Rossi, in contrast, ran an ad campaign that featured his children
and described how he'd worked as a young man polishing floors at the
Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
Since being sworn in, Gregoire said, she has received support from
around the country.
</P>
<P>
''All I get is, `We are so proud of you, you are courageous, you
are strong,'`` she said, describing the letters and e-mails. ''People
somehow or another have seen what happened here as kind of the model
(for the way disputed elections should be resolved).``
</P>
<P>
But former U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash. -- who was ousted in
2000 by Democrat Maria Cantwell in another bitterly close race --
recently blasted King County officials for having what he called ''the
worst elections administration of any county in the United States of
America.``
</P>
<P>
Ballots from King County, where Seattle is located, gave Gregoire
her edge in the final recount. They have been the focus of charges
that dead people, felons, ineligible provisional voters and others who
should have been struck from the polls all got to vote.
</P>
<P>
Democrats have a different view, saying that problem ballots occur
in virtually every statewide election and that the real news is how
well the vast majority of ballots were counted. State Democratic Party
chairman Paul Berendt called the 2004 vote ''the most accurate
election in state history.``
</P>
<P>
During a recent call-in television program, Gregoire told one state
resident: ''I really wish we could move on.``
</P>
<P>
Being governor, she said, is a 24/7 job, and ''I'm doing what I
would've done if I had won by a landslide.``

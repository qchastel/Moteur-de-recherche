QUESTIONS LINGER AS GOVERNOR TAKES OVER IN WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
OLYMPIA, Wash.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The swearing-in ceremony here that made the Democrat
Christine A. Gregoire the new governor of Washington on Wednesday
after one of the closest elections in history had all
the somber ritualistic touches, complete with prayers and bagpipes wailing
"God Bless America."
</P>
<P>
But outside, on the airwaves, on billboards and in statements made
by Republicans, Gregoire's hold on the office was questioned even
as she gave her inauguration speech. Republicans and their candidate,
Dino Rossi, have sued to overturn the election, which Gregoire
won by 129 votes after two recounts.
</P>
<P>
The court case, filed in a Republican-leaning county, will most likely
be settled only when this state's Supreme Court weighs in.
Republicans say the election was flawed because of irregularities in
the biggest and most Democratic county, while Gregoire supporters say
the problems were not unusual for a large turnout, and
did not change the outcome.
</P>
<P>
But Washington's state constitution has no specific provision on a revote,
leaving leaders of both parties struggling over the high ground
of public esteem as the politics of the state enters
a legal frontier.
</P>
<P>
For Republicans, that means building a base of discontented voters using
their allies in conservative talk radio and the building industry.
As Gregoire was giving her speech, the Building Industry Association
of Washington ran radio advertisements saying, "We don't even know
who our legitimate governor is."
</P>
<P>
They were backed by conservative radio hosts, who helped to organize
a rally of about 2,500 opponents to Gregoire here on
Tuesday. They called on legislators to delay the swearing-in while
the court heard the legal challenge. The motion was defeated
along party lines.
</P>
<P>
For Democrats, the new campaign means trying to build a base
of majority popular support for Gregoire, should a new vote
occur.
</P>
<P>
In her inaugural speech, Gregoire, the former state attorney general, struck
a conciliatory tone, reaching out to Rossi and calling for
election reform.
</P>
<P>
She announced a task force, chaired by Secretary of State Sam
Reed, a Republican, to review the state's election process.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, before a packed house in the Capitol rotunda,
Gregoire recalled her blue-collar background, thanked her mother -- a
"short order cook" -- and her parish priest, who gave
a prayer. She talked about her survival from breast cancer,
and praised her husband, a Vietnam veteran.
</P>
<P>
"Many have asked how I can govern without a clear mandate
from voters," she said. "I believe the voters have given
us a mandate -- a mandate to overcome our differences
and to solve problems."
</P>
<P>
After the speech, Republican leaders tried to walk a line between
acknowledging Gregoire as governor and saying it was not quite
over.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is we will never know who really won this
election," said Rep. Bruce Chandler, in giving the Republican response.
"That's very disconcerting."
</P>
<P>
Republicans said their party base is angry, and not willing to
give up.
</P>
<P>
At the Tuesday rally, Republicans chanted "Re-vote! Re-vote!," while Democrats, in
a much smaller rally, held signs that read, "Don't waste
our tax $ on your hurt feelings."
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Republican minority in the Senate, Bill Finkbeiner,
seemed to take a small step toward reconciliation. "She's now
the governor of Washington state and we're ready to work
with her," he said. "In the meantime, this is going
to be sorted out."
</P>
<P>
What happens next is uncertain. Democrats said the court could throw
out the results, but any remedy would be in the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
A Democratic leader in the House, Rep. Helen Sommers, also said
it would be uncharted territory for a court to order
a new election. Among the questions are whether there would
be a primary, or whether third-party candidates could run. A
Libertarian candidate received more than 60,000 votes in the race,
more than enough to tip the balance.
</P>
<P>
"If the court were to set aside the result, I assume
they would direct the Legislature to find a remedy," said
Sommers. "But I don't even think a court could set
it aside."
</P>
<P>
Republicans have not detailed any plans on how a new election
would take place. They circulated an online petition, and with
their allies in industry, have backed an electronic billboard message
for a re-vote, which flashes along Interstate 5.
</P>
<P>
Rossi led after the initial count of the votes and in
the first recount, performed by machine, and lost in the
second performed manually.
</P>
<P>
At nightfall, both sides appeared ready to put differences aside for
the inaugural ball, even as they said it could be
the only semblance of a honeymoon for Gregoire.

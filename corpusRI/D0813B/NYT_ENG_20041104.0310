WASHINGTON STATE GOVERNOR'S RACE IS STILL SQUEAKING

<P>
Florida is settled this time around and the country knows who is
president, but Washington state residents are still wondering: Who is
the new governor?
</P>
<P>
"Neck-and-Neck," a phrase that was punctuated with an exclamation
point Thursday on the Web site of the Republican candidate, one-time
underdog Dino Rossi, is almost an understatement at this point.
</P>
<P>
The latest vote tallies in a gubernatorial cliffhanger, whose outcome
will be determined by hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots yet
to be counted, show Rossi and his Democratic opponent, state Attorney
General Christine Gregoire, within a hair of each other. On Thursday
evening, Gregoire had 49.45 percent of the vote and Rossi had 48.45
percent.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Rossi, 45, a businessman who has a dog named
"Dubya" and may be only the latest benefactor of the national
Republican renaissance, was ahead by about 800 votes. By Wednesday
evening, though, Gregoire, 57, who was favored to win until the final
days of the campaign, was ahead by about 14,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday night, Gregoire had widened her lead to 21,234 votes. But
there were still 682,645 votes left to count, and the possibility of
a recount loomed in a state that has not sent a Republican to its
governor's mansion in Olympia since 1980.
</P>
<P>
"I have a headache," said Paul Berendt, chairman of the Washington
State Democratic Party. "I never had a tension headache leading up to
the election, but I've got one now."
</P>
<P>
Gary Locke, the current governor, who decided not to run for
re-election last year and threw his support behind Gregoire, said in
a telephone interview, "Everybody is on pins and needles."
</P>
<P>
Still, Locke and Berendt said Thursday that they were optimistic, as
were officials with the Gregoire campaign, the state's Republican
Party chairman and Rossi campaign officials, all of them describing
complicated formulas pointing to a win for each side.
</P>
<P>
The counting of absentee ballots is expected to continue at least
through Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
"It's too close to call, but I'd rather be us than them," said Chris
Vance, the state Republican Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
Vance added, "When you've got a really good Republican with a lot of
money and a really good Democratic with a lot of money, that's what
you get: dead even."

REPUBLICAN WON'T APPEAL DECISION IN WASH. GOVERNOR'S RACE

<P>
A judge in this conservative area of Eastern
Washington on Monday rejected claims by Republicans that fraud and
illegal votes wrongly put a Democrat, Christine O. Gregoire, in
the governor's office, and in response the Republican candidate, Dino
Rossi, said he would end his five-month legal effort to
remove her.
</P>
<P>
Rossi's decision came as a surprise because his lawyers had long
said they expected to the case to be appealed to
the state's Supreme Court if they lost. A spokeswoman for
Rossi attributed his decision to the forcefulness of the ruling,
issued by Judge John E. Bridges of Chelan Country Superior
Court.
</P>
<P>
An appeal "just wasn't going to be possible, and it was
time to end it," said the spokeswoman, Mary Lane.
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Bridges said lawyers for Rossi had failed to
meet their burden of proof, providing no "clear and convincing"
evidence that illegal votes were responsible for Gregoire's 129-vote victory
over Rossi last year. It was the closest race in
the state's history.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence in this record that Ms. Gregoire received
any illegal votes," Bridges said in a ruling that had
been eagerly awaited by each side. Bridges noted that the
only illegal votes that had been proved during the trial
were five cast by convicted felons; four were for Rossi,
and one was for a Libertarian candidate, Ruth Bennett.
</P>
<P>
Although Bridges cited widespread errors in the election, particularly in King
County, the state's most populous and liberal county, he said
it was plain that those human errors did not amount
to fraud. "There is no evidence that the significant errors
that occurred resulted from intentional misconduct or someone's desire to
manipulate the election," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling left Democrats euphoric.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire said in a statement that it was "great news."
</P>
<P>
After Rossi announced that he was dropping the case, her spokeswoman,
Althea Cawley-Murphree, said, "She's very pleased that this is finally
something that the whole state can put behind us."
</P>
<P>
Other Democrats painted Rossi as a sore loser who had wasted
taxpayer time and money on a frivolous lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
"The Republicans never had a case," said Paul Berendt, the chairman
of the state Democratic Party. "There was no fraud, there
were no serious irregularities."
</P>
<P>
Berendt argued that the lawsuit was more about trying to burnish
Rossi's image at the expense of Gregoire. "They have shown
that they will say anything, they will spend anything and
they will do anything to tear down Christine, and that
needs to stop," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dale Foreman, a lawyer for the Republicans, rejected that accusation. "We
filed an election contest because we felt the election was
unfair," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the election, the more than 2.8 million ballots cast were
counted three times. The first two tallies gave Rossi a
victory by very small margins that shrank from one count
to the next, and the final count, conducted by hand,
put Gregoire in office.
</P>
<P>
Republicans claimed in court to have identified 754 votes cast by
felons, but they could not prove that even one had
cast an illegal ballot for Gregoire, largely, Foreman said, because
they did not interview the felons about which way they
voted.
</P>
<P>
Democrats did interview some of the felons, providing depositions from five
of them, including the four who said they voted for
Rossi.

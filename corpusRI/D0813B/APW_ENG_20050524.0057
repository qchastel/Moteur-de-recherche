Republicans allege fraud in Washington state governor's race as trial seeking to overturn results opens

WENATCHEE, Washington

<TEXT>
<P>
A trial to determine whether the results of Washington state's gubernatorial
election last fall should be thrown out opened with Republicans charging
Democrats "stole" the contest for Christine Gregoire, who won by 129 votes out
of 2.9 million cast.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans want Dino Rossi declared the winner or a do-over election
held.
</P>
<P>
"This is a case of election fraud," Republican attorney Dale Foreman said in his
opening statement in the trial, which is being heard by a Superior Court judge
without a jury. "This election was stolen from the legal voters of this state by
a bizarre combination of illegal voters and bungling bureaucrats."
</P>
<P>
Democratic attorney Kevin Hamilton argued Republicans lack the "serious proof"
they need to make their case and justify the removal of the governor. He also
said the Republicans' belated claim of fraud demonstrates "desperation" on their
part.
</P>
<P>
"Imperfection is not enough to overturn an election," Hamilton said. "It's not
enough to throw a lot of dust in the air and make allegations."
</P>
<P>
Foreman surprised the court with a new claim: that the Democrats rigged the
election by stuffing ballot boxes in Gregoire's two strongest precincts and by
"losing" votes in two of Rossi's strongest precincts.
</P>
<P>
The findings in Seattle's heavily Democratic King County show "partisan bias and
not random error," Foreman said. "If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a
duck, it's probably a duck."
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the Republicans have largely complained of bungling rather than
outright fraud on the part of election officials.
</P>
<P>
Chelan County Superior Court Judge John Bridges ruled that Republican lawyers
could present evidence about possible fraudulent actions during the nine-day
trial, though he said the court "does not believe there is a fraud causation
element to this case."
</P>
<P>
Rossi, a former state senator and commercial real estate agent, won the first
count last year by 261 votes and a machine recount by 42 votes. But during a
hand recount of 2.9 million ballots, the Democratic stronghold of Seattle made
Gregoire, a former attorney general, the winner by 129 votes.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire was inaugurated in January amid protests from Rossi
supporters.
</P>
<P>
Neither Gregoire nor Rossi planned to attend the trial.

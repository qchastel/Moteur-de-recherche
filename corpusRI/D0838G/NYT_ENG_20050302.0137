FOR DRIVERS, A TRAFFIC JAM OF DISTRACTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Trujillo is beginning to sound like an outlaw. He has
turned against a law he was instrumental in passing.
</P>
<P>
As vice chairman of the Public Safety Committee for Santa Fe,
N.M., Trujillo supported and promoted the city's adoption three years
ago of a ban on the use of all but
hands-free cell phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
"I was seeing people run into things, and it was happening
because they were on their cell phones," said Trujillo, who
owns a valet parking service.
</P>
<P>
He left the committee in December, but his feelings about the
law changed long before that.
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning I pushed it pretty hard," he said. "But
then I realized, 'God, how stupid is this law?"'
</P>
<P>
Leaving the hands free had the potential to increase, not decrease,
driver distraction, he said. "If you have hands free, not
only are you able to do something else, but you
are able to do three different tasks at the same
time." He now thinks the law should be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
Since New York passed the nation's first statewide law banning hand-held
cell phones while driving four years ago, New Jersey and
Washington, D.C., have followed with laws that went into effect
last summer. Some cities, like Santa Fe, have passed similar
legislation, and more than a dozen states have partial bans
or bills pending.
</P>
<P>
The laws have often been ignored, and enforcement has been spotty
at best. Some drivers are not even aware they are
breaking the law. A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration survey,
released Tuesday, showed that more people than ever are phoning
while driving, and only a small percentage are using headsets.
</P>
<P>
"People are ignoring it," said Steve Carrellas, New Jersey coordinator for
the National Motorists Association, speaking of that state's law. "It's
just like the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. Despite what people say
in polls, what the vast majority of people are actually
doing is not complying with it."
</P>
<P>
But cell phones, hands-free or hand-held, are just a part of
the greater problem of driver distraction, one that may become
worse with the spread of technology.
</P>
<P>
No one doubts that using a cell phone can cause lapses
in attention. Anyone who has groped for a phone bleating
at the bottom of a purse or dialed while at
the steering wheel knows this. The question, at one time,
was whether that was any worse than, say, unwrapping a
cheeseburger or lighting a cigarette. Now it's also a question
of whether a cell phone is more of a hazard
than playing a DVD, using the calendar or e-mail functions
on a wireless hand-held device, or picking out a playlist
on an iPod.
</P>
<P>
A few states have laws related to watching movies and television
while driving, or placing a TV in front of the
driver. But what if the cell phone screen doubles as
a TV? Of if the phone can take pictures? Or
the organizer can send instant messages? Or the dashboard has
an ever-present electronic map?
</P>
<P>
This, in part, is what inspired Trujillo to take a stand.
"There isn't a law that will be able to catch
up," he said. "If you ban cell phones, then someone
else will come up with something else."
</P>
<P>
Matt Sundeen, a policy analyst at the National Conference of State
Legislatures who focuses on transportation, agreed. "Driver distraction has been
an issue since the car has been around," he said.
"But now you have all these different technologies where legislators
can't possibly write legislation for specific technologies. It's impossible to
keep pace."
</P>
<P>
The result, Sundeen said, is a trend toward legislation that is
worded more broadly to address the new behaviors. The Washington,
D.C., law, for example, not only requires that mobile phones
be equipped with a hands-free accessory but also prohibits reading,
writing and "using personal communications technologies."
</P>
<P>
Sundeen said it was hard to gauge whether any of the
laws had helped to reduce the number of traffic accidents.
"It is difficult to determine what role, if any, a
cell phone plays in most car accidents," he said. "Even
if you can correlate the exact moment of the crash
with phone records, you don't know if it's the cause
or not."
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Strayer, a professor of psychology at the University of
Utah who studies driver distraction, said laws like those in
New York and New Jersey were well intentioned and "not
an unreasonable first attempt to solve the problem." But, he
said, "they make an error in assuming that it can
be remedied by a hands-free cell phone."
</P>
<P>
He added: "The laws could very plausibly be counterproductive if they
give people the message that a hand-held phone is unsafe
but a hands-free phone is safe. You're encouraging people to
engage in a type of activity that is no more
safe than the old way of talking on a cell
phone."
</P>
<P>
Even before the New York law went into effect, studies indicated
that it was the distraction of the conversation itself, not
the act of dialing or holding the phone, that accounted
for most of the increased risk.
</P>
<P>
"There is really good evidence from six independent studies from five
different labs that have all come to the same conclusions,"
Strayer said. "There is no difference between hand-held and hands-free
cell phone use while driving."
</P>
<P>
He continued: "The main source of the interference is mental, cognitive.
It turns out you're tuning out some important details about
driving. When using a cell phone, peoples' eyes will go
to a place or thing, but they won't see it.
It won't register."
</P>
<P>
Hall Smyth, an exhibition designer who lives in Pond Eddy, N.Y.,
and has an office in Queens, two hours away by
car, said he had experienced the opposite phenomenon. "If I
need to attend to the driving, I fade out of
the conversation," he said. "But I can see you'd easily
do it the other way."
</P>
<P>
Smyth no longer uses a hand-held phone while driving, however, after
an encounter with a New York City police officer.
</P>
<P>
For months after the state's hands-free requirement went into effect in
2001, Smyth simply ignored it, chatting away practically nonstop during
his long drives into New York City. Then he was
pulled over one day in Manhattan. "I was just driving
down Seventh Avenue and a police van pulled me over,"
he said. "I couldn't believe they actually enforced it."
</P>
<P>
Were it not for the $95 ticket, he said, it is
very likely that he would still be driving with the
phone virtually cemented to his ear.
</P>
<P>
Other drivers don't willfully disobey the law; they just aren't aware
of it.
</P>
<P>
The ban in New Jersey has not been a problem for
Mireya Ortiz. She didn't know it existed. "Are you serious?"
Ortiz said after maneuvering her car into a parking space
in Jersey City, mascara wand in hand. "In New York
I knew about it, but not here."
</P>
<P>
Ortiz, a social worker who lives in North Bergen, N.J., has
spent years using her car as an ersatz phone booth.
Her three teenagers call her cell phone often, and when
she isn't taking calls from her children, she is talking
to friends in New York and Miami.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz said she found out about the New York ban only
after a friend was stopped there for driving without a
headset. Yet Ortiz has no plans to buy a headset,
even for improved safety. "I just can't stand them," she
said.
</P>
<P>
If she gets pulled over, she plans to employ the same
tactics that her friend did. "Oh, she just flirted out
of it, you know," Ortiz said. "She didn't get the
ticket."
</P>
<P>
Hands-free setups are far from ideal. Tommy O'Dea, an electrical contractor
in Manhattan, has a cradle glued to his car's console,
a microphone on the visor and a speaker mounted under
the dashboard.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people complain that I sound very far away,"
he said. "And if I have the window rolled down
and I'm on the highway, I find myself shouting."
</P>
<P>
Katie McCormick Lelyveld has come up with a creative way to
conform to at least the spirit of the ban in
Washington, D.C. While she doesn't often use her headset with
her BlackBerry phone, she doesn't hold it up to her
ear, either. Instead, she uses the speakerphone and drives her
Lexus SUV with her phone in her lap or in
the car door. "It's not worth getting caught," she said.
</P>
<P>
McCormick Lelyveld's car does not have a navigation system or a
DVD player, but she does run her iPod through her
radio, necessitating the occasional adjustment of the click wheel.
</P>
<P>
Her speakerphone has become something of a style statement. "I kind
of like the idea of having people think I'm talking
to myself," she said.
</P>
<P>
Reading and responding to e-mail messages while driving, an act that
requires multiple finger taps and focusing on a small screen,
can be a major distraction. Although McCormick Lelyveld no longer
subscribes to the e-mail service on the BlackBerry, she confessed
that when she did, she read a message or two
in the car.
</P>
<P>
But Christine Nesbit, a lawyer in Eugene, Ore., where there is
no law related to cell phone use, would never do
such a thing. Nesbit owns a BlackBerry that receives e-mail
messages, but she turns off the alert when she is
driving.
</P>
<P>
Her self-discipline came as a result of having worked as a
prosecutor for the Eugene Municipal Court, where she frequently handled
traffic cases. "What you learn is that if you are
doing anything that impairs your perception and your ability to
do this incredibly multifaceted job of driving safely, it's dangerous."
</P>
<P>
Trujillo cannot claim to be so virtuous. His Treo cell phone
is fully enabled with the e-mail feature. Does he ever
check e-mail in the car? "I couldn't lie to you,"
he said. "Yes. But I only do it at stop
signs and stoplights."

IN U.S., POLITICIANS FIND IT HARD TO KEEP MOTORISTS OFF THE
PHONE
</P>
<P>

<P>
When it comes to prohibiting cell phone use in cars, the
United States lags far behind other parts of the world.
Using a hand-held phone while driving is banned in some
45 countries, including Australia, Germany, France, Britain and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, state and municipal laws vary widely. Among
states, only New York and New Jersey have full bans,
as does the District of Columbia. Some other states have
partial bans.
</P>
<P>
In Maine, for instance, drivers with a learner's permit may not
use a hand-held cell phone, and in Arkansas, Massachusetts and
a handful of other states, school bus drivers are prohibited
from using phones except in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
In Delaware, although there is no law specifically related to cell
phones, a driver can be prosecuted for "inattentive driving," which
can include using a mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
A list of state laws, pending legislation and laws in other
countries is at cellular-news.com/car(USCORE)bans/.
</P>
<P>
Even in countries where the laws are strictly enforced, compliance isn't
what it could be.
</P>
<P>
"The police here are strict but you still see quite a
few people with phone held up to their ear," said
Bill Howard, who lives in Bittern, a town near Melbourne,
Australia. Howard said his 22-year-old daughter was once pulled over
while holding her phone in her hand but not talking
on it.
</P>
<P>
Within the last five years every state has considered some type
of bill restricting cell phone use by motorists, but the
bills seldom pass, said Matt Sundeen, a policy analyst at
the National Conference of State Legislatures. Connecticut, Georgia and Nebraska
have had multiple bills introduced that were defeated.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike something like drunk driving, there's no national consensus on this,"
Sundeen said. "So there's less pressure on states to act."
</P>
<P>
Several states have passed legislation preventing local governments from enacting or
enforcing their own bans. In Florida, for example, a number
of towns and Miami-Dade County had laws in place that
were pre-empted by the Legislature.

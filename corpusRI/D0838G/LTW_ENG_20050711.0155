Study Shows Headsets Aren't Safer for Drivers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study of cellphone use by motorists suggests that they aren't any
better off using a headset in the car than holding the phone to their
ear: They're still four times as likely to end up in a crash and
injured as drivers who stay off the phone altogether.
</P>
<P>
The survey, released Monday by the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety, said using mobile phones while driving was just as dangerous
whether they're chatting through a headset or holding on to the
handset.
</P>
<P>
The statistical analysis, which compared phone records with the
times of accidents, indicated that the risk was just as great across
all age groups and in both sexes.
</P>
<P>
It's not just keying in phone numbers or calling up messages but
the conversation itself that can be the most distracting, said Anne T.
McCartt, the insurance institute's research executive overseeing the
study.
</P>
<P>
``There's the possibility that some technology in the future would
eliminate distractions from using the phone in the car, but it's hard
to think of any way to eliminate the distraction from the
conversation,'' she said. ``Your brain can only perform so many tasks
at once.''
</P>
<P>
The American Insurance Association, a Washington, D.C., trade group
for insurers, hailed the survey as a major advance in the emerging
body of research on cellphone use by motorists.
</P>
<P>
``This study reinforces the fact that cellphone use is a major
distraction and increases injury and death,'' said Julie Rochman, an
executive with the group.
</P>
<P>
The research, to be published Tuesday in the British Medical
Journal, drew on the experiences of about 500 drivers in Perth,
Australia, who were treated in hospital emergency rooms after crashes
from April 2002 to July 2004.
</P>
<P>
Using phone records, McCartt and researchers at the University of
Sydney estimated the increased risk of injury by comparing the
drivers' cellphone use as much as 10 minutes before their crashes
occurred and at control intervals as much as a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
The institute had to go to Australia to conduct the survey because
U.S. carriers would not permit a look at phone records to verify a
driver's distraction at the time of a crash and to allow appropriate
comparison periods.
</P>
<P>
McCartt said the city, with 1.3 million residents, was comparable
to many U.S. cities. Western Australia also bans the use of cellphones
while driving unless hands-free devices are used. Still, about a third
of the crash victims interviewed, she said, had been holding phones to
their ears.
</P>
<P>
The results could bolster the wireless industry's arguments against
hands-free laws, or it could have the opposite effect of leading to
bans on cellphone use altogether while driving.
</P>
<P>
``Based on our study, that would make some sense,'' McCartt said.
``But it would be very hard to enforce a law like that.''
</P>
<P>
The institute, a nonprofit research group funded by U.S. insurers,
has not taken a position on any legislation.
</P>
<P>
A hands-free law, however, could at least help encourage drivers
holding their cellphones to their ears to put them down, preventing
some accidents, she said.
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of mobile phones -- the number of subscribers in
the United States passed the number of land lines last fall -- has had
profound effects on society. The prospect that air travelers may soon
be able to call while flying, for instance, has many people upset.
</P>
<P>
Cellphone customers spend more time talking on their phones while
in their cars than anywhere else. Last year, they spent 40 percent of
their time on mobile phones while driving, compared with 24 percent
while in the home, according to an April survey of consumer habits by
the Yankee Group, a research firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
The California Legislature is considering a law that would require
motorists to use hands-free devices -- either headsets or new wireless
technology that turns radios into temporary phones. A similar bill
died in the Senate last fall. And a bill to ban various driving
distractions -- including smoking, eating and all cellphone use --
died in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
``Clutching a cellphone to your ear means that in that split second
in an emergency when you need both hands on the wheel, you won't have
it. And that could be the difference between life and death,'' said
Democratic state Sen. Joe Simitian, the measure's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and the District of Columbia have
banned the use of hand-held cellphones while driving, mandating that
motorists use headsets or other hands-free devices instead. So have
Chicago and cities in five other states.
</P>
<P>
In New York, which passed the first such law in 2001, the insurance
institute noted a 50 percent drop in motorists' use of cellphones,
spokesman Russ Rader said. But over time, usage rose to nearly where
it was before as drivers ignored the $100 fine.
</P>
<P>
Federal bills in 2001 and 2003 didn't make it out of committees.
</P>
<P>
Mobile phone carriers and the wireless industry, through the
Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, have opposed any
laws singling out mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
``Legislation is really the easy way out, but it's ineffectual,''
said John Walls, the trade group's chief spokesman. ``What we firmly
believe in is that you empower people by educating them, making them
aware of the right way to behave. But looking at one distraction is
not right.''
</P>
<P>
Walls said any law would fail to deal with all driver distractions,
such as passengers talking in the back seat or drivers eating or
drinking. Cellphone use, he said, is ``no more or less distracting
than any other distractions.''
</P>
<P>
Insurers tend to agree but for different reasons. Their trade group
doesn't want traffic laws passed that aren't going to be enforced,
Rochman said.
</P>
<P>
But a distraction that is four times as dangerous as when it isn't
there is a major problem, McCartt said. A passenger, for instance, can
see what the driver sees and even warn of trouble ahead, but someone
on the other end of a phone call has no idea what traffic is like, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
``Lots of things are distracting,'' she said. ``The key for
researchers is to look in terms of the bottom line -- serious crashes.
That's what this study adds.''

DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION (FOR USE  BOSTON GLOBE

BICYCLISTS SAY THESE motorists are indistinguishable from drunk drivers. Truckers honk
when they stray from their lanes. Regular drivers watch for
their last-minute swerves down a side street or onto an
exit ramp.
</P>
<P>
They - it will come as no surprise - are drivers
using cellphones.
</P>
<P>
Everyone has personal stories of accidents or near misses, but studies
are now coming in that make it clear: Cellphone use
by drivers in motion is a menace, and a growing
one.
</P>

Motorists using cellphones are four times as likely to be in
an accident as those who aren't, according to a study
last year in Australia. A Harvard study estimates that 6
percent of US accidents, and 2,600 deaths a year, are
linked to cellphones. Even so, the number of drivers using
a cellphone at any given time rose from 5 to
6 percent nationally between 2004 and 2005, according to a
report last month from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Among drivers 16 to 24 years old, frighteningly, it was
up to 10 percent.

It is time for Massachusetts to put a stop to the
practice. It is not a matter of personal freedom when
distracted drivers endanger others' lives and limbs, or even when
they bang a few thousand fenders, driving up everyone's insurance
premiums.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Connecticut and the city of Chicago joined New York
state, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C., in banning the use
of hand-held phones by motorists. Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, and Tennessee
barred their use by young drivers. But the United States
is only catching up with global trends. Some 40 countries,
including most of Europe, restrict cellphone use by drivers.
</P>
<P>
A bill has been filed in Massachusetts that would outlaw only
the use of hand-held phones, and another that would apply
only to young drivers. But it has been shown that
hands-free phones are just as hazardous. And mature drivers who
are not paying attention can be as dangerous as young
ones.
</P>
<P>
Representative James Marzilli, an Arlington Democrat who is pushing for an
outright ban of all devices, says he fears that the
lack of restrictions has given drivers a sense that the
use of cellphones "is a birthright - like cars themselves."
But that must change.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Americans are making multitasking a way of life. But when
one of those tasks is piloting a ton of steel,
or more, at 100 feet per second, public safety requires
a focus on that task alone.
</P>
<P>
Cellphones are great for emergencies; a driver can pull over and
dial 911. But their use should be banned for motorists
while in motion. They have proven to be a dangerous
distraction. Far too often, 911 is being called because someone
was on a cellphone.

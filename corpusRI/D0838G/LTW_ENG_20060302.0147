Many Still Ignore D.C. Cell Phone Law

It's the law that nearly everyone supports -- and
nearly everyone ignores. In the year and a half since Washington D.C.
began restricting drivers' cell phone use, police say they have issued
thousands of tickets to violators. But for every driver silenced with
a $100 fine, many others are still out there talking on hand-held
phones, casually disregarding the law.
</P>
<P>
``Everybody does it,'' said Ann Edwards, a retiree who lives on
Capitol Hill, ``and I think it's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
The lack of compliance is common talk in the city. On radio talk
shows, callers often complain about drivers weaving down streets with
cell phones stuck to their ears. Many say they spot police officers
violating the law. On his monthly call-in show, D.C. Police Chief
Charles Ramsey is often challenged about his commitment to enforcing
it. He said officers ticket people all the time.
</P>
<P>
``The numbers bear that out -- if they see it, they write it,''
Ramsey said in a recent interview. ``Sometimes an officer uses
discretion. I don't know if they're going to stop for a cell phone
when they're going to a robbery in progress. Sometimes things get
busy.''
</P>
<P>
And Ramsey urged people to report any officers they see breaking
the law.
</P>
<P>
Last year, D.C. police officers issued 6,018 tickets for driving
with a hand-held cell phone, said Lt. Byron Hope of the Traffic Safety
and Special Enforcement Branch. This January, 370 tickets were issued,
he said. Police began enforcing the law in August 2004.
</P>
<P>
Reaction to D.C.'s law -- one of the first in the country -- shows
how ambivalent the public is about having anything, even safety,
interfere with the beloved cell phone. And it underscores how
completely, and in such a short time, the device has come to dominate
people's lives. Cell phone users in the United States have increased
from 34 million a decade ago to more than 203 million, according to
CTIA -- the Wireless Association, and the debate about the
technological phenomenon has only begun.
</P>
<P>
At least 25 state legislatures are considering restrictions on cell
phone use while driving, many aimed at young drivers. But an argument
is growing that laws requiring hands-free devices might contribute to
hazards by encouraging drivers to talk longer. The emphasis on cell
phones also discounts other activities that take people's eyes and
minds off the road.
</P>
<P>
``The real issue is driving while distracted,'' Ramsey said. ``The
cell phone has just been the poster child.''
</P>
<P>
The automobile group AAA agrees, urging drivers to use cell phones
only in emergencies and saying the rush to enact new laws is
``probably sending the wrong message,'' said spokesman Mantill
Williams.
</P>
<P>
``It's almost like a useless law to a certain extent,'' Williams
said. ``It sounds good, and politicians love it because it makes it
sound like they're doing something. But hands free is not risk free.
It's not a safety device; it's just a convenience device.''
</P>
<P>
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Washington D.C. have the most
restrictive laws, according to the National Conference of State
Legislatures. Last year, Maryland legislators prohibited drivers
younger than 18 from using any cell phone. This year, a Virginia bill
that would prohibit 16- and 17-years-olds from talking on the phone
while driving passed the state Senate but was killed in a House
subcommittee. The Senate killed a bill this session to require
hands-free phones for all drivers.
</P>
<P>
Police have no data on whether the D.C. law has reduced the number
of accidents. And Russ Rader, spokesman for the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety, said he is not aware of any studies looking at the
city law's effect on safety.
</P>
<P>
Anecdotal evidence is also sketchy. Tow truck operators said they
have seen no difference in accidents. Several local insurance offices
said the issue rarely comes up. ``The only reason it would end up in a
report is if the insured indicates the crash was due to the cell
phone, and we very rarely include it in our reports,'' said Olya
Mikhailova of Georgetown Insurance Group.
</P>
<P>
But there is plenty of evidence that cell phone use is a major
distraction. A recent study by the insurance institute said drivers
who use any cell phones were four times more likely to get into
crashes serious enough to cause injury. In another recent study, the
Virginia Tech Transportation Institute found that fatigue was the most
frequent cause of accidents. Taking eyes off the road was second -- and
the longer the eyes were away, the more likely a crash.
</P>
<P>
``Obviously, if you're dialing a cell phone, you're going to take
your eyes off the road longer than if you're popping a CD in,'' said
Sherry Box, spokeswoman for the Transportation Institute.
</P>
<P>
Linda Garcia, director of the communications, culture and
technology program at Georgetown University, said the cell phone lends
itself to ``multitasking,'' often the goal of area workaholics, but at
a price.
</P>
<P>
``I think we give up a certain amount of autonomy to the machines
we use -- they govern us rather than vice versa,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Garcia compares the public attitude about the D.C. law to the
initial reaction to seat-belt laws -- first came resistance and a
minimum of enforcement, then crash data and public awareness campaigns
gradually prompted the public to buckle up.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Anthony A. Williams, D, says the police department ``is doing
a very good job of striking a balance between zealous enforcement and
educating drivers.'' Ramsey said local drivers are starting to comply
more, in part because ear devices have become ``cool, almost a status
thing.''
</P>
<P>
Studies by the insurance institute showed that hand-held phone use
in Washington decreased from 6.1 percent of drivers to 3.5 percent
right after the new law went into effect, Rader said. A recent
follow-up survey showed the reduction has held steady, he said. But in
New York, he said, similar studies showed that hand-held use returned
to old levels after an initial drop.

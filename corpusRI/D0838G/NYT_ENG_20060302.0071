AIR FORCE BASES PUT BRAKES ON DRIVERS USING CELL PHONES

<P>
If you drive on Lackland Air Force Base,
it's time to turn off your cell phone -- or
risk being grounded.
</P>
<P>
Lackland is the first Air Force base in Texas' Bexar County
to enforce a ban on use of cell phones while
driving, a rule that's becoming common on military bases under
a Pentagon directive.
</P>
<P>
The base began stopping cars and giving verbal warnings Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
After a 60-day grace period, military personnel, government employees and civilian
visitors could be banned from driving on Lackland for up
to a year if they're cited for violating the rule
four times over the course of 12 months. The same
penalty would apply if they are caught six times in
two years, said Master Sgt. Aaron Thieken.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we are pulling people over," often to find they
aren't aware of the rule, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike a cell phone ban initiated in October at Fort Sam
Houston, an Army post, the new rule at Lackland permits
the use of hands-free cell phone devices with a single
earpiece.
</P>
<P>
Randolph Air Force Base also is studying a cell phone restriction.
Brooks City-Base, on city-owned land, is not considering one, a
base spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department approved restrictions on cell phone use for motorists
last year, leaving the military services and individual bases to
decide when and how to enforce the rules. The restrictions
followed a study by the National
</P>
<P>
Highway Traffic Safety Administration that found cell phone use was a
growing cause of accidents.
</P>
<P>
At Fort Sam Houston, 56 citations have been given over the
past four months, post spokesman Phil Reidinger said. Though the
post commander could ban a repeat violator from driving there,
no one has yet lost driving privileges.
</P>
<P>
Supervisors and commanders are notified when government or military personnel are
cited.
</P>
<P>
Reidinger said the rule has generally been well-received -- even though
it bars motorists from using cell phones altogether while driving.
</P>
<P>
Hands-free devices don't fully prevent accidents, because they allow motorists to
have a conversation when they should focus on driving, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is pull over" to talk on
a cell phone, he added. "That's what I do."

AUSTIN, Texas
</DATELINE>

<P>
Erin Leas was grounded, but her mom let her
out anyway.
</P>
<P>
She'd been well-behaved and really wanted to see her boyfriend. It
was a beautiful outside, and the 16-year-old high school cheerleader
called on the way home to say, "I had the
best day of my life."
</P>
<P>
She never made it home.
</P>
<P>
Making one more call to her boyfriend that October day in
2001, Erin lost control of her car and hit a
cedar tree.
</P>
<P>
"She was gone," said her father, Patrick Leas.
</P>
<P>
He testified Monday to the House State Affairs Committee of the
Texas Legislature in favor of several bills that would restrict
the use of cell phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
"You may not think this is the most important bill, but
look into the eyes of Erin's sister, her mother and
her brother, and tell them it's not important," he said.
</P>
<P>
The proposals to curb cell phone use include three sponsored by
Rep. Jose Menendez (D).
</P>
<P>
-- House Bill 237 would make it a misdemeanor for drivers
to use their cell phones unless they're using a hands-free
device, the vehicle is stopped or it's an emergency.
</P>
<P>
-- House Bill 236 would restrict cell-phone use while driving in
a school zone.
</P>
<P>
-- House Bill 1094 would make it an offense for minors
to use cell phones while driving for the first six
months after getting a license.
</P>
<P>
A proposal by Rep. Helen Giddings (D) would make it illegal
for school bus drivers to use a phone while operating
the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The bills were left pending in committee and likely will be
taken up later this month. The Senate is to hear
similar legislation in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We're asking folks to pay attention to what they're doing, to
keep both hands on the wheel and eliminate some of
the distractions," said Menendez, who unsuccessfully pushed similar legislation in
2003.
</P>
<P>
According to the most recent data from the Texas Department of
Public Safety, cell phone-related accidents jumped from 716 in 2000
to 1,032 in
</P>
<P>
2001 -- a 44 percent increase. Another report by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates 3 percent of drivers are
talking on hand-held phones at any given time of the
day.
</P>
<P>
A partial or full ban on cell phone use by drivers
exists in New York, New Jersey and the District of
Columbia and is being considered by 16 other states.
</P>
<P>
Cell phone industry representatives say drivers also are distracted by changing
CDs, smoking or eating.

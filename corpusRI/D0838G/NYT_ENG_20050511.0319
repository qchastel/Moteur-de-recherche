ILLINOIS: CHICAGO REGULATES CELL PHONE USE
</P>
<P>
Chicago City Council approved an ordinance making it illegal to use
a hand-held cell phone while driving. Starting in July, drivers
could be fined $50 or up to $200 for a
violation tied to a car accident. The law does not
apply to drivers who are using a hands-free phone or
are calling emergency numbers. New York, New Jersey and Washington,
D.C., have similar bans.

Louis Graham, the DeKalb County police chief, announced the formation of
a five-member cold-case squad whose first task will be to
reinvestigate five of the Atlanta child killings that terrified the
city from 1979 to 1981. Investigators said they would also
look into the disappearance of a sixth victim who was
found in Fulton County. Graham reopened the case to try
to determine whether Wayne Williams, a 23-year-old music promoter who
was sentenced to life for two of the killings, was
responsible for at least 22 others. Most of the victims
were black boys.

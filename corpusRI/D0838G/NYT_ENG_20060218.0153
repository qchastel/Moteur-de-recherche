BABY ON BOARD, AND CABBY ON CELL PHONE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new mother -- OK, she's my daughter,
but that is not the point of this tale --
watched disbelievingly the other day as a New York cabby
drove away with her baby boy. How's that for a
parent's nightmare?
</P>
<P>
Here's what happened:
</P>
<P>
Mom hailed the taxi, with 4-month-old Max in his stroller, one
of those models with an upper part that lifts up
and doubles as a car seat. Mom, first name Maggie,
went through her usual taxi routine of buckling Max in,
car seat and all, and putting the frame of the
stroller in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
On reaching her destination, she paid the driver. Then she got
out to retrieve the stroller frame. As a precaution, to
signal that she wasn't finished, she left her door open.
The cabby popped the trunk. She took out the frame.
So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
That's when the driver took off with (1) his rear right
door open, and, more important, (2) the baby still in
the back seat.
</P>
<P>
Maggie, yelling "Hey!" gave chase. She caught up with the cab
after half a block. The driver stopped. He said "I'm
sorry" when informed that Max was in the car, but
did not seem especially contrite. And that was that. Mom,
her heart pounding, went on her way with the baby.
</P>
<P>
Oh, did I mention that the driver was yakking away on
his cell phone?
</P>
<P>
His mind was everywhere except where it was supposed to be:
on his work.
</P>
<P>
A shocking story? Perhaps. But New Yorkers who take taxis even
semiregularly will not be surprised. They are all too familiar
with drivers who hurtle through the streets while talking into
the microphone of a hidden cellphone, usually in a language
incomprehensible to the passenger. Indeed, the passenger may as well
not exist.
</P>
<P>
This is not an exercise in cabby-bashing. Drivers work hard. Despite
the moaning about them that you hear from some New
Yorkers, they usually know their way around, at least in
Manhattan, and they sometimes endure more abuse than they deserve.
(Remember when the Giuliani administration, ever graceful, called them "taxi
terrorists" for daring to protest city policies they considered unfair?)
</P>
<P>
But there is a good reason cabbies are forbidden to talk
on cell phones, even with hands-free devices, while they are
in motion. They can become so distracted that they miss
a turn or fail to stop. When one of them
drives away with a door open and a baby in
the back, you know there is a problem.
</P>
<P>
Even the drivers' union, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, does
not defend such behavior. It may complain that fines imposed
by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission are too high.
But "of course, from a safety angle, we're not for
cell phone use while driving," said William Lindauer, a member
of the alliance's organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Matthew W. Daus, the taxi commissioner, calls the cell phone problem
"a challenging enforcement issue" because it is not easy for
an inspector standing on the street to tell if a
driver is on a hands-free phone. Daus' sense is that
the situation has improved of late. The number of cell
phone-related summonses issued in 2005 was well below the 2004
total, a fact that he attributed to better compliance, not
laxer enforcement.
</P>
<P>
"But we don't have our heads in the sand," he said.
"We know it's still happening out there."
</P>
<P>
That it is.
</P>
<P>
On one level, it is hard not to sympathize with the
drivers. Theirs is a lonely job. With this technology they
can ease their isolation. But at what cost? And might
they not be a bit less lonely if they just
tried talking to their passengers, who always have the right
to say they would rather ride in silence?
</P>
<P>
Both parties, drivers as well as passengers, "often feel like the
other one's not treating them as a person," said Bruce
Schaller, a transportation consultant specializing in the taxi industry. From
the cabby's perspective, chatting up the passenger could be a
good thing, leading to a bigger tip, he said. But
it could also be risky.
</P>
<P>
"You can get into an argument, or offend somebody," Schaller said.
"There are language issues. It tends to encourage being pretty
passive."
</P>
<P>
Fair enough. That being the case, I had a suggestion for
Max's mom. Next time, make paying the driver the last
thing you do. He may forget an open door. He
may forget the baby. But forget the cash? Not a
chance.

The European Union (EU) sent a 
clear warning to Turkey on Thursday over the trial of a well-known
novelist, saying it would affect the Muslim country's EU accession
process.
</P>
<P>
Orhan Pamuk, who has won a number of international awards in 
literature, will go on trial in Istanbul on Friday for "insulting"
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from his remarks in an interview with a Swiss 
newspaper in which he said "30,000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians 
were killed in Turkey" during World War I and in the 1980s and 
1990s. He also claimed that almost no one dares to speak out about
this.

<P>
"The trial of a novelist who expressed a non-violent opinion 
casts a shadow over the accession negotiations between Turkey and 
the EU," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
Rehn said Turkey should make serious efforts in bringing its 
legislation in line with EU laws, including the European 
Convention of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"Full implementation of the (judicial) reforms will be the 
crucial foundation to facilitate progress in the accession 
negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not Orhan Pamuk who will stand trial tomorrow, but 
Turkey," the commissioner said. "This is a litmus test to see 
whether Turkey is seriously committed to the freedom of expression
and reforms that enhance the rule of law and benefit all Turkish 
citizens."
</P>
<P>
Pamuk is charged under Article 301 of Turkey's recently revised
penal code, which carries a jail term of between six months and 
three years for a person who "explicitly insults" the Turkish 
republic.
</P>
<P>
Rehn said the new penal code "does not provide sufficient 
protection for the freedom of expression" and the Turkish 
government should "close the loopholes in the code."
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament said Wednesday it is sending observers 
to attend the trial of Pamuk to see whether Turkey's 
implementation of its new penal code is in conflict with the EU 
human rights laws.

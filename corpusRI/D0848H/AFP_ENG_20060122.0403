An Istanbul court has dropped 
charges against prominent author Orhan Pamuk, who was accused of 
"denigrating the Turkish national identity" over remarks he made 
about the mass killings of Armenians during World War I, CNN-Turk 
television reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The trial of Pamuk, Turkey's most famous writer, which began 
last month, had been adjourned pending a decision by the justice 
ministry, whose authorization was needed to continue the case.
</P>
<P>
CNN-Turk said the ministry had declared in a letter to the 
tribunal that it was legally not competent to judge whether the case 
should go on, and the court had thus decided to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
When contacted by AFP, a justice minitry official declined any 
immediate comment on news of the court's decision but said the 
ministry would address the issue on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk, who has won several international literary prizes, risked 
up to three years in prison for remarks made during an interview 
published in a Swiss magazine last February.
</P>
<P>
"One million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in these 
lands and nobody but me dares talk about it," he told Das Magazin in 
February.
</P>
<P>
Turkey categorically denies Armenian accusations that up to 1.5 
million of their kinsmen died in a genocide orchestrated by the 
Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1917.
</P>
<P>
The case against Pamuk, praised by Turkish nationalists, drew 
condemnations from the European Union, which warned it was a test of 
freedom of speech in Turkey. Some EU lawmakers who attended the 
December hearing said the trial could affect the country's 
aspirations to join the bloc.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk's lawyer could not be reached to confirm the television 
report.
</P>
<P>
The trial had been set to resume on February 7.

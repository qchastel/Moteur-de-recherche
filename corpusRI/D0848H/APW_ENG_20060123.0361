The European Union welcomed a Turkish court decision Monday to drop charges
against well-known novelist Orhan Pamuk, but warned Ankara that it must address
legal loopholes that limit freedom of speech in other cases.
</P>
<P>
Olli Rehn, the EU commissioner in charge of expansion, said the decision to drop
the case against Pamuk was "good news for freedom of expression in Turkey," but
said Turkey "needs to fill properly the loopholes" in its penal
code.
</P>
<P>
"Pamuk is not the only case of a person prosecuted for having expressed a
non-violent opinion in Turkey, it's just the most high-profile case," Rehn
said.
</P>
<P>
"Several journalists, editors, writers and academics still face similar charges
today. I hope therefore that the decision on Orhan Pamuk's case will pave the
way for a positive outcome for them as well, so that freedom of expression for
all Turkish citizens is fully respected."
</P>
<P>
The Pamuk case became the focus of critics against the 25-nation bloc opening
entry talks with Turkey last October.
</P>
<P>
In its progress report on Turkey last year, the European Commission also called
on Ankara to ensure its penal code reforms were implemented to ensure democratic
freedoms were protected in its court system.
</P>
<P>
Rehn said the current judicial laws "leave too much room for abusive and
restrictive interpretations limiting freedom of expression."
</P>
<P>
Pamuk went on trial for telling a Swiss newspaper in February that Turkey is
unwilling to deal with two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish
history: the massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was
not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey's overwhelmingly
Kurdish southeast.

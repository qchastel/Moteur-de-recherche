EU enlargement chief Olli Rehn 
hailed Monday a Turkish decision to drop charges against prominent 
author Orhan Pamuk, but pressed Ankara over similar cases and urged 
the country to review its law.
</P>
<P>
"This is obviously good news for Mr Pamuk, but it's also good 
news for freedom of expression in Turkey," Rehn said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk had been charged with insulting the Turkish nation in 
remarks on the mass killings of Armenians during World War One.
</P>
<P>
The case has attracted huge international attention and cast a 
pall on Turkey's commitment to free speech at a time when the EU is 
closely monitoring the membership candidate's adherence to 
democratic values.
</P>
<P>
Rehn said he hoped the developments in Pamuk's case would help 
ease the plight of other writers and intellectuals being persecuted 
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Several journalists, editors, writers and academics still face 
similar charges today," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope therefore that the decision on Orhan Pamuk's case will 
pave the way for a positive outcome for them as well, so that 
freedom of expression for all Turkish citizens is fully respected."
</P>
<P>
And he warned: "It is clear for me that Turkey needs to fill 
properly the loopholes of the current Penal Code, which leave too 
much room for abusive and restrictive interpretations limiting 
freedom of expression."
</P>
<P>
Pamuk, 53, risked six months to three years in jail for 
"denigrating the Turkish national identity" in remarks published in 
a Swiss magazine concerning the Armenian massacres of 1915-17.
</P>
<P>
"One million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in these 
lands and nobody but me dares talk about it," Pamuk told Das Magazin 
in February.
</P>
<P>
Turkey categorically denies Armenian accusations that up to 1.5 
million of their kinsmen died in a genocide orchestrated by the 
Ottoman Empire in the last years of its existence.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk, Turkey's best-selling writer, is the author of 
internationally renowned works such as "My Name is Red" and "Snow" 
and winner of a number of literary awards.

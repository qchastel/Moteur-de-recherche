TURKISH COURT DROPS CHARGES AGAINST NOVELIST

ISTANBUL, Turkey

<TEXT>
<P>
An Istanbul court dropped charges against the novelist
Orhan Pamuk on Monday, ending a trial that put Turkey
at odds with the European Union over the issue of
freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk, whose works have been translated into dozens of languages, spoke
in a newspaper interview about the mass killings of Armenians
by the Ottoman Empire in 1915, and also of the
deaths of Kurds in Turkish operations in the 1980s against
a separatist group. He was then prosecuted for "insulting Turkish
identity."
</P>
<P>
The subject of the 1915 massacres remains taboo in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The court had asked the government to rule on whether to
proceed with the case. On Sunday, the Justice Ministry told
the court to make the decision, citing changes made to
the penal code last year. On Monday the court dropped
the charges.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was immediately welcomed by the European legislators. However the
lawyer for the novelist, Haluk Inanici, chided the court for
framing its decision in bureaucratic terms rather than addressing the
issue of freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
"The court dropped the charges not because the trial violated the
freedom of speech," he said, but because "there was a
missing approval by the Justice Ministry to proceed with the
trial."
</P>
<P>
Pamuk was facing a sentence of up to three years in
jail if he was convicted of insulting the Turkish identity
in the interview he gave to Das Magazine, a Swiss
publication, in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk's high profile abroad, in Europe and elsewhere, prompted widespread opposition
to his prosecution, an advantage that many intellectuals who face
similar charges do not have, said Vecdi Sayar, general secretary
of International PEN, a worldwide association of writers.
</P>
<P>
PEN says that about 70 intellectuals have been charged under Article
301 of the revised penal code, which calls for punishment
for public comments that "denigrate Turkishness, the government, the army
and the memory of the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk."
</P>
<P>
"There are many people abroad who fail to see beyond Orhan
Pamuk's trial," Sayar said. "Saving a writer like Orhan Pamuk
from prosecution may stand as a symbolic example on its
own. But it is not an overall resolution for other
intellectuals and writers that still face similar charges in Turkey."

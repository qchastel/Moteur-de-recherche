British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw urged Tehran on Tuesday to seriously
consider Russia's offer to enrich Iran's uranium in an effort to end its nuclear
standoff with countries that want to refer it to the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
But Straw also said in an interview with The Associated Press that he hoped the
International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, would decide
during its Feb. 2-3 emergency meeting to refer the nuclear standoff to the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Straw said the European allies were open to resuming talks with Iran, if it
suspends uranium enrichment activities. He urged the country's leaders to "look
much more seriously" at a compromise proposal offered by Russian President
Vladimir Putin. Putin has offered to allow uranium enrichment for Iran to be
conducted in Russia where it could be supervised.
</P>
<P>
Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, was meeting Tuesday with Russian
officials in Moscow, a day after Tehran warned that a referral to the U.N.
Security Council would lead it to immediately forge ahead with a full-scale
uranium enrichment program.
</P>
<P>
The West fears Iran wants to develop a nuclear bomb, but Tehran says its
intentions are peaceful and that it is only seeking to develop the capacity for
civilian nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France and Germany declared after Iran's decision that their two years
of talks with Tehran had reached a dead end, and they are pressing along with
the United States for the issue to be referred to the U.N. Security Council
which has the power to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Straw said Tuesday that talks about Iran would continue right up to the IAEA
decision.
</P>
<P>
"At each stage up to now there's been a high level of speculation in advance of
meetings of the IAEA," Straw said as he flew from London to Cyprus on a
three-day trip including scheduled stops in Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In each case, "a satisfactory conclusion has been reached within an
unsatisfactory situation. So I hope that that's where we'll get to. ... But each
of these negotiations has gone to the wire. I don't think this one will be any
different," he said.
</P>
<P>
Straw also praised a Turkish court's decision Monday to drop charges of
"insulting Turkishness" against international acclaimed novelist Orhan Pamuk,
but said the country still needs to boost human rights as it works toward
hoped-for membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"They've still got quite a long way to go, and they know, they don't need me to
tell them that decisions like the one to arrest the novelist Orhan Pamuk don't
help. I'm glad they decided apparently ... not to pursue it," Straw
said.
</P>
<P>
"What we want to see is a situation where the laws that apply in Turkey ... are
the same as those which apply elsewhere in the European Union."
</P>
<P>
Pamuk's trial had outraged even those favoring Turkey's membership bid by
raising questions about its commitment to freedom of speech. Dozens of people
still face similar charges, though, and the EU is about to begin a review of
Turkey's much-criticized justice system.
</P>
<P>
Straw said Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had already made
impressive changes, but that the reality of the rights situation didn't always
keep up with his legislative reforms.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on allegations by Russia's intelligence agency that four
British diplomats in Moscow were involved in espionage, or to say how the
charges might affect ties between London and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"We've got good relations with the government of Russia," he said. "Relations
will continue."
</P>
<P>
Straw is trying to build new support for a stalled Cyprus peace plan in a visit
to the divided island. Cyprus' president has refused to see Straw to protest the
foreign secretary's planned meeting with the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mehmet Ali
Talat, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I regret the decision ... but it can't deflect me from the purpose of my
visit," Straw said.
</P>
<P>
He hopes to learn whether the two sides are open to refocusing on U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's settlement plan for the war-torn island, which
was approved by Turkish Cypriots but rejected by Greek Cypriots in separate
referendums in 2004, only days before the island joined the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
He said he wasn't expecting major progress any time soon.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm very anxious to ensure is that we don't see movement backwards," he
said.

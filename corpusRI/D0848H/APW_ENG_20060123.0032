Turkey's justice minister has left a critical decision on whether to drop
charges against novelist Orhan Pamuk to a local Istanbul court, according to
officials, in an apparent attempt to avoid outraging Europe by allowing a
renowned author to stand trial for his views or angering nationalists by
dropping the case.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Cemil Cicek's decision came at a delicate time for European
Union aspirant Turkey. This week, the EU is to begin a review of the country's
justice system.
</P>
<P>
The high-profile trial has already outraged European Union officials and sparked
questions over the country's commitment to free speech.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government has made joining the EU a
cornerstone of its policy and passed sweeping reforms of Turkey's legal code. On
Oct. 3, Turkey realized one of its dreams when the EU agreed to open membership
talks with the overwhelmingly Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
The government apparently did not want to risk a face off with the EU over the
sensitive case.
</P>
<P>
The local court _ which halted the trial of Pamuk on Dec. 16, the day it began _
had asked the ministry whether it should continue with the case.
</P>
<P>
The local court could now drop the charges against Pamuk, based on a
technicality, saying the Justice Ministry's consent is missing from the
file.
</P>
<P>
Cicek, however, reiterated to the court that his ministry has no say in the
matter under the new penal code passed in June, a senior Justice Ministry
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized
to speak to the media.
</P>
<P>
"The authority in this issue belongs to (the justice system)," the state-owned
Anatolia news agency on Sunday quoted Cicek as telling the court in his written
response.
</P>
<P>
Cicek's response was sent to the court on Friday. It was not clear when the
court would issue its decision. The next hearing is on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
The local court had argued that it cannot continue the trial since there was no
approval from the justice ministry to try Pamuk for his remarks which predate
the June reform. Cicek insisted that the amendments in the penal code in June
has lifted the ministry's say over the case.
</P>
<P>
Such a decision could still outrage nationalists who pelted Pamuk's car with
eggs, shouting "Traitor!" and "Love it or leave it!" in reference to Turkey
during the opening hearing on Dec. 16.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk was charged under a law that makes insulting Turkey a crime after a Swiss
newspaper in February quoted him as saying: "30,000 Kurds and 1 million
Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about
it."
</P>
<P>
Pamuk's remarks referred to two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish
history: The massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was
not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey's overwhelmingly
Kurdish southeast.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk, author of "Snow" and "My Name is Red" and an often-mentioned candidate
for the Nobel prize in literature, said in a brief statement to the press after
the trial that "it is not good for Turkey, for our democracy, for such freedom
of expression cases to be prolonged."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has for years come under severe EU criticism for laws that stifle freedom
of speech. The nation has carried out a sweeping series of reforms to expand
freedom of expression as part of its EU membership drive, but nationalist
prosecutors and judges often still interpret laws in a restrictive
manner.

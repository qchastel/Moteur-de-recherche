ISTANBUL, Turkey

<TEXT>
<P>
The Turkish Justice Ministry on Sunday declined to
rule on whether a criminal trial of the novelist Orhan
Pamuk on a charge of insulting "Turkishness" should proceed.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry's action sent the case back to an Istanbul
court, which in December had postponed the trial, saying that
it was up to the government to decide whether to
proceed with the case.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has come under heavy criticism from international human rights groups
and governments. As the country is considered for European Union
membership, the trial is seen as a test of its
commitment to freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry on Sunday cited amendments made to the penal
code last year in saying that the court should determine
whether to proceed, the semiofficial Anatolian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some television networks here reported that the Istanbul court had already
dropped charges against the novelist following the ministry statement, but
there was no confirmation of those reports.

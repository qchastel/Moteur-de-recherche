Novelist Orhan Pamuk, facing three years in prison for remarks he made that
allegedly denigrated Turkey, said he was not surprised about facing trial and is
confident he won't go to jail.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say I was surprised to be put on trial," Pamuk wrote in a letter to
The New Yorker magazine and published in its Dec. 19 issue. The letter was
posted on the magazine's Web site, too.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "I believe that the case against me is thin; I do not think I will
end up in jail."
</P>
<P>
Pamuk will be tried Friday after Turkish prosecutors filed charges against him
for insulting Turkish identity after telling a Swiss newspaper in February that
"30,000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody but
me dares to talk about it."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Kurds killed over the past two decades during Turkey's
conflict with autonomy seeking Kurdish guerrillas, branded as a terrorist group
by the U.S. and European Union, and to Armenians killed around the time of World
War I. Armenians and several countries recognize those killings as the first
genocide of the 20th century, which Turkey vehemently denies.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the European Parliament will observe the trial.
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing was to explain why a country officially committed to entry in
the European Union would wish to imprison an author whose books were well known
in Europe," Pamuk wrote.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk has been a vocal critic of Turkish politics for many years but an adamant
supporter of the country's bid to join the EU. His increasingly political
writings have made him a figure of much controversy here.

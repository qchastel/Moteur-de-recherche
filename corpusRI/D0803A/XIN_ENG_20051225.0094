China's safety supervisor said

The State Administration of Coal Mine Work Safety announced

According to regulations on coal mine work safety promulgated 
by the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, coal mines which failed
to get safety licenses within a certain duration must stop 
production for rectification. If they could not pass the safety 
check later, the mines should be shut down.

By Dec. 19, altogether 12,990 coal mines were ordered to stop 
production due to safety problems and 2,411 of them have been 
closed down, said sources with the administration.

regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety.

that from January to September this year, 4,228 people had been 
killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents.

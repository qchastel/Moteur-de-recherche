China exclusive: 473 mln yuan of official's investment in coal 
mines withdrawn
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING, Nov. 1 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 4,578 officials 
nationwide have admitted they have stakes in coal mines, with 
total capital of 653 million yuan. Some 473 million yuan have been
withdrawn by Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
It was announced by Chen Changzhi, vice Minister of Supervision,
on Tuesday at a press conference jointly organized by the Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of 
China (CPC), Ministry of Supervision, the Commission for 
Supervision and Management of State-owned Properties and the 
National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and 
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Forcing officials to withdraw investment in coal mines is 
widely regarded as an important step to curb frequent coal mine 
accidents. Investigation showed that a large number of coal mine 
accidents occurred because unlawful and unsafe coal mines were 
given a green light to operate by local governments after 
officials obtained stakes in the coal mines.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months, the death toll of coal mine 
accidents across China rose 8.5 percent from the same period last 
year. In particular, the death toll of major coal mine accidents, 
defined as having cost at least 10 deaths, went up 168.2 percent 
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
On March 14, 18 miners died in a coal mine explosion in Qitaihe
County of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. Police found 
that the coal mine owner was actually a deputy director of the 
local work safety watchdog.
</P>
<P>
In August, China issued a circular requiring all officials who 
had invested in coal mines to retract stakes. Five inspection 
groups, dispatched by the central government, went to 10 provinces
to oversee  officials to retract their stakes in coal mines.
</P>
<P>
Special leading groups were set up in every province, 
responsible for handling registration of officials' stakes in coal
mines.
</P>
<P>
Li Yizhong, director of the National Bureau of Production 
Safety Supervision and Administration, said "The deals between 
power and money, conducted by coal mine owners in collusion with 
local officials, were unbearably rampant."
</P>
<P>
Some officials bought coal mine stakes to obtain bonuses, some
acted as coal mine owners themselves, some accepted bribes from 
coal mine owners when issuing coal mine operation permits, some 
acted as protective shields for coal mine owners after accepting 
bribes and some helped coal mine owners hide death tolls when 
accidents occurred, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said officials who refused to register their stakes in 
coal mines within the required time limit or pretended to withdraw
stakes but actually still held the stakes, would be removed from 
their posts.
</P>
<P>
Li disclosed that citizens who offer important clues on illegal
investment by officials in coal mines will be awarded, in order to
stimulate citizens to play a bigger role in combating government 
corruption.

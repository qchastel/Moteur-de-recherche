Despite government promises to stem the carnage, the death toll in China's
disaster-plagued coal mine industry is rising, according to the latest
statistics released by the government Friday.

<P>
The official Xinhua News Agency reported that the industry suffered 2,337
accidents that killed 4,228 people between January and September this
year.

According to earlier figures, fires, floods and other accidents in coal mines
killed 4,153 people in the first nine months of 2004.

"The government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve the
country's coal mine safety situation," the Xinhua said. "However, the situation
is still serious."

By Oct. 10 this year there had been 43 coal mine accidents that killed 10 or
more people, Xinhua said.

China's mines are said to be the most dangerous in the world, with more than
6,000 miners killed last year in fires, explosions, floods, cave-ins and other
disasters.

The government says it has shut down hundreds of unsafe mines and punished mine
owners who put profits ahead of lives.

The latest statistics were revealed Thursday at a Beijing conference focused on
South African coal mine safety technology and equipment, Xinhua
said.

<P>
China's coal mine safety watchdog 
has ordered the closing down of at least 4,000 coal mines, the 
People's Daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal 
mine-related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of 
lives between Nov. 3 and 8.

Zhao Tiechui, director of the National Bureau of Production 
Safety Supervision and Administration, revealed on Monday that so 
far, 12,148 coal mines have been ordered to suspend production for
rectification. Among them, 1,870 were closed for safety reasons.

Coal is the major energy resource in China, covering 67 percent
of the country's consumption structure of all primary energy 
resources.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of 
regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety.
</P>
<P>
But, the situation is still grave. Official statistics said 
that from January to September this year, 4,228 people were killed
in 2,337 coal mine accidents. Up to Oct. 10, there were 43 major 
accidents nationwide. A major accident means more than 10 deaths 
at one time.

<P>
Two more mine accidents left at least 16 
dead and 22 missing in China, state media said Wednesday, continuing 
a black week for the industry, which has been rattled by four deadly 
disasters.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 miners were killed and 18 more were missing after a 
coal mine in southwest China flooded late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy, which happened at the Longtan Coal Mine in Sichuan 
province, coincided with six people being killed by an unknown gas 
at an illegal pit in northeast Liaoning province, Xinhua news agency 
reported.
</P>
<P>
So far this week, four mine disasters have claimed the lives of 
at least 60 workers and left 26 others missing.
</P>
<P>
Survivors are rarely found from the regular gas explosions that 
rock mines in China, but the chances of finding people alive in 
floods have proven to be be marginally better.
</P>
<P>
Nine escaped from the molybdenum mine in the Gangtun township of 
Liaoning and were arrested, Xinhua said, while four were reported 
missing. Molybdenum is a silvery white metal used in making alloys 
and electrodes.
</P>
<P>
While much of China was shut down for the National Day holiday 
week, the unrelenting demand for coal to drive the country's booming 
economy and rapid industrialization forces many mines to remain 
open, around the clock.
</P>
<P>
It is the voracious demand that results in so many accidents, 
with safety procedures ignored in the quest for profits.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, 34 miners were killed and 19 injured in a gas 
explosion at a pit in the central province of Henan. 
</P>
<P>
The mine was operated by a large state-run enterprise -- the 
Henan Hebi Coal company -- but even it ignored safety procedures, 
government officials admitted.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Wednesday, the National Bureau of Production 
Safety Supervision and Administration said problems existed in gas 
ventilation management and workplace management at the mine as well 
as production safety.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, the Henan mine was operating with 
outdated equipment. 
</P>
<P>
It ordered the company, which had assets worth 4.6 billion yuan 
(567 million dollars) in 2004 and runs eight major mines with annual 
production at over seven million tons, to close all its pits to 
check safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
The demands follow an order from Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday 
for mine bosses to do more to prevent accidents.
</P>
<P>
His comments came after a gas blast in the northwest Xinjiang 
region at the privately-run Yateur mine, in which 10 workers died 
and four others remained missing. Rescuers said there was little 
hope anyone would be found alive.
</P>
<P>
China relies on coal for two-thirds of its energy needs and is 
not expected to shift significantly to other fuel sources for years 
to come.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to improve safety, China in August ordered 7,000 
coal mines to suspend operations by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But critics argue that shutdowns only exacerbate coal shortages 
and force mines elsewhere to increase capacity at the expense of 
safety.

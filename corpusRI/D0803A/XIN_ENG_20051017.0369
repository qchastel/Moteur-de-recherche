</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
836 officials and state-owned 
enterprise (SOE) leaders have abandoned their coal mine 
investments in north China's Shanxi province, a major coal 
producing region, amid a nationwide crackdown on illegal coal mine
investment by officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial government, those officials and SOE
leaders have relinquished coal mine investments worth more than 40
million yuan (nearly 5 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 30, China issued a circular requiring all officials and
SOE leaders with coal mine investments to withdraw their stakes, 
setting Sept. 22 as the deadline.
</P>
<P>
It said if the officials refused to relinquish the illegal 
investments, they would be removed from their posts.
</P>
<P>
The circular was issued against the backdrop of frequent coal 
mine accidents in China. Li Yizhong, director of the National 
Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, has 
said the collusion between mine owners and officials is to be 
condemned.
</P>
<P>
Some coal mines are owned or partly-owned by local officials. 
These mines always escape inspection and become black holes 
devouring miners' lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China recorded some 2,700 mining 
fatalities in the first half of this year, 3 percent higher than 
last year. The 24 most deadly accidents claimed a total of 704 
lives, a year-on-year increase of 114 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months, Shanxi witnessed 90 coal mine 
accidents in which 316 lives were lost. The six deadliest 
accidents occurred at illegally operated coal mines, claiming 183 
lives.
</P>
<P>
Investigation of these accidents showed that some officials 
collaborate with mine owners to make illegal coal mines appear to 
be legal.
</P>
<P>
Up to Sept. 30, reports from 11 Shanxi cities showed that 922 
officials and SOE leaders were involved in coal mine businesses, 
with a total investment of over 92 million yuan (11 million US 
dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Li, national figures about officials and SOE 
leaders who relinquished coal mine investments will be released in
mid-October.

Freed by warming, waters once locked beneath ice
are gnawing at coastal settlements around the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
In Bykovsky, a village of 457 on Russia's northeast coast, the
shoreline is collapsing, creeping closer and closer to houses and
tanks of heating oil, at a rate of 15 to
18 feet a year. Eventually, homes will be lost, and
maybe all of Bykovsky. "It is eating up the land,"
said Innokenty Koryakin, a member of the Evenk tribe and
the captain of a fishing boat. "You cannot do anything
about it."
</P>
<P>
For the 4 million people who live north of the Arctic
Circle, in remote outposts and the improbable industrial centers built
by Soviet decree, a changing climate presents new opportunities. But
it also threatens their environment, their homes and, for those
whose traditions rely on the ice-bound wilderness, their culture.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of vast petroleum fields in the Barents and Kara
Seas has raised fears of catastrophic accidents in the fisheries
of Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
In Russia, 20 percent of which lies above the Arctic Circle,
melting of the permafrost threatens the foundations of homes, factories,
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Coastal erosion is a problem in Alaska as well, forcing the
United States to prepare to relocate several Inuit villages at
a projected cost of $100 million or more for each
one.
</P>
<P>
Across the Arctic, indigenous tribes like the Inuit and the Samis,
or Laplanders, whose traditions shaped by centuries of living in
extremes of cold and ice are noticing changes in weather
and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
As much as a quarter of the world's remaining oil and
gas resources are believed to exist in the Arctic. And
as technology improves, oil prices rise and the seasonal ice
cap retreats, oil shipments from countries like Norway and Russia
are soaring.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Environment Program estimated that 15 percent of the region's
lands were affected in 2001 by mining, oil and gas
exploration, ports or other industrial incursions. But that figure is
likely to reach 80 percent in 2050, it said.

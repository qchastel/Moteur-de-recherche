Scientists: Greenland glaciers pick up speed because of warming

<P>
Two of Greenland's largest glaciers are retreating at an alarming pace, most
likely because of climate warming, scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But researchers at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union also
presented studies of the retreat of Alaska's Columbia Glacier that suggest more
complexity in the processes of glacial melt.
</P>
<P>
One of the Greenland glaciers, Kangerdlugssuaq, is currently moving at about
nine miles (15 kilometers) a year compared to three miles (5 kilometers) a year
in 2001, said Gordon Hamilton of the University of Maine's Climate Change
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The other glacier, Helheim, is speeding at about seven miles (11 kilometers) a
year _ up from four miles (6.5 kilometers) a year during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a staggering rate of increase," Hamilton said during the AGU
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Glaciers worldwide play a major role in discharging flowing water into
oceans.
</P>
<P>
Sea levels have swelled globally an estimated 4 inches to 8 inches (10
centimeters to 20 centimeters) over the past century due to melting glaciers and
polar ice _ enough to cause some low-lying places to be awash at high tide or
during severe storms.
</P>
<P>
Melting of Greenland ice and calving of icebergs from glaciers is responsible
for about 7 percent of the annual rise in global sea level.
</P>
<P>
Global warming is frequently blamed for retreating glaciers around the world.
The rapid retreat of Greenland glaciers suggest that climate change is a factor,
Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one of the fastest melting glaciers in North America has reached the
halfway point of disintegration and will continue retreat for another two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Alaska's Columbia Glacier _ about the size of Los Angeles _ has shrunk nine
miles (15 kilometers) since the 1980s. It is expected to lose an additional nine
miles (15 kilometers) in the next 15 to 20 years before the bed of the glacier
rises above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The glacier, which moves about 80 feet (24 meters) a day, currently releases
about 2 cubic miles (8.3 cubic kilometers) of ice every year into the Prince
William Sound on the south coast of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
Understanding what happens during Alaskan glacier retreat could help explain the
phenomenon in Greenland, said Tad Pfeffer, associate director of the University
of Colorado's Institute of Arctic and Alpine.
</P>
<P>
Pfeffer said climate change warming trends do not directly explain the shrinking
Columbia Glacier and other tidewater glaciers. Instead, scientists think the
retreat is triggered by a slow warming trend that began five centuries
ago.
</P>
<P>
Significant thinning of the Columbia Glacier is thought to be caused by huge
chunks of iceberg that break off into the sound as a result of seawater pressure
rather than climate change, Pfeffer said.
</P>
<P>
The glacier, which is up to 3,000 feet (915 meters) thick, has thinned up to
1,300 feet (390 meters) in some places over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1970s, scientists have monitored the Columbia Glacier with satellites,
lasers and aerial photography and found that the increase of its so-called
calving rate might be dangerous to shipping lanes in the sound.

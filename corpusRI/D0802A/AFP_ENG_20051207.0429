<P>
Environment ministers from around the 
world heard a grim warning about the threat to the Arctic Wednesday 
as they began three days of talks to climax a key conference on 
climate change here.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, whose country is hosting 
the 12-day conference, said his nation's far north had become "an 
incubator for the altered world of tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
"High in the Arctic, in our interior and along our coasts, the 
country we know is being transformed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Winters are growing milder, summers hotter and more severe, 
there is plant life where before there was none; there is water 
before there was ice. Our permafrost is thawing, and releasing 
methane gas into the atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Within short decades, the Northwest passage, the 
famously unnavigable thoroughfare of history, may be passable -- a 
striking and unsettling example of our delicate balance succumbing 
to untenable strain."
</P>
<P>
Martin blasted the small but influential minority of skeptics 
who doubted that Man had interfered with Earth's delicate climate 
balance.
</P>
<P>
"The time is past to debate the impact of climate change. We no 
longer need to ask people to imagine its effects, for now we can see 
them."
</P>
<P>
The conference gathers ministers or their stand-ins from 189 
countries and entities under the UN Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC), the fruit of the 1992 Rio Summit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting's big focus is the future of the Kyoto Protocol, the 
troubled UN pact on curbing greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
Emissions of this carbon pollution have surged in the past 
century thanks to unbridled use of oil, gas and coal.
</P>
<P>
The gases act like an invisible blanket, trapping the Sun's heat 
and driving up the planet's surface temperature and disrupting 
climate cycles.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say there is mounting evidence that the first effects 
of climate change are already kicking in, with the melting of Alpine 
and Himalayan glaciers and erosion of Arctic and Antarctic 
icesheets.
</P>
<P>
They also speculate that this year's unprecedented season of 
Atlantic storms, spearheaded by Hurricane Katrina which devastated 
New Orleans, was caused by global warming.
</P>
<P>
Tackling the pollution is a big headache because of the economic 
cost.
</P>
<P>
Rich countries, which are most to blame for the problem, will 
have to make big strides in fuel efficiency and switch to cleaner 
energy sources.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries, meanwhile, will have to avoid becoming 
dependent on fossil fuels, which have a big cost advantage over 
fledging alternative technologies.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the world's No. 1 carbon polluter, walked 
away from Kyoto in 2001.
</P>
<P>
President George W. Bush said the scientific evidence for 
climate change was incomplete and complained that Kyoto's legal 
requirements for reducing emissions were too costly for the US 
economy.
</P>
<P>
Martin made a veiled attack on this position by warning that 
no-one was immune from climate change.
</P>
<P>
"The time is past to seek comfort in denial. The time is past to 
pretend that any nation can stand alone, isolated from the global 
community... there can be no hiding on any island, in any city, 
within any country, no matter how prosperous, from the consequences 
of inaction."

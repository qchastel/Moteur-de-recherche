Arctic Warming Leaves Siberian Lakes Dry
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An accelerating Arctic warming trend over the past quarter century
has dramatically dried up more than a thousand large lakes in Siberia,
probably because the permafrost beneath them has begun to thaw,
according to a paper set to be published Friday in the journal
Science.

Comparing satellite images captured in the early 1970s to those
from recent years, a team of American scientists determined that the
number of large lakes in a vast, 200,000-square-mile region of Siberia
diminished by about 11 percent -- from 10,882 to 9,712.

<P>
About 125 of the 1,170 shrunken lakes disappeared altogether, and
most are now considerably smaller than the study's baseline of 40
hectares, or roughly 99 acres, the researchers found.
</P>
<P>
If Arctic temperatures continue to rise, the scientists warned,
many of the lakes that are now ubiquitous in high northern latitudes
could eventually disappear.
</P>

``An 11 percent decline may not sound like much, but in the
time-scale in which landscapes naturally change, this is
extraordinarily fast,'' said the paper's lead author, Laurence C.
Smith, an associate geology professor at the University of California,
Los Angeles. He conducted the research with UCLA colleague Glen M.
MacDonald, Yongwei Sheng of the State University of New York, and
Larry Hinzman of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.

While the researchers did not determine the cause of the losses,
they found that the location of disappearing lakes in areas of Siberia
where permafrost, formerly frozen as solid as concrete, is now known
to be softening. They believe the lakes are receding because the water
is seeping into the increasingly mushy ground, a finding that
scientists already have confirmed in portions of Alaska where Arctic
lakes are also drying up.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the scientists found that in Siberian areas where the
ground below is still permanently frozen, the number of lakes actually
increased by about 4 percent and total lake area grew by about 12
percent over the past three decades. That is consistent with
scientific predictions that in the short run, global warming would
lead to more shallow ponds and lakes in thermokarst, or small pits and
depressions caused by a thawing of turf at ground level.

Average Arctic temperatures have risen at nearly twice the rate of
overall global temperatures in recent decades, according to the Arctic
Climate Impact Assessment, a comprehensive evaluation of warming in
the region conducted by eight nations and six organizations of
indigenous people. In Alaska and western Canada, temperatures have
increased by as much as 7 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 50 years,
according to the assessment, which was concluded last year.

<P>
Although the regions experiencing the changes are not home to high
numbers of humans, the loss of surface water is expected to affect
freshwater supplies for native people in the Arctic. It is also
predicted to have more immediate and profound effects on Arctic
ecosystems, notably the lake habitat many migratory birds rely upon,
Smith said.

``If you were to lose the Arctic lakes, that would be hugely
important for waterfowl,'' MacDonald said. ``If permafrost continues
to melt, it could also affect everything from oil platforms to landing
strips. In west Siberia, there is not much geology there aside from
the permafrost and peatlands. If the permafrost goes away, the lakes
are going to go away.''

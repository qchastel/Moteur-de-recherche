Dramatic collapse of Antarctic ice shelf linked to global 
warming

<P>
The collapse of a huge ice shelf in 
Antarctica in 2002 has no precedent in the past 11,000 years, 
according to a study to be published on Thursday that points the 
finger at global warming.
</P>
<P>
Measuring some 3,250 square kilometers (1,250 sq. miles) in area 
and 220 metres (715 feet) thick, the Larsen B iceshelf broke away 
from the eastern Antarctic Peninsula in 2002, eventually 
disintegrating into giant icebergs.
</P>
<P>
By chance, a US-led team of geologists had gathered a rich 
harvest of data around the iceshelf just before the spectacular 
collapse, including six cores that had been drilled into marine 
sediment.
</P>
<P>
The cores contain the remains of plankton and algae imbedded in 
layers of minerals, and their radiocarbon and oxygen isotopes 
provide clues about ice cover and climate change over the 
millennia.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, reporting in Nature, the British science 
weekly, say that since the end of the last Ice Age, some 11,000 
years ago, the iceshelf had been intact but had slowly thinned, by 
several dozen metres (several dozen feet).
</P>
<P>
Its coup de grace came from a recent but decades-long rise in 
air temperature, they say.
</P>
<P>
"The modern collapse of the LIS-B [Larsen B iceshelf] is a 
unique event within the Holocene," they write. 
</P>
<P>
"The LIS-B eventually thinned to the point where it succumbed to 
the prolonged period of regional warming now affecting the entire 
Antarctic Peninsula region."
</P>
<P>
The Holocene is the period of relatively balmy weather that 
followed the last Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
The research is the latest in a series of studies to sound the 
alarm about the effects of climate change in Antarctica, where the 
bulk of the world's freshwater is locked up.
</P>
<P>
The Antarctic Peninsula, which juts northwards out of West 
Antarctica, is considered a warming hot-spot.
</P>
<P>
Over the past half century, temperatures in the peninsula have 
risen by around 2 C (3.6 F).
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the peninsula has lost ice shelves totalling 
more than 12,500 sq. kms (4,826 sq. miles), equivalent to four times 
the area of Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 244 glaciers that drain inland ice and feed these 
shelves, 87 percent have fallen back since the mid-1950s, according 
to a British study published in April.
</P>
<P>
Global warming, also called the greenhouse effect, is caused by 
carbon gases mostly discharged by burning oil, gas and coal, that 
trap the Sun's heat.
</P>
<P>
But Earth's climate also goes through natural oscillations of 
warming and cooling, resulting in Ice Ages and the milder 
interglacial periods inbetween.
</P>
<P>
The new study does not say that man-made global warming was 
responsible for the Larsen B's demise.
</P>
<P>
However, it refers to a steep rise in the temperatures over the 
past several decades, a phenomenon that climatologists concur was 
unleashed by fossil fuels.

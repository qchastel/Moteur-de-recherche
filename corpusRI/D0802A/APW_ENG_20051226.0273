Climate change could thaw the top 11 feet (3.35 meters) of permafrost in most
areas of the Northern Hemisphere by 2100, altering ecosystems across Alaska,
Canada and Russia, according to a federal study.

Using supercomputers in the United States and Japan, the study calculated how
frozen soil would interact with air temperatures, snow, sea ice changes and
other processes. The most extreme scenario involved the melting of the top 11
feet of permafrost, or earth that remains frozen year-round.

"If that much near-surface permafrost thaws, it could release considerable
amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and that could amplify global
warming," said lead author David Lawrence, with the National Center for
Atmospheric Research. "We could be underestimating the rate of global
temperature increase."

The study was published Dec. 17 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters and
presented earlier in the month at a science conference in San
Francisco.

A permafrost researcher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, however,
disagrees that the thaw could be so large. Alaska's permafrost won't melt that
fast or deep, said Vladimir Romanovsky, who monitors a network of permafrost
observatories for the Geophysical Institute.

<P>
If air temperatures increase 2 to 4 degrees over the next century, permafrost
would begin thawing south of the Brooks Range and start degrading in some places
on Alaska's Arctic slope, he said. But a prediction that melting will reach
deeply over the entire region goes too far, he said.
</P>
<P>
The computer climate model didn't consider some natural factors that tend to
keep the permafrost cold, Romanovsky said. For example, deeper permafrost,
largely untouched by recent warming at the surface, would have an
influence.

Lawrence said he hopes to collaborate with Romanovsky to fine-tune future
studies to deal with those deeper layers.

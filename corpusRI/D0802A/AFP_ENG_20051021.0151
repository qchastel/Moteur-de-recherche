Scientists fear collapsing ice shelves will hasten higher sea

<P>
US and European scientists fear the 
collapse of ice shelves in Greenland and Antarctica will raise ocean 
levels faster than estimated, said a report published Friday in the 
journal Science.
</P>
<P>
The rapid breakdown of the floating ice shelves observed in 
recent years, the experts said, could destabilize land-based ice 
sheets and glaciers behind them and cause faster melting and rise in 
sea levels than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Current projections for rises in sea levels do not take into 
account the new hypothesis, said Peter Clark, professor of 
geosciences at Oregon State University.
</P>
<P>
"We may be more vulnerable to sea level rise than we thought and 
it may be more rapid than we have anticipated," Clark said. "This is 
an issue we should take very seriously."
</P>
<P>
Current projections in climate models suggest that global 
warming during the next century or two will cause thermal expansion 
of water and some melting of glacial ice chiefly in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
However, that may be largely offset by increased precipitation 
and glacial buildup in Antarctica, leading to increased sea level of 
about 50 centimeters
</P>
<P>
(20 inches) the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of glaciers currently being studied, said Clark, 
could double the sea level rise to a full meter.
</P>
<P>
And in a span of about 1,000 years, he added, the Greenland ice 
sheet may disappear, raising Earth's sea level by about six meters 
(20 feet). Glacial breakdown mechanisms currently being studied 
could speed that up considerably.
</P>
<P>
"It's become clear that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, much of 
which sits on land that's actually below sea level, is one of the 
most vulnerable in the world to these types of rapid breakdowns," 
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
"The real problem would occur if these smaller glacial breakups 
trigger larger ones, and rising sea levels by themselves might cause 
a feedback mechanism which would further speed up the process," the 
scientist added.

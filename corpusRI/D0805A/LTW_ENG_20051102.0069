Making Sense of the New Medicare Drug Program
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Which one should I pick?
</P>
<P>
Millions of people are asking that question as they consider
Medicare's new prescription drug plan, which rolls out Jan. 1. The
voluntary program -- also known as Medicare Part D -- will allow
seniors and the disabled who are covered under the Medicare program to
get subsidized drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
Medicare beneficiaries have been bombarded with mail, phone calls
and advertisements over the last several weeks from plans eager to
sign them up. Enrollment starts Nov 15.
</P>
<P>
By now, they've probably realized it's more confusing than anything
else.
</P>
<P>
Medicare beneficiaries have many plans to choose from -- each with
its own premium, lists of covered drugs and participating pharmacies.
The Bush administration estimates the coverage (which will cost the
federal government at least $720 billion during the first 10 years)
will save beneficiaries an average of $1,300 a year. But in fact, the
savings can vary wildly depending on factors such as what kind of drug
coverage someone currently has or to how much they spend on
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
A person who spends $1,500 a year on prescriptions, for example,
can save about $550 on the new plan. But another person who spends
just $500 may actually pay $198 more out of pocket because of premiums
and drug co-payments.
</P>
<P>
How to make a choice among the blizzard of plans? ``You don't have
to understand every detail and every option,'' said Dr. Mark
McClellan, administrator of the federal Medicare agency. ``People just
need to focus on what they want.''
</P>
<P>
Following are some highlights and things to consider about the new
drug plan.
</P>
<P>
ELIGIBILITY
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest misconceptions about the new drug benefit is
that it's only for low-income seniors. In fact, all Medicare
beneficiaries are eligible. People won't be automatically enrolled,
however. Enrollees have to choose a plan and sign up through a private
insurer or with Medicare, either on the agency's phone or its Web
site.
</P>
<P>
DECIDING IF IT'S WORTH IT
</P>
<P>
The plans make most sense for people who are already spending a lot
of money on prescription drugs, and for low-income seniors, who may be
eligible for financial assistance with premiums and drug co-payments.
</P>
<P>
The costs for each plan can vary considerably depending on what's
offered. This year, monthly premiums vary from nothing to as high as
$60 a month, although cheaper plans usually have much leaner coverage,
with higher deductibles and fewer covered drugs.
</P>
<P>
WHICH PLAN TO PICK
</P>
<P>
This essentially boils down to what prescriptions you use and how
you like to pay for them, and the kind of medical coverage you have.
</P>
<P>
Plans can look very different, because the government is allowing
insurers to structure them as they want. They merely have to be
``actuarially equivalent'' to each other -- they must, in other words,
provide the same benefit in the end. For most people, the first $250
is not covered, but the next $2,000 is -- except for any co-payments
you may have to make. Following this, you will have to pay the next
$1,350: Experts refer to this as a ``doughnut hole'' in coverage. But
after that, 95 percent of drugs are covered, which is meant to help
people with catastrophically high drug costs in any given year.
</P>
<P>
There are two classes of plans among the dozens of offerings. The
one you'll pick will depend on whether you're buying just a drug plan
or adding it to your current managed care plan.
</P>
<P>
Seniors who choose to stay in Medicare's traditional
fee-for-service plan can only buy what's called a stand-alone
prescription drug plan. Those who are in Medicare Advantage HMO plans
-- about one-fourth of all beneficiaries -- will now get the drug
benefit added to their current planWhether the premium will rise, and
by how much, depends on the plan.
</P>
<P>
``People need to sit down, take a breath and figure out what is
best for them,'' said Bonnie Burns, Medicare policy and training
specialist for California Health Advocates, a nonprofit Medicare
education and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYER DRUG COVERAGE: KEEP IT OR NOT
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of Medicare recipients have drug coverage through
a former employer, which is often better than the coverage the
government is offering. Think hard before dumping that coverage,
experts say. ``Retirees who cancel their employer coverage and take
the new federal benefit may not be able to go back if they later
realize they've made a mistake,'' said Tricia Neuman, director of the
Medicare Policy Project at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
WHICH DRUGS ARE COVERED, WHICH AREN'T
</P>
<P>
Don't automatically assume that the medications you currently take
will be covered by a new plan. Each insurer will have its own list of
covered drugs, known as a formulary. If you take lots of medications
-- especially if they're expensive ones -- you'll want to carefully go
over each plan and make sure those drugs are on the list. Check if
your pharmacy is covered too. Something else to consider: Several
plans offer discounts for people who use generic brands.
</P>
<P>
If a drug plan decides to remove a drug you use from its formulary
in the future, they must notify you 60 days in advance. You will be
able to switch your plan, but you may have to wait till the next
enrollment period.
</P>
<P>
WHEN TO SIGN UP
</P>
<P>
You can sign up any time from Nov. 15 through May 15, 2006. If you
sign up after that, you may face a penalty of 1 percent a month until
you enroll. That also applies to people who turn 65 after May and
delay signing up. For example, the premium for someone who is 65 or
older who waits four years may be 48 percent higher for the rest of
his or her life. Remember: This is an insurance plan, and it may make
sense to sign up now. Even someone who doesn't use a lot of
prescriptions today may come to use more as they get older. You can
switch your plan once a year.
</P>
<P>
IF THE NEW DRUG PLAN IS TOO COSTLY
</P>
<P>
About one-third of enrollees will qualify for some type of
financial assistance. If your annual income is less than about $14,000
(or $19,000 per couple) and you have less than $11,500 in assets
($23,000 per couple), not including your home or car, you are eligible
for additional assistance. The amount will vary depending on your
exact situation. If you think you qualify, you should contact your
local Social Security office.
</P>
<P>
WEIGHING THE PLANS AGAINST MEDIGAP
</P>
<P>
Medigap is private insurance that seniors can purchase to pay for
costs Medicare doesn't cover, which up until now has included
prescription drugs. But because the government is heavily subsidizing
the new Medicare drug plan and doesn't subsidize Medigap plans,
Medigap will prove more costly for most people, and they should
switch.
</P>
<P>
DEMISE OF THE DRUG DISCOUNT CARD
</P>
<P>
In 2003, after Congress passed legislation for the new drug
benefit, seniors were given temporary discount drug cards to carry
them over until the plan began. You can continue to use your
Medicare-approved drug discount card until you enroll in a Part D
plan. But whether you sign up or not, on May 15, 2006, the card will
stop working.

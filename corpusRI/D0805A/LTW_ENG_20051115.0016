The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:

Over the past few days, the Medicare.gov Web site has been jammed.
Tuesday, it could grind to a halt. That's because it's the first day
of open enrollment for Medicare Part D, the Medicare drug benefit for
seniors. Already, anecdotal and polling evidence shows that many
seniors are baffled by the benefit, which requires beneficiaries to
choose from several dozen private plans. More than six in 10 told a
Kaiser Family Foundation pollster that they understand the new drug
benefit ``not too well'' or ``not at all.'' Only one in five said that
they plan to enroll. Worse, more than three-quarters said they have
never used the Internet, although the Medicare.gov Web site provides
the most efficient means of comparing the different plans.

All of that bodes ill for a benefit that its creators have promoted
as the wave of the future: the first example of 21st-century,
public-private health cooperation. But as seniors start signing up --
and they have until May 15, when a late fee kicks in -- it's important
not to judge the plan by the inevitable initial glitches and
anticipatory fears. For one, it is possible that seniors, by
gravitating toward the simplest plans, will force the system to become
simpler.

In the long term, the benefit's success will be measured in at
least two ways. The first is by cost: to seniors and to the
government. At the moment, the average senior will pay about $32 in
monthly premiums, some $5 less than predicted. The average government
subsidy per person is running at $94 monthly, rather than $109. These
savings are the result of better-than-expected competition among
private insurance companies, many of whom got better-than-expected
deals from drug manufacturers. The real test, though, is whether those
are lasting savings or whether the insurers will find it necessary to
raise costs over time.

The other (related) measure of success is how many seniors enroll.
Former Louisiana Sen. John Breaux, D, one of the benefit's
congressional authors and now chairman of the Medicare Rx Education
Network, reckons that the benefit will be a success if half of
eligible seniors enroll. But that's just an estimate: The real test is
whether enough healthy people stay in the program to keep insurance
companies interested in offering it and to keep premiums low.

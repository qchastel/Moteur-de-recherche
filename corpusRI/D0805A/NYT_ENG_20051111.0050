WASHINGTON - Nearly two years after President Bush signed into law
the most sweeping change in Medicare's history, beneficiaries can begin
signing up Tuesday for coverage of their prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
Despite recent polls showing widespread confusion about how the benefit will
work and concern that the coverage choices are too complicated,
administration officials say they are confident the drug program will
catch on.
</P>
<P>
By the time the open enrollment period ends next May 15,
beneficiaries will have a better understanding of the program and
"those polls will change," said Health and Human Services Secretary
Michael Leavitt, in a conference call with reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of a new era in Medicare," Leavitt
said. "We will slowly build understanding."
</P>
<P>
Administration officials stress there is no need for beneficiaries to hastily
enroll. The drug benefit will not take effect until Jan.
1, 2006, and beneficiaries can continue signing up until May
15, 2006, without paying a penalty. But those who are
eligible and do not sign up by then will pay
a 1 percent a month penalty when they do enroll.
The next enrollment period after May 15 will be in
November 2006.
</P>
<P>
With the enrollment period about to begin and beneficiaries being flooded
with information from Medicare and dozens of prescription drug providers,
interest in the program is quickly growing.
</P>
<P>
"More and more people are starting to pay attention." said Lisa
Nora, coordinator and volunteer specialist at the Medicare Answers Prescription
Savings Center in West Palm Beach, Fla. "They know that
they have to make a decision."
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the federal government is working with about 10,000 local organizations
to provide assistance, Leavitt said. That help will be needed,
experts say, because the program is so complicated.
</P>
<P>
Advocates of a drug benefit for the elderly had lobbied for
years to expand the program within Medicare, but when Congress
finally acted, it tossed the benefit to the private sector
with a hefty government subsidy. The result is that beneficiaries
must enroll in private plans - not in Medicare directly
- for the prescription drug benefit known as Medicare Part
D.
</P>
<P>
In virtually every state, beneficiaries are confronted with more than 40
competing drug plans, many of them different options offered by
the same company. It's like deciding which cell phone service
to buy from competing companies and then selecting a particular
calling plan within the chosen company.
</P>
<P>
A survey of Medicare beneficiaries late last month found that more
than 60 percent said they do not understand the new
drug law.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation and the
Harvard School of Public Health, also found that 37 percent
of beneficiaries said they do not plan to enroll in
a plan; 43 percent were undecided and only 20 percent
said they planned to enroll for the drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
Most elderly who have not followed the issue are unaware that
they have so many plans to choose from. When told
they have so many choices, nearly three-fourths said that "makes
it confusing and difficult to pick the best plan" while
22 percent said it "provides an opportunity to choose the
best plan."
</P>
<P>
Critics of the drug law have argued for months that it
is too complex. They also have argued that if Medicare
purchased drugs directly, the way the Department of Veterans Affairs
does for veterans, beneficiaries would pay much less.
</P>
<P>
Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, which opposed the drug
bill when it was in Congress, said its flaws "are
producing bewilderment and confusion among seniors" and will also result
in a far more costly program.
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Mark McClellan, head of the federal Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services, said competition among the private plans has
resulted in lower premiums, lower deductibles and lower copayments than
had been predicted.
</P>
<P>
A study of the prices scheduled to be charged under the
drug law for the top 25 most commonly prescribed medications
used by the elderly found that the drug benefit will
result in average savings of 20 percent on brand name
drugs bought at a retail pharmacy and 27 percent through
a mail order pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
For generic drugs, the savings are 44 percent for retail and
64 percent for mail order. The study, based on filings
with the Medicare program, was conducted by the Pharmaceutical Care
Management Association, the national trade organization representing pharmacy benefit managers.
</P>
<P>
McClellan said he was unconcerned that more than a third of
Medicare beneficiaries say they don't intend to enroll in a
drug plan because most of them have more generous coverage
through a former employer. The Medicare drug law provides substantial
incentives for employers to continue to offer retiree drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 40 million elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries
nationwide, administration officials expect about 28 million to 30 million
to enroll in a drug plan or remain in a
federally subsidized retiree plan.
</P>
<P>
That includes about 10 million retirees with employer-sponsored coverage, 12 million
very low income people whose drug coverage automatically will be
switched from Medicaid to Medicare, and 6 million in Medicare
managed care plans that already provide drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
To help beneficiaries wade through the various plans, Medicare has created
a series of tools that can compare costs and benefits.
Those tools - available on the Internet at www.medicare.gov or
by calling the Medicare hotline at 1-800-633-4227 - allow beneficiaries
to list the specific drugs they take and find out
which plan will give them the best deal in terms
of cost and convenience.
</P>
<P>
The tool enables beneficiaries to compare premiums, deductibles and copayments for
each plan based on the drugs listed. It also tells
them which local pharmacies will accept the various plans, or
whether drugs can be purchased through a bulk mail-order or
online supplier.
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful tool," Nora said. "It really gets in depth
on how much you are going to save. You plug
in (the information) and it's the best thing since sliced
bread."
</P>
<P>
Drew. E. Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said it's
unclear how many beneficiaries will enroll in a plan, but
he noted that "in the long run the bigger question
is whether seniors believe they are getting?enough help with their
drug costs from the plans they are in."

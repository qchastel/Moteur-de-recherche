Confused about the new Medicare prescription drug coverage?
A new source of help is on the way.
</P>
<P>
A national coalition of senior and consumer advocacy groups said Tuesday
it will dispatch a fleet of vans equipped with wireless
computers and trained staff to North Carolina and 26 other
states. The goal: to help Medicare enrollees understand the optional
prescription drug coverage, which takes effect Jan. 1. Vans should
start rolling into the Triangle and Charlotte areas by mid-December.

The education campaign -- "My Medicare Matters" -- comes a week
after people enrolled in Medicare began signing up for the
new prescription benefits. Many older adults have complained that the
program is overly complex, and some advocates fear that people
who would be helped by the benefit will throw their
hands up and fail to sign up.

"Doing nothing ... is not the right response for America," said
James L. Firman, president of the National Council on the
Aging and chairman of the Access to Benefits Coalition, a
collection of more than 100 groups that is coordinating the
campaign.

<P>
My Medicare Matters, which is supported by a $10 million grant
from pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, will aim to help people enrolled
in Medicare get the information they need to make an
informed choice about whether to sign up for Medicare Part
D, as the new prescription coverage is known.
</P>
<P>
Its counselors will do that largely by helping people tap existing
online resources, such as the Medicare drug plan finder that
is available at www.medicare.gov. People can punch in the medicines
they take and compare prescription plans available in their area
by cost and coverage, greatly simplifying comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
However, few Medicare enrollees are using the online tool or any
of the other information Medicare makes available at its Internet
site. A national survey of Medicare members conducted recently by
the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health
found that just 6 percent of respondents had even visited
the Web site.
</P>
<P>
My Medicare Matters will supplement existing education and outreach efforts in
North Carolina. The largest single resource now operating in the
state is the N.C. Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program, which
has seen the number of calls to its information line,
at (800) 443-9354, nearly triple in recent weeks, largely because
of questions about Medicare Part D.

"Anything that is going to result in [North Carolina] having additional
counselors who are educated and can help people is wonderful,"
said Carla Obiol, the SHIIP program's director. "The magnitude of
this program change is so great we almost can't have
enough help."

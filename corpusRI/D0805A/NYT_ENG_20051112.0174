A LOT OF INFO, IF YOU CAN GET TO IT

TARPON SPRINGS - Robert Loos, 83, can Google with the best
of them.
</P>
<P>
He searches travel deals on the Internet, pays bills online and
stores crucial phone numbers in a digital address book.
</P>
<P>
So with enrollment in Medicare's new Part D drug benefit to
begin on Tuesday, Loos powered up his Compaq 7550 last
week and headed for the government's Web page.
</P>
<P>
In Florida, 19 companies are marketing 43 Medicare drug plans, and
that doesn't count the various HMOs and PPOs that people
can join.
</P>
<P>
Medicare has never been so complicated, so full of choices. It's
a classic chance for computer-savvy people to bypass commercial advertising
and free-lunch seminars by searching www.medicare.gov on their own.
</P>
<P>
Medicare literature advises people to do just that.
</P>
<P>
But Loos fiddled at it for an hour Thursday with only
mixed success. The Web site was often ponderous. It answered
some questions, but rarely quickly.
</P>
<P>
Things got worse when Loos called Medicare's toll-free hotline, 1-800-633-4227. He
meandered around in an irritating phone-tree loop for about five
minutes until he finally hung up and called back. The
second time, he found his way to one of Medicare's
8,000 new "customer service representatives," a polite, patient man who
turned out to be a fount of misinformation.
</P>
<P>
Medicare beneficiaries need not panic. They have six more weeks to
choose their 2006 coverage before it begins on Jan. 1.
That also gives Medicare's designers time to tweak the Web
site and hotline employees time to learn their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Still, Loos worries about his fellow retirees, especially those who don't
use computers.
</P>
<P>
"I can't see how older people are ever going to determine
what the best plans are," he says. "They are going
to be very confused."
</P>
<P>
Loos, who owned a trucking equipment business before retirement, does not
want to join a Medicare HMO, which usually carries drug
coverage. He and his wife, Eileen, don't want to change
doctors if an HMO shuffles its provider network.
</P>
<P>
The seven drugs Loos takes would cost more than $8,000 a
year if he bought them at his local Publix pharmacy.
Instead, he buys one from Canada, one from New Zealand
and gets two free from Merck's patient assistance program. That
winnows his bill to about $2,700 a year.
</P>
<P>
He would like to join a new Medicare Part D drug
plan because he thinks the government is going to crack
down on foreign drug importation.
</P>
<P>
When he checked www.medicare.gov, his high-speed Internet connection moved him quickly
through preliminary questions until he was asked to enter his
seven medications. Then it slowed to a crawl by forcing
him to register his medications one at a time instead
of all at once.
</P>
<P>
At one point, he tried to register Flomax and the computer
said "service unavailable." He back-tracked, tried again, and it worked
the second time.
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very time-consuming," he muttered.
</P>
<P>
After about 15 minutes, the computer finally listed how much each
plan would cost, from cheapest to most expensive, ranging from
about $3,600 to more than $8,000. When he clicked on
other buttons, Medicare's Web site showed him how he could
knock about $500 off the cheapest plan - Humana Complete
- by using its mail-order pharmacy. He could knock off
$770 more by swapping his drugs for similar ones preferred
by Humana.
</P>
<P>
That brought the cost to about $2,400 - less than he
pays now.
</P>
<P>
"Boy, there's a lot of stuff here," he said. "So far,
it's working pretty good."
</P>
<P>
After an hour, Loos was ready to quit, even though he
still lacked price-reduction information that might make other plans more
attractive. The Web site would only let him work through
one drug plan at a time, which slowed him down.
</P>
<P>
He also wanted to check which plans restrict how his doctor
can prescribe his drugs. The Humana Complete plan, for example,
required either prior-authorization, quantity limitations or "step therapy" on every
one of his seven drugs.
</P>
<P>
Maybe cheapest wasn't best.
</P>
<P>
Medicare's Web site can provide details about these restrictions. But Loos
had previously played around with that section of the Web
site and found it confusing and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Medicare's toll-free hotline could help. Medicare literature urges people to
call, particularly if they don't have access to a computer.
</P>
<P>
Medicare has 43-million beneficiaries, so it was no surprise that Loos
was greeted by a recorded female voice guiding him through
a phone tree.
</P>
<P>
When she asked if he wanted "information," that seemed like a
good choice, but it sent him into a loop of
various messages and didn't seem to tell him how to
reach a live person.
</P>
<P>
After five minutes, he hung up and tried again. This time,
he tried other options and a customer service representative came
on the line. Loos asked what various drug plans would
cost.
</P>
<P>
Would Loos like to keep his premiums and deductibles low, the
man asked. Deductibles range from zero to $250 a year.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to pay nothing if I can," Loos responded. As
for premiums, maybe something like $25 to $30 a month.
</P>
<P>
It was a mistake on both their parts. Given Loos' seven
medications, the cheapest plan is Humana Complete, with a $61-a-month
premium. Its total cost is less because it offers broader
coverage that more than makes up for the higher premium.
</P>
<P>
The Medicare worker was following a script, as trained. But when
he limited Loos' premiums to $30 or less, the computer
spit out a different Humana plan, an AARP plan and
a United HealthCare plan as the three cheapest.
</P>
<P>
Then the worker inaccurately said each of the three plans carried
co-payments of 25 percent. That's the amount for a hypothetical
boilerplate plan that Medicare uses as a guideline in its
literature. But it bears no relationship to actual co-payments.
</P>
<P>
"Who determines the cost of prescriptions?" Loos asked.
</P>
<P>
"I guess the pharmacist," said the worker, when in fact the
companies that offer the plans determine the cost of prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
Medicare spokesman Peter Ashkenaz said hotline workers are trained for at
least a week before answering calls and receive at least
two more hours a week of ongoing training. Supervisors monitor
about four calls a month for each worker. The part
of Medicare's computer program that lists the cheapest plan was
installed last week, so the worker who helped Loos had
only a few days of experience with it, at best.
</P>
<P>
Medicare hopes hotline calls will average about 10 minutes, Ashkenaz said.
</P>
<P>
Loos' call took 30 minutes.

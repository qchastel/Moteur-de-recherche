SENIORS CONFUSED ABOUT PART D MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN BERNARDINO, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Anglin, 68, takes five different medications,
none of which he can recall the names of even
though he swallows them on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
His left arm is bruised from a recent surgery that introduced
pins to his elbow and a plate to his forearm.
His ability to speak is often hampered by a stroke
that happened several years ago. And his clunky walker appears
more like a hurdle than an escort he can depend
on for mobility.
</P>
<P>
"I think the drugs I'm taking are making me an addict
rather than actually helping the problem," said Anglin, a retired
construction worker who lives in subsidized housing next to the
San Bernardino Senior Center. "And with all of these new
drug benefits, they're just gonna make things worse. I don't
know how these new benefits are going to help me."
</P>
<P>
Anglin is not alone. Scores of seniors throughout the nation are
confused about the new Medicare prescription-drug benefit known as Part
D. It's called that because the program is next in
line after Part C, another plan that essentially provides HMO
benefits to seniors.
</P>
<P>
The issue with Part D is that enrollment begins Nov. 15,
coverage starts Jan. 1, and many seniors have little knowledge
about their own prescription drug coverage, let alone a new
program that's only months away. The prognosis: Some seniors could
be paying more for their drugs without even realizing the
scope of Part D.
</P>
<P>
Only 33 percent of seniors recently surveyed by the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation felt they had enough information about the
new Medicare benefit. And only 37 percent of those interviewed
felt the drug benefit would be "very" or "somewhat" helpful.
</P>
<P>
At its core, Part D is supposed to help seniors gain
control of spiraling drug costs. But the cost of drugs
don't seem to bother a group of lunching retirees at
the San Bernardino Senior Center. Some of the seniors receive
benefits through Medicare-sponsored HMO plans.
</P>
<P>
"So I'm not going to worry about it," said Kenneth Erwin,
76, whose mailbox has been bombarded by health plans seeking
Part D business. "And why should I worry? This stuff
is so confusing and my ability to be analytical is
not the same as it used to be."
</P>
<P>
A cluster of California-based health care companies offer Part D plans
including Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, PacifiCare and others. Most of
these health plans say their members need not worry about
Part D. In fact, many seniors won't even notice a
change in their health benefits.
</P>
<P>
But for those shopping for a Part D plan, there are
several variables worth considering. All Medicare beneficiaries, no matter what
their income or marital status, are eligible for Part D
prescription drug coverage. Medicare patients can obtain the drug benefit
through two types of private plans: a prescription drug plan
(PDP), or a Medicare Advantage plan (MA), which includes HMOs
and regional PPOs.
</P>
<P>
Those who sign up for a PDP will only get drug
coverage and consequently must receive their Medicare benefits via a
fee-for-service program. The MA route will cover drugs and all
other Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
As for the cost of a Medicare drug plan, seniors will
have to pay a monthly premium that is set to
cover about 25 percent of a standard monthly premium. In
other words, patients may be billed $30 a month for
plans that cover brand-name and generic drugs. In addition to
that, participants will be charged a co-pay of about 25
percent of the drug's price. There is also a standard
$250 annual deductible, but that only covers $2,250 in drug
costs. After that's used up, beneficiaries then enter the "doughnut
hole."
</P>
<P>
The hole is a $2,850 gap in which the beneficiary has
to pay 100 percent of the price of drugs. Once
$2,850 is surpassed, Medicare kicks back in and pays 95
percent of the cost of drugs.
</P>
<P>
As confusing as the formula is, health plans are in favor
of the program. Jacklyn Kosecoff, executive vice president of specialty
companies at Cypress-based PacifiCare, deemed the Medicare overhaul as "the
greatest single change in her career."
</P>
<P>
WellPoint Health Networks also looks favorably upon Part D. The Indianapolis-based
company believes that "supporting national solutions for seniors and our
aging population is imperative to helping meet the overall immediate
and future health care needs of our country," Susan Rawlings,
president of senior services of WellPoint, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Of course, many health plans are happy with Part D because
it allows them to market a new product and the
government has agreed to foot a significant portion of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
But for lower-income individuals who are dual-eligible, meaning they qualify for
Medicaid or Medi-Cal and Medicare, Part D deserves more scrutiny
than accolades. That's because under the new benefit, lower-income seniors
could be forced to switch plans in order to continue
receiving the same prescriptions they're used to taking.
</P>
<P>
"The drug coverage they (lower-income seniors) have will not stop, although
the source will change," said Juliette Cubanski, senior policy analyst
with the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization that focuses
on health care issues. "This is why a lot of
people are on alert for what the experience might be
for the dual-eligible population."
</P>
<P>
Anglin is dual-eligible. But he has no idea what the future
holds for his health needs. A bulletin board is filled
with information about Part D at the senior center he
frequents. Incidentally, the information is sponsored by a drug company.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 42 million elderly and disabled Americans enrolled
in the Medicare program, an estimated 14.4 million will be
eligible for low-income subsidies. To qualify for those subsidies, incomes
must be below $14,355 for individuals and $20,000 for couples.
Medicare is expected to pay $4,189 of drug costs for
beneficiaries receiving low-income assistance. Low-income beneficiaries are also expected to
spend 83 percent less for their drugs once Part D
goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
But Jo Wales, coordinator of information assistance at the Long Beach
Senior Center, isn't convinced seniors will be the ones saving
money.
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be left in the dark. They're going to
be up a creek and left without a paddle," said
Wales, 71, who is enrolled in an HMO plan. "A
lot of people, especially lower-income, are used to having all
of their medication paid for. And the fact that they
might have to start paying or carrying around a formulary
of all of the plans only adds to the confusion."
</P>
<P>
Jim Anderson, a Pasadena-based spokesman for Kaiser Permanente, said his concern
is that seniors will purchase a Part D program, even
if they already have the benefit through their Medicare plan.
If a senior does purchase a Part D plan and
already has the benefit, it will immediately void their initial
coverage.
</P>
<P>
"So we're trying to let people know that we will automatically
enroll them in Part D and there is no premium
at all," Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
Despite educational efforts on behalf of health plans and nonprofit organizations,
many seniors remain apathetic. Bobbie Foster, 71, doesn't care about
Part D.
</P>
<P>
"I've heard about it. But when I get this stuff in
the mail, I just throw it in the trash," said
Foster, who carts around an oxygen tank on most days
at the San Bernardino Senior Center. "My problem is that
I just switched from UHP to Secure Horizons (another HMO)
and now I have to pay $57 a month to
get my tank filled."

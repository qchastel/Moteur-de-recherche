MILLIONS FACE DEADLINE FOR CHOOSING NEW MEDICARE PLAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deadline is approaching for elderly and disabled people who must
decide whether and when to enroll in one of the
new Medicare Part D drug plans that start Jan. 1,
2006.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Part D program for the first time brings drugs
under the Medicare tent that covers 42 million people.
</P>
<P>
The program is set up to be federally subsidized but run
by the commercial insurance industry, a combination that some say
generates confusion.
</P>
<P>
Companies are clamoring to compete, and some are adding to the
confusion by offering dozens of plans with a welter of
wrinkles and widely varying prices. Further, some insurers keep adjusting
their offerings.
</P>
<P>
But there are some basic steps to help consumers decide which
plan, if any, is right for an individual. Hari Peterson,
69, a retired nurse in Warwick, R.I., has survived the
process.
</P>
<P>
"I found it to be confusing, but we really studied it,"
said Peterson, whose husband, Ray, 72, has drug coverage from
the Department of Veterans Affairs that he plans to keep
for now.
</P>
<P>
She collected information on computer printouts from senior centers and talked
with state insurance advisers at a Medicare fair.
</P>
<P>
"I gave them my prescriptions and they pinpointed it down to
two or three plans," she said. Peterson also plans to
consult her longtime pharmacist before making a final selection.
</P>
<P>
Consumers who want coverage to start in January can make a
selection by Dec. 31, but they can also wait until
May 15 to select a plan, without penalty.
</P>
<P>
The Web site medicare.gov can answer many questions and help with
plan comparisons.
</P>
<P>
Medicare is also operating a telephone help line around the clock,
1-800-Medicare, which has an automated voice system that also allows
callers to reach a real person.
</P>
<P>
Those who decide now can still check for a better offer
next week. Through Dec. 31, consumers can change their minds.
And it may pay to keep checking, because some insurers
are continually adjusting their offerings.

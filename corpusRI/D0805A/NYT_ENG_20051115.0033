COVERAGE ENROLLMENT FOR 2006 BEGINS TODAY WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT TODAY?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the first day people on Medicare can determine their
health coverage for 2006 - whether they receive care through
Medicare's traditional Parts A and B or through a Medicare
HMO or PPO. For the first time, people on Parts
A and B also add a Part D drug benefit
to help pay their prescription bills. To get Part D
coverage, you must sign up with one of 19 private
insurance companies offering 43 different plans in Florida. Today is
the first day you can enroll in a Part D
plan or in a Medicare HMO or PPO.
</P>
<P>
When does Part D drug coverage begin?
</P>
<P>
Coverage starts Jan. 1 if you have signed up by the
end of this year. You can also sign up between
Jan. 1 and May 15, but the drug plan will
not defray your costs until you have signed up.
</P>
<P>
How do Part D drug plans work?
</P>
<P>
The company negotiates discounts from drug manufacturers and resells to you,
usually at a below-market price. You will pay a monthly
premium to the company and receive a drug plan card
to show your pharmacist when you fill prescriptions. The company
will charge you an annual deductible, if any, and copayments.
Medicare will reduce these costs by subsidizing the company for
serving you.
</P>
<P>
How much do plans cost?
</P>
<P>
Your costs will vary widely from plan to plan. Premiums in
Florida range from $10.95 to $104.89 a month, deductibles from
$0 to $250 a year. Often coverage ceases when total
drug costs hit $2,250, then begins again when total costs
hit $5,100. Copayments can range from $0 for a 30-day
generic to $75 for a brand-name drug. There is no
free lunch. Plans with broader coverage charge higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
How do HMOs fit in all this?
</P>
<P>
If you want to get your hospital and doctor care through
a Medicare HMO or PPO, it will also provide your
drug coverage, and usually more cheaply than traditional Medicare. Part
D drug plans only accompany Medicare's traditional Parts A and
B, where you pick your own doctors and hospitals. Warning:
You can't have both a Medicare HMO and a Part
D drug plan. If you sign up for both, Medicare
will disenroll you from the HMO and put you on
traditional Medicare Parts A and B. Some companies, like Humana,
Blue Cross-Blue Shield and WellCare offer both HMOs and Part
D plans so be careful what you sign up for.
</P>
<P>
I'm healthy. Must I get drug coverage?
</P>
<P>
No. Just like Part B doctor coverage, the new Part D
drug coverage is optional. However, if you reject coverage now,
Medicare will charge a penalty if you change your mind
later. Monthly premiums will rise 1 percent for each month
you reject coverage. If you have no drug coverage now,
it's probably wise to enroll in Part D. You can
join a plan for as little as $10.95 a month.
For that, you get coverage if you suddenly become sick
and you avoid premium penalties later in life, when you
are taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
What if I can't afford the premiums?
</P>
<P>
If you qualify for Medicare and already receive drugs through Medicaid
or state assistance programs, you will automatically be enrolled in
a Part D drug plan without having to pay premiums
or large copayments. As of Jan. 1, Medicaid will no
longer provide drugs to people who also qualify for Medicare.
Even if you are not on Medicaid, you might qualify
for reductions on premiums, deductibles and copayments if your income
falls below $14,356 ($19,246 for a couple) and you don't
own a lot of liquid assets such as savings, CDs
and stocks. Some income is not counted, so if you
are anywhere close to qualifying, check with Social Security toll-free
at 1-800-772-1213.
</P>
<P>
How do I sign up?
</P>
<P>
If you want to join an HMO or PPO, contact them
directly. If you want to add a Part D drug
plan to traditional Medicare Parts A and B, you can
contact the private drug plan directly or sign up online
at www.medicare.gov or by calling toll-free 1-800-MEDICARE (633-4227).
</P>
<P>
How do I pick a plan that is right for me?
</P>
<P>
The Medicare &amp; You 2006 booklet that Medicare recently sent you
lists information about drug plans and company phone numbers. The
people who answer 1-800-MEDICARE can give give a list of
the three cheapest plans based on your medications. Or you
can research that directly at www.medicare.gov. Florida's SHINE program can
give one-on-one advice if you call toll-free 1-800-963-5337. Expect to
leave a message, but a SHINE volunteer will call you
back. Information on companies is also available on www.sptimes.com/medicare.
</P>
<P>
What are the pitfalls?
</P>
<P>
If you take very many medications, be wary of picking the
plan with the lowest premium. You often can save money
by paying more for broader coverage. Make sure the company
includes your drugs on its formulary and will let you
use the pharmacy of your choice. Many plans require prior
authorization or restrict prescription quantities for some drugs. Ask each
company if they restrict your drugs and how. Consider paying
a slightly higher premium for a plan with fewer restrictions
on your specific drugs.
</P>
<P>
What if I get drug benefits from my ex-employer's or union's
retiree health plan?
</P>
<P>
Retiree plans offered by employers and unions are often cheaper than
Part D plans. You probably should keep these retiree benefits
as long as Medicare deems them "creditable coverage." If so,
you can always switch to a Medicare Part D plan
later without paying any penalty. Ask your ex-employer or union
whether your retiree plan qualifies as "creditable." If it isn't,
you probably should switch to a Medicare HMO or a
Part D drug plan to avoid paying a premium penalty
later on.
</P>
<P>
Will manufacturers still offer free drugs?
</P>
<P>
Many "patient assistance" programs for low-income people will end Jan. 1.
If you rely on one of them, contact the manufacturer
for details.

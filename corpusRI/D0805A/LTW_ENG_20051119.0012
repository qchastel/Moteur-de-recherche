Seniors Find Medicare Drug Plan Options Bewildering
</HEADLINE>

<P>
They came equipped with notepads of questions and
lists of medications, and with the thick red-white-and-blue handbook
``Medicare &amp; You.'' Nearly 200 strong, they came looking for help in
figuring out which among dozens of bewildering plans would buy them
the most medicines for the least price.
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, many left a little less confused -- but not
necessarily any closer to a decision.
</P>
<P>
``It's wearing me out,'' Betsy Curtin confessed as she and her
husband departed the James Lee Community Center near Falls Church, Va.
She sounded almost indignant about the complexity of the new Medicare
Part D Prescription Drug Coverage, the federal government's effort to
offer millions of older Americans a way to better afford their pills.
</P>
<P>
``I'm a college graduate. I worked about 20 years for the Air
Force,'' Curtin said. And she has a computer and some savvy using it.
And still, papers in hand, she grimaced. ``It's challenging.''
</P>
<P>
Just days into the launch of Medicare's biggest expansion since its
inception 40 years ago -- a program that could run taxpayers
$720billion in its first decade -- seniors and the people trying to
advise them are incredulous about the multiplicity of options,
deductibles, premiums and exceptions, which make comparisons seem
overwhelming, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
They say the same thing, whether in information sessions large and
small or in one-on-one appointments. ``It's been driving me crazy,''
said Rita Reitman Sobel of Alexandria, Va., her face betraying her
doubt and anxiety after Thursday's presentation.
</P>
<P>
What she and the rest of the audience heard was hardly reassuring.
Although Part D will greatly benefit certain people, its savings are
not universal. The annual costs of its various plans, which are being
marketed by private companies, can vary by thousands of dollars, and a
penalty could multiply many beneficiaries' bills by thousands more if
they sign up after the deadline.
</P>
<P>
And the best way to sort out the competing information? Via the
Internet -- and searches that most seniors say are beyond their ken.
Enrollment started Tuesday and continues, for those 65 and older,
until May 15. Actual coverage begins Jan.1.
</P>
<P>
The program's arcane intricacies and implementation, preceded by a
barrage of advertising, have been so criticized that some lawmakers
are pushing for a two-year delay.
</P>
<P>
``This is a bad piece of legislation, and it never should have been
enacted,'' Rep. James P. Moran Jr., D-Va., told the community center
crowd, which responded with applause.
</P>
<P>
The program is too complicated, he said, too expensive and ``too
much of a giveaway to the pharmaceutical companies.''
</P>
<P>
Yet, Moran added, ``I want to emphasize, I don't think you have a
choice. You've got to sign up for it.''
</P>
<P>
Questions and concerns took on greater urgency after enrollment
officially commenced this week. Calls to the Medicare Rights Center,
an independent, New York-based organization, quadrupled over previous
weeks' volume.
</P>
<P>
``People know the marketing materials arrived in the mail ... that
there's a benefit, but whether it's right for them is a complete
mystery to them,'' spokeswoman Deane Beebe said Friday afternoon.
``We're still trying to figure out what to tell them.''
</P>
<P>
In northern Virginia, the Fairfax Area Agency on Aging has trained
volunteers to assist local residents who walk through the door,
sometimes carrying a shoebox of pill bottles. The seniors listen
carefully but, invariably toward the end of the conversation, lean in
close and lower their voices.
</P>
<P>
``They say, `What would you do?''' program coordinator Howard
Houghton said. When the counselors explain that they can't cross that
line, their clients try a different approach: ```What would you tell
your mother to do?'''
</P>
<P>
Around computers in an Alexandria apartment complex's community
center, several seniors paired Friday with workers from the city's
Office of Aging and Adult Services and tried to make sense of the
future.
</P>
<P>
Social worker Irene Ilachinski sat with Maria Tarzi and looked over
her list of medicines. ``I don't know if there's a plan that takes all
of them,'' she said, ``but we'll see what's available at least.''
</P>
<P>
Ilachinski called up the online Medicare Prescription Drug Plan
Finder and began clicking on specific brand names: Zocor, Plavix,
Nexium and a half-dozen more. Thirty-five plans popped up.
</P>
<P>
A few feet away, MaryAnn Griffin typed in the same details and
appropriate dosages for Tarzi's cousin, Mahboub Rafik, and then hit
enter. The results: 40 possibilities, from a Humana plan with annual
costs of $3,880.66 to a plan from PacifiCare that might run $10,257.12
a year.
</P>
<P>
``Well,'' Griffin said to Rafik, ``we're not going to take that
one, are we?''

RETIREE DRUG PLANS URGE CLIENTS TO SHUN MEDICARE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louis A. deBottari, a 78-year-old retired aerospace worker with good drug
insurance, recently opened an envelope from Boeing, hoping to be
reassured.
</P>
<P>
The notice, sent to about 100,000 Boeing retirees and their dependents,
discussed the new Medicare drug insurance program that begins in
January and what it means for retirees already covered by
the company's health plan. "In general," deBottari read, "your Boeing
prescription drug coverage is more generous than standard Medicare prescription
drug coverage." So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
But a bit farther down came a warning, if deBottari was
nonetheless tempted to give the new Medicare program, called Part
D, a try: "Your Boeing prescription drug coverage is part
of your Boeing retiree medical plan. If you cancel your
Boeing prescription drug coverage, your Boeing medical coverage also will
be canceled."
</P>
<P>
Many other retirees fortunate enough to already have drug coverage are
receiving similar warnings from their former employers as the new
Medicare drug benefit approaches.
</P>
<P>
This was not necessarily what Congress intended when it passed the
Medicare law two years ago, extending drug insurance to more
than 40 million older and disabled Americans. The aim then
was to provide benefits similar to those already enjoyed by
a more fortunate minority of retirees -- about 10 million,
currently -- who have drug coverage from former employers.
</P>
<P>
In practice, though, that fortunate minority is worrying about the future
of their own benefits. And the message many are receiving
from their former employers is a surprisingly stern one: Stay
put -- or else.
</P>
<P>
The attitude may be understandable. Many employers generally offer drug benefits
within a comprehensive package that also covers doctors' services and
hospital care. They typically do not charge a separate premium
for drug coverage and do not administer it as a
separate benefit. And so they say they have no convenient
way to split up the benefits package they now offer.
</P>
<P>
There is another factor. Like other employers who continue offering drug
insurance as good or better than Medicare's, Boeing will receive
a federal subsidy for the drug purchases of each retiree
it retains. Many of those companies have shown little interest
in continuing to provide other, increasingly expensive health coverage to
a retiree if they lose the drug subsidy.
</P>
<P>
And so deBottari is staying put and trying to ignore that
big employers like General Motors are trimming their retiree health
benefits and that Wall Street analysts are predicting many other
employers will eventually scale back or even end their own
drug programs, relegating retirees to the less generous Medicare plans
they are now being advised to avoid.
</P>
<P>
By Nov. 15, all employers who offer drug coverage to retirees
and employees 65 and older are required to send word
to those beneficiaries, indicating how the company's drug plan compares
with Part D. Employers must also inform retirees of any
changes in their existing health benefits.
</P>
<P>
In a survey early this year of 458 large employers that
had retiree health plans, 82 percent said they planned to
continue drug coverage for retirees under those plans, according to
the benefits consulting firm Watson Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
During the current advisory period, many large employers that offer retiree
drug coverage -- including GM, Caterpillar, Verizon Communications, SBC Communications
and the Southern Co. -- are, like Boeing, telling their
people that the company's plan is as good or better
than the Medicare drug program.
</P>
<P>
And "more so than not, plan sponsors are saying if you
join Medicare Part D, you will be out of our
plan," said Edward Kaplan, a senior health care consultant at
the Segal Co., a benefits consulting firm. A notable exception
is GM, which is letting retirees keep their other company
health benefits, even if they sign up for Part D.
</P>

Dow Chemical, for example, is telling its people that they have
a choice to make. Low-income retirees may want the new,
special Medicare subsidies. But if they decide to go with
a Medicare plan, they cannot stay in the Dow retiree
Medicare plan, which does include drug coverage. "They cannot be
in two drug plans, under CMS rules," said Teri Ferguson,
benefits manager for Dow. Retirees at Dow can return to
the company plan in 2007, an option that isn't available
at some companies.
</P>
<P>
JP Morgan Chase, in its letter, warns retirees who choose Medicare
and lose Morgan benefits: "You may not be eligible to
reinstate this coverage following a two-year transition period."
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
Staying in a company's plan allows retirees to fend off an
often bewildering array of choices touted by insurers and other
private sponsors of Part D plans, which are overseen by
Medicare but actually provided by private industry. In some parts
of the country, older Americans may have up to 45
Medicare plans to choose among, with premiums that average $32
a month but whose coverage and co-payments vary widely.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to deal with Medicare Part D and I'm
delighted," said Marlene Barnes, 69, a retired federal office worker
in Memphis, Tenn., whose health benefits are provided by the
Federal Employees Health Plan.
</P>
<P>
People who do want to sign up for a Medicare drug
plan can do so penalty free from Nov. 15 to
May 15; there could be increasingly stiff late-fee penalties for
those who delay. But the penalties will not apply to
retirees who currently have solid employer-sponsored coverage but who shift
later to a Medicare plan -- if, say, their current
employer-sponsored plans are curtailed or ended.
</P>
<P>
The number of companies providing retiree health benefits has been shrinking
for decades, as rising costs for drugs and other health
needs have cut sharply into profits. And benefit consultants say
that many employers, after seeing how things work out with
the Medicare subsidies in 2006, will be weighing possible changes
in their retiree benefits for 2007 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Only 1 in 3 employers with 200 or more workers currently
provide retiree health benefits, down from 66 percent that offered
these benefits in the late 1980s, according to the most
recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health
Research and Educational Trust. Virtually all employers' retiree plans --
98 percent -- include a drug benefit, according to a
separate survey Kaiser conducted late last year with the benefits
consultants Hewitt Associates.
</P>
<P>
This year, even before Part D became an issue, Visteon, an
auto parts maker, said it would no longer provide health
benefits to salaried workers who retire after June 2007. Airlines
like Northwest and United have been cutting retiree benefits in
bankruptcy proceedings. Sears is eliminating retiree health benefits for younger
current employee and new hires. And in a notice to
retirees last year, Rockwell Collins, an avionics maker, said it
would no longer offer drug benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees after
2007.
</P>
<P>
Whether the new Medicare subsidies will halt the decline in retiree
benefits, as some Bush administration officials have predicted, is unclear.
</P>
<P>
J.C. Penney said it was ending drug coverage for 9,500 retirees
eligible for Medicare. Tim Lyons, a spokesman for Penney, said
it would help out during a one-year transition by paying
55 percent of the monthly premiums for an AARP plan
operated by UnitedHealth Group that covers drug costs not covered
by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
"The government will actually pay employers to continue to provide something,"
said Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on
Health, an organization of large employers. "If this works, it
may be a model for some other things in the
future."
</P>
<P>
Caterpillar, which provides retiree health benefits to more than 30,000 people,
is filing for the federal subsidy. "Although the general trend
has been to drop retiree health coverage," said Linda Fairbanks,
a Caterpillar spokeswoman, "the new federal program, with the subsidy,
will help Caterpillar and other employers continue to provide health
benefits."
</P>
<P>
The subsidies will equal 28 percent of a retiree's drug costs,
from $250 to $5,000 in 2006, whether those costs are
paid by the employer or the retiree. The Bush administration
estimates that the subsidy payments to employers will average $668
for each qualified retiree in 2006, with a maximum of
$1,330 per retiree.
</P>
<P>
Many predict that the program could be vulnerable to cost cutting.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that Medicare will spend
$71 billion on employer subsidies from 2006 to 2013, including
$5 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
Larry Boress, vice president of the Midwest Business Group on Health,
a regional employers' group, warned of possible cutbacks. "The subsidy
is a good step, but is it going to be
maintained, or reduced over time?" Boress asked. "Congress is looking
for money."
</P>
<P>
Even at the current level, the subsidy is not enough to
offset employers' rising health costs. Before GM's recent announcement of
cutbacks in benefits, the company had used its 2004 drug
costs as a model and calculated that the new Medicare
law would have reduced those costs for current and future
retiree benefits on its income statement by $603 million. That
would not be enough to wipe out the $871 million
increase in GM retiree health costs for the year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the planned overhaul of its retiree health benefits, the drug
coverage at GM will be at least as good as
standard Medicare drug benefit, according to Sharon T. Baldwin, a
company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Some big employers, including Dow Chemical and IBM, said they planned
to use part of the Medicare subsidy to reduce health
insurance premiums for retirees next year. At Dow, the monthly
premium for its most popular retiree health plan -- now
about $49 for someone who worked a full career at
the company -- would have increased to $57 next year,
according to Ferguson, Dow's benefits manager. Dow's benefit plans cover
38,000 retirees and dependents on Medicare as well as 21,500
active employees in the United States. Thanks to the subsidy,
Ferguson said, that monthly premium will be approximately $35.
</P>
<P>
Kaplan at Segal said that nearly two-thirds of his company's clients
were taking the Medicare subsidy. "But they are wrestling with
the strategy," he said: "'Should we continue to protect our
members' against health care expenses? What is our commitment to
them? Can we afford to do it?"'
</P>
<P>
Some small employers that still provide retiree drug benefits say the
Medicare subsidy may not be worth the trouble, at least
for the first year. The town government of Normal, Ill.,
with only 20 eligible retirees and spouses, found that costs
for consultants and preparing paperwork to apply for the subsidy
would outweigh the $6,000 that Normal could expect from Medicare,
said Pamela Reece, a town official.
</P>
<P>
Instead of applying for the subsidy, Normal intends to continue its
current health plans and offer extra coverage to fill in
the gaps in Part D plans for retirees who decide
to join a plan operated by an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
In other cases, the current benefits provided by smaller employers may
not meet the minimum Medicare standards. "Many of our cooperatives
might not qualify for the subsidy," said Scott M. Spencer,
senior vice president of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.
Spencer's group is offering its own Part D drug plan
in 47 states.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, few of those 10 million retirees whose coveted drug benefits
the new Medicare program was meant to emulate, are feeling
secure.
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried," said deBottari, the aerospace retiree.

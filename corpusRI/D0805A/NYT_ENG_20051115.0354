SENIORS LOOKING FOR ADVICE ON MEDICARE DRUG COVERAGE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SACRAMENTO, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Enrollment in Medicare's new drug coverage started Tuesday,
and seniors are clamoring for advice on how to navigate
a crucial program that offers more than 50 options.
</P>
<P>
Joan Parks, director of Sacramento's Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program,
or HICAP, said her office is getting more than 200
phone messages a day -- far more than the staff
of eight can quickly return.
</P>
<P>
"We're just deluged," said Parks, whose program provides free, unbiased consumer
advice. "But I refuse to sink."
</P>
<P>
Medicare's new drug coverage, called Part D, goes into effect Jan.
1. During this initial enrollment, the state's 4.3 million beneficiaries
have until May 15 to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
A HICAP-sponsored information session Tuesday at the Elk Grove Senior Center
drew an audience of 85. Questions, and concerns, were plentiful.
</P>
<P>
"I take about 20 medications, and half of them are extremely
expensive, so I am really worried about this," Helen Casillas,
64, of Elk Grove told the counselors.
</P>
<P>
Later, the retired Realtor said, "I am terrified by it. One
of my drugs alone is $200, and others are nearly
that high."
</P>
<P>
In addition to presentations to senior groups across the region, HICAP's
staff and 40 trained volunteers provide one-on-one counseling. But seniors
and the disabled may have to be patient.
</P>
<P>
Because of the number of calls, Parks said, it may take
her staff five days to return calls. Some are calling
more than once when they don't get a return call
the same day, adding to the volume.
</P>
<P>
"We're doing our best to meet that need," Parks said. "They
may get a voicemail."
</P>
<P>
She said people should call once and "know we will call
them back."
</P>
<P>
Parks said HICAP isn't taking on new volunteers at this time
because she doesn't have the staff or time needed to
train them on the complicated new coverage.
</P>
<P>
She encouraged Medicare beneficiaries to attend a community presentation to learn
the basics.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of resources at those events and they're constantly
bringing in the new information," Parks said.
</P>
<P>
Casillas said she attended Tuesday's Elk Grove session because she is
having trouble getting her questions answered.
</P>
<P>
"The worst part is that the people in charge are just
learning it," she said. "They know very little. I've been
calling them for a while."
</P>
<P>
Medicare officials are encouraging people to call the (800)MEDICARE telephone assistance
line or go online to get enrollment information. The challenge
is for beneficiaries to figure out which of the 47
stand-alone drug plans or seven Medicare managed-care health plans available
in Sacramento is right for them.
</P>
<P>
Jack Cheevers, spokesman for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services in San Francisco, said there has been a "robust"
use of Medicare's Web site at www.medicare.gov, which offers details
of the plans.
</P>
<P>
But Parks said many of those seeking advice are older people
without computer access or skills to use Internet search tools
to compare plans. They may not have family or friends
to turn to for help.
</P>
<P>
HICAP receptionist Denise King said some seniors have complained to her
they are put on hold or transferred when they call
Medicare, and do not get their questions answered.
</P>
<P>
There's a wait for one-on-one HICAP counseling appointments. While some feel
rushed to make a choice, others may wait until the
last minute.
</P>
<P>
Michael Negrete, an official with the California Pharmacists Association, spoke at
a community event Monday night to residents of a gated
mobile-home park. Only 20 of the 200 residents invited actually
attended, he said.
</P>
<P>
Negrete said pharmacists are learning about the coverage to be prepared
to help customers.
</P>
<P>
His best advice to consumers is get a good understanding of
the coverage you have now, make a list of all
medications now needed and decide which pharmacy you'd like to
use.
</P>
<P>
Beneficiaries who get traditional fee-for-service Medicare may want to consider one
of the 47 stand-alone prescription drug plans offered statewide.
</P>
<P>
Others who now are enrolled in a Medicare managed-care plan may
consider signing up for an enhanced package with that insurer
that will include prescription drug coverage, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many retirees may want to stay with their current prescription drug
coverage through a former employer's health plan if it is
comparable to what's offered through Medicare.

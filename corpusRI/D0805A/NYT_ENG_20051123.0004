Six counselors toting laptop computers will begin scouring
the Twin Cities in a van in search of Medicare
beneficiaries who need help signing up for the new drug
benefit, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be a lot more effective helping people who need a
hand figuring out this new benefit -- people whose health
and finances may improve significantly because of help paying for
their drugs," said Janine Stiles of the Minnesota Senior Federation.
</P>
<P>
The new cadre of counselors also may help ease pressure on
the statewide Minnesota Linkage Line, which is wrestling with a
backlog of more than 1,000 calls for help enrolling in
the Medicare drug program.
</P>
<P>
Counselors will work with the Minnesota Access to Benefits Coalition, which
Stiles coordinates.
</P>
<P>
The coalition has been in the field for a year helping
educate older and disabled beneficiaries about the Medicare drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
In about two weeks, the counselors will start showing up at
already scheduled informational sessions about the drug benefit and will
visit other sites. They will help beneficiaries sort through more
than 60 private plans offering drug insurance. The benefit will
start Jan. 1 for those who enroll by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
The local effort is part of a national campaign and funded
by a $10 million grant from British drugmaker AstraZeneca to
the National Council on the Aging.
</P>
<P>
The council organized the national Access to Benefits Coalition last year.
This year it is financed largely by a $2 million
grant from the drug manufacturers trade association.
</P>
<P>
NEW ONLINE HELP
</P>
<P>
In its announcement Tuesday, the council also unveiled a streamlined Web
site -- www.MyMedicareMatters.org -- to help Medicare beneficiaries and their
families learn about the drug benefit and plug into the
enrollment process.
</P>
<P>
The new computer site, financed in part by the federal government,
supplements the Medicare Web site that some older people have
complained is cumbersome and at times is slow because of
heavy Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
Demand on the Medicare Web site was so heavy Tuesday that
its enrollment tool was unavailable for much of the day,
officials at the Minnesota Linkage Line said.
</P>
<P>
THANKSGIVING CONVERSATIONS
</P>
<P>
Medicare officials have not released any information about how many people
have joined a Medicare drug-insurance plan since enrollment started Nov.
15.
</P>
<P>
"My hunch is we'll know more -- maybe even get a
big push in enrollments -- after families talk about the
drug benefit over their Thanksgiving dinner," said Peter Ashkenaz ,
a spokesman for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services.
</P>
<P>
Medicare program administrator Mark McClellan urged families Tuesday to have those
conversations.
</P>
<P>
"We'll do as much outreach as we can," he said. "This
new initiative with counselors and computers will help. But the
best outreach will come from families, talking it over with
their parents and aunts and uncles."

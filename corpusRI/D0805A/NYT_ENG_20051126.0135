EDITORIAL: A ROCKY ROLLOUT FOR MEDICARE PART D

The government's celebrated new prescription drug program for senior
citizens got off to a rocky start this month, with
elderly consumers fuming over its complexity and federal websites crashing
under heavy traffic. But perhaps the worst news came last
Tuesday, when Rep. Henry Waxman released a report showing that
a typical senior citizen could get a better deal at
Costco or Drugstore.com than in the elaborate new Medicare marketplace.

It's too late now to change the law, which passed Congress
in 2003, and too soon to rewrite it. But it's
not premature to study whether it's really serving the interests
of Medicare beneficiaries and the taxpayers who will pay its
massive cost.
</P>
<P>
Waxman, a California Democrat, asked congressional investigators to study the 10
top-selling drugs among senior citizens, and then compare prices available
at popular discounters against prices in the new Medicare Part
D, which relies on private insurance companies to deliver coverage.
They found that, on average, drug prices in the new
Medicare were about 3 percent higher than prices available to
any customer at Costco or Drugstore.com and 60 percent higher
than prices in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Given the enormous sums that Congress poured into the Medicare subsidy,
that's bizarre.
</P>
<P>
To be sure, this is not the last word on Medicare
Part D. Some elderly consumers, buying some medications, probably will
find better prices through Medicare plans. And it's worth remembering
that congressional skeptics were wrong before: A year ago they
predicted that insurance companies would balk at entering the Medicare
market, but today there are dozens with Medicare drug offerings.
It's only fair to give this big, complicated new system
a year or so to prove itself.
</P>
<P>
That said, congressional Republicans who promised that competition among private insurance
companies would improve Medicare, delivering low prices for consumers and
low costs for taxpayers, now bear a heavy burden of
proof. The Veterans Administration, for example, doesn't operate that way.
It simply negotiates bulk discounts with drugmakers and pays far
less than retail. So does Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program
for the poor. And yet the 2003 law that created
Part D specifically forbids Medicare to negotiate the same sort
of bulk discounts.
</P>
<P>
The theory of market competition is powerful, but it shouldn't be
taken as gospel. As economist Paul Krugman has argued, private
markets might be the best way to produce cars and
computers, but are a horrible way to deliver health care.
The United States relies on private markets to deliver health
care far more than any other developed nation, and yet
Americans pay far more for health care than consumers in
other advanced nations.
</P>
<P>
If the new Medicare Part D turns out to be expensive
but wonderful, it might be worth it. If it turns
out to be inexpensive but complicated, that also might be
acceptable. But if it turns out to be complicated and
wasteful too, Americans will find it's time to go back
to the drawing board on health care.

MEDICARE PLAN OFFERS A LOT TO FIGURE OUT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>

<P>
Reuben and Claudia Beck understand complex things.
</P>
<P>
Reuben, 84, who was a sailor in World War II and
an engineer for 40 years, designed conveyor systems for automobiles
before retiring at age 70. Claudia, 66, a registered nurse,
is a retired insurance claims adjuster who knows how to
slash through red tape.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Becks fear they have met their match in
Medicare's new prescription drug benefit plan, designed to help seniors
pay for medicine.
</P>
<P>
"It's just so confusing," Claudia Beck said. "And it seems the
more I call, the more runaround I get."
</P>
<P>
The couple, along with 42 million other seniors and disabled citizens
eligible for Medicare, will have access to a benefit that
seniors have wanted for a long time.
</P>
<P>
And there's no doubt the prescription drug program will help millions.
</P>
<P>
First, however, they must survive the jungle of jargon and confusing
array of options that are tripping up thousands already --
and the benefit hasn't even started yet.
</P>
<P>
Medicare is the government program that provides health insurance for Americans
65 and older. It has not previously covered outpatient prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
But in 2003, Congress passed a law that will make prescription
drug coverage available to those on Medicare starting Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
Private insurers are providing the coverage. Those eligible for the benefit
can pick an insurance plan from dozens being marketed to
them. Seniors generally will pay premiums and co-payments as with
most insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
But the confusion begins right at the beginning -- when seniors
try to pick a plan. In Georgia, there are 82
plans offered by 18 companies.
</P>
<P>
Deductibles, co-payments, out-of-pocket expenses and covered drugs vary among the plans.
Imagine 82 plans with, say, five variables -- premium, deductible,
co-payments, drug list and pharmacy choice. The variables become mathematically
if not emotionally daunting.
</P>
<P>
"The new Medicare drug benefit is 10 times more complicated than
the Medicare drug discount card," said Robert Hayes, president of
the Medicare Rights Center, a New York-based consumer advocacy organization,
"and 10 times more important."
</P>
<P>
Even after comparing premiums, co-payments, deductibles and rosters of drugs, the
work will still not be complete. Seniors will also need
to determine how they'll stomach what's termed "the doughnut hole"
-- a gap where there's no coverage after seniors rack
up drug costs of $2,250.
</P>
<P>
Under most drug plans, patients will have coverage up to $2,250
in spending. But between $2,250 and $5,100, they'll generally be
on their own. Medicare will pay 95 percent of covered
drug costs above $5,100.
</P>
<P>
Worth looking into
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, it's worthwhile for seniors to explore the new
$700 billion benefit, especially those with limited incomes, those who
lack drug coverage now and those with high prescription costs,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The best way for seniors to compare plans is by using
Medicare's Web site or calling Medicare or a local insurance
counseling service to use the Internet tool for them.
</P>
<P>
Gary Karr, a spokesman for the federal agency that runs Medicare,
acknowledged "a little bit of anxiety" among consumers over the
benefit. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also
emphasized there's no immediate rush to sign up, that Nov.
15 is just the starting point.
</P>
<P>
"People do have time to take a deep breath," said Dr.
Mark McClellan, the Medicare agency's administrator. "They don't need to
rush into a decision."
</P>
<P>
Enrollment is open between Nov. 15 and May 15. Coverage for
those who enroll before Dec. 31 will begin Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
If you wait until after May 15 to enroll, you might
have to pay extra to join a plan.
</P>
<P>
The Medicare agency said seniors now can narrow down their choices
based on what's important to them -- premium, deductible, available
drugs, or other factors.
</P>
<P>
McClellan said CMS had added thousands of customer service representatives, and
that during a recent week handled more than 700,000 calls
"with no or minimal delay."
</P>
<P>
The competition among drug plans has helped consumers, he said. "What
we're seeing is that drug plans are coming in at
a lower cost and with better benefits than were expected."
Some plans have no doughnut hole or no deductible, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This benefit is really worth it," McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
Can't call everybody
</P>
<P>
The Becks have struggled to find information about the 82 drug
plans and analyze which one might work best for them.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Medicare pamphlet about the program could not list
all the provisions of the 82 plans listed in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
"Am I going to have to call all 82 companies?" Claudia
Beck asked one day last week.
</P>
<P>
And the Becks wonder: If figuring out a prescription drug plan
is this hard for them, how hard will it be
for millions of others not as savvy or healthy?
</P>
<P>
Such insecurity among seniors appears to be widespread, according to Lisa
Federico, coordinator of GeorgiaCares, a nonprofit insurance counseling service. Her
office is receiving about 300 calls a day from seniors
frantic for help. The staff can process about 80 of
them, she said, creating a pileup of 220 calls a
day and putting them at least a week behind.
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like this, just the level of confusion
this is generating," Federico said.
</P>
<P>
After some delays, the Medicare Web site (www.medicare.gov) for the drug
benefit has finally opened, but still isn't fully functional, with
a key piece of the "Prescription Drug Plan Finder" tool
not working. It frustrates counselors trying to help seniors. The
Medicare agency said the site would be completely functioning "in
the next few days."
</P>
<P>
Even then, for many reasons, seniors will need insurance counseling, Hayes
said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be insurers who will promote a low premium and
disguise the extremely high co-payments," Hayes said. A senior can
find out what drugs are covered on a plan's formulary,
he said, "but people aren't being told how much they
are going to pay" for the drugs.
</P>
<P>
State government retiree Robert Hauss, 75, said he feels a time
crunch on his drug plan decision.
</P>
<P>
State retirees were told they must make a decision about keeping
their current state drug plan by Tuesday, but Hauss said
he didn't get his booklet from the state detailing the
changes until Oct. 27. Other state retirees have also complained
to GeorgiaCares about a tight deadline for the state plan.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Gov. Sonny Perdue announced that he was extending the
state's enrollment deadline 10 days, to Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
Hauss, meanwhile, said his retiree health plan will be about twice
as expensive as its current cost if he doesn't join
a Medicare drug plan. "The state is forcing us to
go into Medicare Part D," he said. "I'm not happy
with the changes."
</P>
<P>
But a spokeswoman for the state agency overseeing the retiree plan
denied the state was pushing people into Medicare drug coverage.
"They have choices," said Julie Kerlin, spokeswoman for the Georgia
Department of Community Health. "Employees make choices every time there
is an open enrollment."
</P>
<P>
Hauss takes seven medications for chronic conditions, and worries that not
all his drugs will be covered as they are now.
"Medicare Part D plans may not have the same drug
formulary as the state health plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hauss isn't hooked into the Internet, so he's waiting for insurance
counselors to call back.
</P>
<P>
Frustration is high
</P>
<P>
Jim and Marlys Antonoff have spent hours compiling information on Medicare's
drug benefit. They've neatly filed brochures and information from seven
drug plans in a plastic container. They've called the insurance
companies -- even politicians -- seeking answers.
</P>
<P>
Despite the painstaking work they have done to understand Part D,
they're still frustrated by its complexity.
</P>
<P>
And they find themselves chuckling about the string of roadblocks they
run into.
</P>
<P>
One roadblock: Three drug plans' phone numbers listed in the Medicare
handbook are wrong, said Jim Antonoff.
</P>
<P>
Jim, 79, said he called an insurance company and asked, "Can
you expedite the information to me?" And the company's representative
replied, "What's 'expedite'?"
</P>
<P>
"The average person is going to have a terrible time with
this," Jim said as they finally navigated the Medicare Web
site.
</P>
<P>
There are things that the Antonoffs like about the new plan.
</P>
<P>
It's an insurance policy against unforeseen drug costs that can run
into the thousands of dollars, Jim said.
</P>
<P>
Jim could save about $1,000 from the new benefit. And his
current out-of-pocket drug costs, with no prescription coverage, reach about
$5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
Marlys, 67, could also save about $1,000.
</P>
<P>
Still, Jim Antonoff said he thought Part D could have been
designed much better.
</P>
<P>
"The average person is going to be so lost, they're going
to throw up their arms and say, 'The hell with
it,' " Antonoff said.

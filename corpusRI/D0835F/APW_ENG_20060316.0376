Prompted by an upcoming book about Barry Bonds, an anti-doping U.S. congressman
wrote a letter on Wednesday asking Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig
about his role in policing steroid use from 1998-02.
</P>
<P>
"As commissioner, you have the essential responsibility to safeguard the
integrity of the game and to ensure that cheaters have no place in professional
baseball," Cliff Stearns said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Stearns' House Energy and Commerce subcommittee held hearings last year about
steroid use and he introduced the Drug Free Sports Act, one of several bills
that would have made U.S. sports leagues give players lifetime bans for a second
or third doping offense.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from Congress, MLB's players association agreed to toughen drug
testing rules and penalties for 2005 and again this season.
</P>
<P>
Stearns asked Selig for information about a 2004 meeting with Bonds, MLB's
policy for addressing alleged steroid use if a player doesn't fail a drug test,
and what Selig's authority is to investigate alleged steroid
use.
</P>
<P>
Bonds, who broke Mark McGwire's season homer record in 2001 and is approaching
Babe Ruth's career total, is accused in an upcoming book of using steroids,
human growth hormone and insulin for at least five seasons beginning in 1998.
MLB did not ban performance-enhancing substances until after the 2002
season.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Selig wouldn't commit to investigating. He said MLB will await
publication of the book, "Game of Shadows," which is due out March 23, then
decide how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
The New York Daily News, however, reported Thursday that Selig has already
decided to begin an investigation, according to an unidentified baseball
official. The newspaper said Selig is expected to announce the decision next
week, but hadn't yet decided if the investigation will be done by Major League
Baseball officials or outside investigators.

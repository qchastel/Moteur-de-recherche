The chairman of a Congressional panel looking into steroid use in Major League
Baseball chided the sport's leaders Thursday for being uncooperative and urged
star players subpoenaed his hearing to "take public responsibility" for their
actions.

<P>
The U.S. government has stepped in to investigate steroid use among professional
baseball players use because it felt the sport wasn't doing enough to enforce
its own policies.
</P>
<P>
The Government Reform Committee was hearing from six subpoenaed players,
including Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, along with commissioner Bud Selig and
other baseball executives, medical experts and the parents of two amateur
athletes who committed suicide after taking steroids.
</P>
<P>
"Major League Baseball and the players' association greeted word of our inquiry
first as a nuisance, then as a negotiation, replete with misstatements,"
committee chairman Tom Davis said in his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
"I understand their desire to avoid the public's prying eye. ... But I think
they misjudged our seriousness of purpose," he said. "I think they misjudged the
will of an American public who believes that sunshine is the best
disinfectant."
</P>
<P>
Selig sat with arms crossed and lips pursed as Davis and ranking minority member
Henry Waxman chastised him and his sport.
</P>
<P>
"There is a pyramid of steroid use in society and today our investigation starts
where it should _ with the owners and players at the top of that pyramid,"
Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
Without immunity from prosecution, some players were thought to be considering
invoking their Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the players, Davis said some "have an opportunity today to either
clear their name or take public responsibility for their action, and perhaps
offer cautionary tales to our youth."

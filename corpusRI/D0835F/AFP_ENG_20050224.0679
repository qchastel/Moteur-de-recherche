<P>
Democratic lawmaker Henry Waxman of 
California asked Thursday that former baseball star Jose Canseco 
appear at congressional hearings to talk about the steroid scandal.
</P>
<P>
Waxman would also like to call Canseco's former teammate Mark 
McGwire and force them to testify under oath about the culture of 
performance-enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball (MLB).
</P>
<P>
"Jose Canseco's allegations about steroid use by Mark McGwire 
and other baseball players have received enormous media attention. 
Many of the individuals have denied the accusations. Mr Canseco 
insists his information is accurate," Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a simple way to find the truth in this matter. Our 
committee should hold a hearing with Mr Canseco, Mr McGwire and 
others and have them testify under oath.
</P>
<P>
"This would be an opportunity to find out what really happened 
and to get to the bottom of this growing scandal."
</P>
<P>
In his controversial new book, "Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 
'Roids, Smash Hits and How Baseball Got Big," Canseco said he 
injected steroids into some of the baseball's biggest stars, 
including home run legend McGwire and New York Yankees superstar 
Jason Giambi.
</P>
<P>
The players have vehemently denied ever using 
performance-enhancing steroids. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Tom Davis, chairman of the House Government 
Reform Committee, Waxman said he also wants MLB officials to explain 
what measures they are taking to deal with the steroids.
</P>
<P>
"We should also hear from representatives from Major League 
Baseball and the players' union to examine what they plan to do to 
stop the use of dangerous drugs by pro baseball players.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the baseball commissioner's statement that his goal is 
to have zero tolerance regarding steroids, Major League Baseball has 
announced it will not investigate Mr. Canseco's allegations."
</P>
<P>
Baseball has been trying in the last few months to toughen its 
penalties for steroid use but critics say the new laws lag behind 
other sports.
</P>
<P>
A first positive test would now result in a suspension of up to 
10 days, a second positive test a 30-day ban, a third positive a 
60-day penalty.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous agreement, a first positive test resulted 
only in treatment.
</P>
<P>
In the Olympics the first penalty is a two-year ban.
</P>
<P>
Waxman said the steroid issue not only threatens the health of 
professional players but also youths who feel the only way to be 
successful in the sport is to take steroids.

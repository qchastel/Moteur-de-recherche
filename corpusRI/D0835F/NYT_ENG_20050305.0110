COMMENTARY: STAMPING OUT STEROIDS TAKES TIME
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commissioner Bud Selig and Major League Baseball have taken a lot
of heat over the last several months for their supposed
failure to grapple forthrightly with the sport's steroid problem. Some
have even suggested that people in the commissioner's office have
been winking at one another while they make public pronouncements
against steroid use.
</P>
<P>
From my perspective, these critics are jumping to unfair conclusions. They
would benefit from taking a step back and looking more
carefully at the evolution of the steroid problem in baseball.
Before the mid-1990s, the substances of choice in the clubhouse
were amphetamines and recreational drugs. The prevailing view was that
top offensive performances in baseball demanded quick reflexes, good eye-hand
coordination, quick feet, flexibility and strong wrists -- not bulky
muscles.
</P>
<P>
An FBI special agent, Greg Stejskal, told the news media last
month that he had notified Major League Baseball about 10
years ago that steroid use was a developing problem. Indeed,
it was probably around 10 years ago that some people
in baseball became aware that anabolic steroids were being used
by some players. At the time, many anabolic steroids were
illegal if purchased without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
But as baseball became more aware of this as a growing
issue, the commissioner's office did, in fact, act.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Selig convened a group at his Milwaukee office, including
team physicians, trainers and outside medical experts, and they decided
to begin an investigation and to gather as much information
about steroid use and its effects as possible.
</P>
<P>
The next year, together with the players union, baseball helped finance
a study on androstenedione. It turned out to be the
seminal study on the substance and was later published in
a leading medical journal.
</P>
<P>
In June 2001, Major League Baseball published a pamphlet in English
and in Spanish and distributed it to major league and
minor league players. It laid out in considerable detail the
known effects of various classes of performance-enhancing drugs. It also
hired a new medical staff to advise it on drug
policy.
</P>
<P>
Baseball reasoned that if it could get players to the majors
clean, then it had won half the battle. In the
same year, it decided to put in a stringent testing
and penalty program for the minor leagues. Incidentally, it wasn't
until May 2002 that Ken Caminiti, in an interview with
Sports Illustrated, estimated that half of major leaguers were using
steroids.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, baseball and the union agreed to their first steroid
testing and penalty program. Earlier this year it was agreed
-- in the middle of a collective bargaining agreement --
to extend that program significantly.
</P>
<P>
It would be easy to go back and identify instances when
baseball might have gotten the message sooner. It would be
equally easy to argue that baseball might have acted sooner
or more punitively. It is a safe bet that today
Selig and others wish they had done more earlier. Indeed,
the new testing and penalty protocol is far from perfect.
</P>
<P>
But it is also proper to remember that baseball was hampered
by the confidentiality of doctor-patient relationships, the sanctity of the
clubhouse culture and union concerns about privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
The dimensions and the implications of the drug issue in professional
sports are just beginning to be understood. One must understand
the scope of the problem before one can devise effective
policy. Eradicating drug abuse is no simple matter. New chemical
compounds and new delivery methods (making detection much more difficult)
are being developed every day.
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the intractability of the problem is the fact that most
athletes under investigation in the BALCO scandal are Olympians, and
that the International Olympic Committee is reputed to have the
gold standard in anti-doping policies. Down the road, gene-modification therapy
will further complicate the landscape.
</P>
<P>
Major League Baseball must be patient and tenacious if it is
to have success in the long-run fight against performance-enhancing drugs.
Fans, too, need patience.

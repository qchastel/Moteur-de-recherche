Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig asked players to agree to a 50-game
suspension for first-time steroid offenders and a lifetime ban for a third
violation under what he called a "three strikes and you are out approach" to
doping.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent this week to players union head Donald Fehr, Selig proposed a
100-game ban for a second offense. He also asked the union to ban amphetamines,
to have more frequent random tests and to appoint an independent person to
administer the MLB drug-testing program.
</P>
<P>
"Third offenders should be banned permanently. I recognize the need for
progressive discipline, but a third-time offender has no place in the game,"
Selig wrote to Fehr. "Steroid users cheat the game. After three offenses, they
have no place in it."
</P>
<P>
Under the rules that began this season, a first offense gets a 10-day
suspension, with the penalty increasing to 30 days for a second positive test,
60 days for a third and one year for a fourth. For a fifth positive, the penalty
is at the commissioner's discretion.
</P>
<P>
MLB has no penalties for amphetamine use by players on major-league rosters, but
are banned for players under minor league contracts.
</P>
<P>
Reached Saturday, Fehr said the union was not yet prepared to discuss Selig's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
"We'll respond in due course," Fehr said, adding he anticipated replying early
next week.
</P>
<P>
The proposal comes six weeks after several officials, players and former players
testified before the U.S. Congress regarding MLB's doping policy following
revelations by some and accusations of widespread steroid use within the
league.
</P>
<P>
Among those accused is San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry Bonds, who broke
the single-season home run record in 2001 and is closing on career leaders Hank
Aaron and Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
According to published reports, Bonds told a federal grand jury he unknowingly
used a steroid cream provided by the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, which is
at the center of a government investigation that also has implicated 100-meter
world record holder Tim Montgomery and Olympic champion Marion
Jones.

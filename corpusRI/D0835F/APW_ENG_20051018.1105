BALCO head Victor Conte was sentenced to eight months on Tuesday as part of a
plea deal for his role as mastermind behind a scheme to provide professional
athletes with undetectable performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Conte, who will spend four months in prison and four months in home confinement,
started the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative. The lab, according to court
records, counted dozens of prominent athletes among its clients, including
Olympic track champion Marion Jones, major league baseball's Barry Bonds and
Jason Giambi, and others.

<P>
James Valente, BALCO's vice president, was sentenced to probation after pleading
guilty to reduced charges of steroid distribution. Greg Anderson, Bonds'
trainer, was sentenced to six months after pleading guilty to money laundering
and a steroid distribution charge. He must spend three months behind bars and
three months in home confinement.
</P>
<P>
The case prompted U.S. pro sports to stiffen anti-doping policies and thrust
performance-enhancing drugs into the spotlight. THG, a once-unknown steroid
discovered in the investigation, is now banned throughout sports.
</P>
<P>
Conte pleaded guilty in July to money laundering and a steroid distribution
charge; dozens of counts were dropped. Anderson and Conte remain free on bond
and are scheduled to surrender to prison authorities on Dec.
1.

<P>
U.S. Attorney Kevin Ryan in San Francisco has said the plea deals were spurred
in part by weak steroid laws and by the fact that some of the chemicals were not
banned at the time.
</P>
<P>
Track coach Remi Korchemny is expected to get probation at a later sentencing
date.
</P>
<P>
Still, authorities are now taking aim at the alleged BALCO suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the authorities raided a laboratory in Champaign, Illinois headed by
Patrick Arnold, who's known for introducing the steroid precursor
androstenedione to the U.S. Andro came to public attention in 1998 when St.
Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire said he used it when breaking MLB's home
run record.

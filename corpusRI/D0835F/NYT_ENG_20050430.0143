COMMISSIONER WANTS HARSHER PENALTIES FOR STEROID USE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter to the players' union, baseball commissioner Bud Selig
has admitted that the newly revised steroid policy is not
enough.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner is proposing suspending players for nearly one-third of a
season for a first offense.
</P>
<P>
Selig will no longer applaud or take pains to defend the
current steroid policy, as he so fervently attempted during a
contentious, 11-hour congressional hearing in March.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his letter to players' union boss Donald Fehr last week,
Selig said he wants to abolish the taint that the
steroid controversy has brought to the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
Instead of the current 10-game suspension for first offenders, Selig proposes
a 50-game suspension in a 162-game season. Instead of the
current 30-game suspension for second-time offenders, Selig wants the penalty
increased to 100 games.
</P>
<P>
Instead of a 60-day suspension for third-time offenders, Selig wants a
lifetime ban. Three strikes, and a player is out.
</P>
<P>
Under the current policy, players don't receive a lifetime ban until
a fifth offense.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever would be stupid enough to get caught once would surely
stop under this new proposal," said Colorado Rockies pitcher Jason
Jennings. "Fifty games, that's a big hit. It would definitely
be a deterrent."
</P>
<P>
Selig also requested that amphetamines be added to the list of
banned substances that includes steroids, steroid precursors, masking agents, ephedrine,
Androstenedione and human growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to let the letter speak for itself and make
no further comment," said Rob Manfred, Major League Baseball's top
labor lawyer and the man who oversees the drug policy.
</P>
<P>
Manfred did say Selig's proposals would become part of the minor-league
steroid policy next season. Minor leaguers not on 40-man, big-league
rosters are not protected by the Players' Association.
</P>
<P>
As for getting his proposal to fly with the players, Selig
may count on escalating pressure from the public and the
House Government Reform Committee that chastised baseball officials at a
March 17 hearing. It has threatened to institute an independent,
all-sports drug-testing system unless baseball strengthens its policy.
</P>
<P>
"I have grave concerns about the damage that has been done
to Major League Baseball by players' use of performance-enhancing substances,"
Selig wrote to Fehr. "The use of such substances ...
(present) a fundamental challenge to the integrity of the game."
</P>
<P>
The players union is expected to balk at the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Among the concerns that have been raised since baseball began formal
drug testing last season is the realization that several steroid
agents stay in a person's blood stream for six months
or longer.
</P>
<P>
This would present the possibility that even if a player swore
off steroids after using them once, he still could eventually
face a lifetime ban if regularly tested under Selig's proposal.
</P>
<P>
The players also may argue that they made the unprecedented move
of re-opening the collective bargaining agreement in January to strengthen
the steroid proposal. In the initial steroid policy implemented last
season, first offenders were not punished and players were tested
just once. The policy was revised this season to subject
players to unlimited testing and to punish first offenders.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders are expected to argue that implementing even harsher penalties
before the new one is two months old would leave
the players worried that no matter what they do, it
would never be enough.
</P>
<P>
"I thought we already negotiated this," said Rockies star Todd Helton.
"I don't think we ought to negotiate things because the
press wants us to."
</P>
<P>
The collective bargaining agreement doesn't expire until after the 2006 season.
</P>
<P>
The players also could argue that early indications of the current
drug-testing policy is it's the best among the four major
sports. The NFL has been testing for steroids for 15
years and has suspended 54 active players, an average of
3.6 per year. Baseball's revised steroid testing program has suspended
four players in two months.
</P>
<P>
Although steroid use is believed rampant in many sports, baseball has
taken the brunt of the controversy, in part because many
past and present star sluggers -- including Barry Bonds, Mark
McGwire, Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield -- have been linked
to use of the illegal substance.
</P>
<P>
McGwire set the single-season home run record with 70 in 1998,
and Bonds broke it three years later with 73.
</P>
<P>
"Congress is so adamant about cleaning up steroids in baseball, they
ought to clean up some of the stuff they're doing,"
said Rockies outfielder Dustan Mohr. "I don't think all of
them are saints either."

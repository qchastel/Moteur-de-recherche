NEW YORK, Nov 15 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Francisco's Barry Bonds, whose Major League Baseball feats have
been dogged by unproven steroid suspicions, became the oldest player
to win the National League Most Valuable Player award on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old slugger, poised to challenge the all-time home run
record, won the award for the fourth year in a row and seventh time
overall. Willie Stargell was the previous oldest to win the award,
doing so in 1979 at age 39.
</P>
<P>
Bonds, who hit his 700th career homer in September, received 24 of 32
first-place votes and 407 points overall in balloting by writers to
claim his fourth consecutive league MVP honor.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre was second, 96 points
back with six first-place votes, and St. Louis slugger Albert Pujols
was third with one first-place vote and 247 points.
</P>
<P>
Bonds testified before a grand jury looking into the BALCO steroid
scandal and his personal trainer, Greg Anderson, was among four men
charged in the case. Bonds had steadfastly denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Major League Baseball did not institute a full steroid-testing
program until this season, but a steroid previously undetectable by
testing was at the heart of the BALCO case.
</P>
<P>
With 703 career homers, Bonds trails only Hank Aaron's record 755 and
Babe Ruth's 714 on the all-time homers list.
</P>
<P>
Bonds, fourth in homers with 45, led the NL in batting (.362),
on-base percentage (.609) and was second in runs scored with 129.
</P>
<P>
Bonds set a major league record with 232 walks, more than 100 more
than the next closest player. His 120 intentional walks were 52
beyond the old record.

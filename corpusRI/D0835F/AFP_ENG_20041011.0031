</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Major League Baseball all-star Ken Caminiti, who admitted
taking steroids to boost his playing career, died of a heart attack
on Sunday. He was 41.
</P>
<P>
The ex-MVP of the National League in 1996 and gold glove winner was
selected to the all-star team three times.
</P>
<P>
But he struggled to find his place in society once his Major League
Baseball playing days ended three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He blasted 239 homers and 983 RBI and was a .272 career hitter. His
best season came in 1996, when he hit 40 home runs and 130 RBI for
the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
The much travelled Caminiti played for Atlanta, Houston, San Diego
and Texas.
</P>
<P>
Caminiti become the first American baseball player to publicly admit
using steroids in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret what's going on in baseball," said Caminiti, who
retired in 2001 after 15 years in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
"At least half the guys are using (steroids). They talk about it.
They joke about it with each other."
</P>
<P>
Caminiti said he used steroids for about eight years after injuring
his shoulder as a member of the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
"I got really strong, really quick. I pulled a lot of muscles. I
broke down a lot," he said.
</P>
<P>
Caminiti's best season was 1996 when, at age 33, he hit 40 homers had
130 runs batted in and a .326 batting average.
</P>
<P>
He said the steroid use was catching up to him.
</P>
<P>
"My tendons and ligaments got all torn up. My muscles got too strong
for my tendons and ligaments.
</P>
<P>
"And now my body's not producing testosterone. You know what that's
like? You get lethargic. You get depressed. It's terrible."
</P>
<P>
Caminiti is the latest athlete to die at a young age after admitting
to using performance enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Baseball implemented recent changes to its drug testing policies
which critics have called too lax.
</P>
<P>
Caminiti is just the latest professional athlete to die after
admitting steroid use.
</P>
<P>
Former National Football League star Lyle Alzado attributed excessive
steroid use to the brain cancer that killed him.
</P>
<P>
Alzado, who played from 1971-85, died at 43 on May 14, 1992. He, who
played for Los Angeles, Denver and Cleveland, insisted that almost 20
years of steroid use was the major contributing factor.

Major League Baseball slugger 
Barry Bonds could face a suspension if new claims detailing a 
history of doping are proven true, the Chicago Tribune reported 
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Citing unnamed sources within the sport, the newspaper reported 
that major league commissioner Bud Selig is considering a suspension 
for the San Francisco Giants star among a wide range of possible 
responses.
</P>
<P>
The report also said a ruling could be made before the Giants' 
April 3 season opener.
</P>
<P>
The Tribune also reported that Selig met with Bonds during 
spring training in 2004 over concerns about claims that Bonds took 
steroids.
</P>
<P>
Selig made a vague offer of leniency to Bonds if he had anything 
to confess, the Tribune reported, but also warned that consequences 
would be "much worse" if he proclaimed innocence and evidence blater 
revealed him as a steroid user.
</P>
<P>
Bonds is 47 home runs shy of Hank Aaron's all-time major league 
record of 755 career homers as he prepares for what he has said 
would be his farewell season.
</P>
<P>
Bonds was set to make his spring training debut Thursday for the 
Giants, two days after excerpts from the upcoming book "Game of 
Shadows" detailed a program of doping that began in 1998 and 
included his 2001 season, when he hit a one-season major league 
record of 73 homers.
</P>
<P>
Selig's initial response after reading the book excerpts in 
Sports Illustrated was "Why am I not surprised now?", the Tribune 
reported, adding that Selig has said, "It's even worse than I 
thought" about Bonds.
</P>
<P>
Greg Anderson, Bonds' personal trainer, was among four men 
convicted in the BALCO steroid distribution scandal. The book claims 
Anderson helped Bonds take a wide range of performance-enhancing 
drugs during seasons when the sport had no doping tests, not bound 
by World Anti-Doping Agency rules.

Ukraine's pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich and his
pro-Western rival Viktor Yushchenko, who will face off in the second
round of presidential elections this week, on Monday traded
accusations of corruption and incompetence in their first and only
televised debate.
</P>
<P>
During the live debate, Yanukovich slammed Yushchenko, reformist
prime minister of the former Soviet republic in 1999-2001, for having
closed down the Chernobyl power station, scene of the worst nuclear
accident in history.
</P>
<P>
"You are not a patriot. You made your country dependent when you
signed Chernobyl's closure," said Yanukovich, who is widely popular
in Ukraine's Russian-speaking east and who has Moscow's backing.
</P>
<P>
"You and your team are bankrupt functionaries who got together to
return to power. For you, all power is criminal unless it is yours,"
he scoffed.
</P>
<P>
"The new leadership is already here, it will not leave and there is
no way to expel it," he warned, also blaming Yushchenko for the
widespread corruption in Ukrainian society.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko in his turn condemned the "destructive economic policies"
of the current authorities, which he claimed controlled "the shadow
economy" and were to blame for widespread poverty and wage arrears.
</P>
<P>
He still bore marks from the mysterious poison-related illness, which
paralyzed and scarred part of his face and threatened to sideline him
from the campaign.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Yushchenko argued that Ukraine needed to keep up
good ties with both its powerful neighbors, the European Union as
well as Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We have strategic partners both in the east and the west, and it
would do us no good to lose the Russian market -- but it would be
wrong to turn away from the path into the European Union, which is
also one of the most important markets," Yushchenko argued.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovich, by contrast, accuses the EU of "a double-standard policy
toward Ukraine" and champions an economic union with Russia, Belarus
and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko, whose supporters are chiefly found in Ukraine's
nationalist west, also accused the authorities of corruption and
"acting on the principle of 'divide and rule'... on issues such as
our language and religion."
</P>
<P>
The run-off vote on November 21 will decide whether or not Ukraine,
with a population of 48 million people and a massive Soviet-era
military force, will move closer to Europe after decades of
domination by Russia.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko won 39.87 percent of the first round vote, held on October
31, against Yanukovich's 39.32 percent.
</P>
<P>
European and US officials strongly protested after Ukraines'
state-run television virtually denied all coverage to Yushchenko's
campaign, focusing on heavily on Yanukovich decision to boost
pensions weeks before the elections.

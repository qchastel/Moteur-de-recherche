YUSHCHENKO ABLE TO SERVE, BUT WILL NEED LONGTIME CARE

<P>
Viktor A. Yushchenko has recovered enough from poisoning with the
chemical dioxin that he should be able to serve as Ukraine's
president, but he will continue to need treatment for months if not
years, his doctors and foreign specialists said.
</P>
<P>
Still, they cautioned, his illness is virtually one-of-a-kind, caused
by ingesting a highly potent form of dioxin called TCDD. Under such
circumstances it is difficult to predict with great certainty the
course of his recovery, they said, and most of the treatment he will
need is somewhat experimental.
</P>
<P>
"The acute phase of his poisoning is now over, but he certainly needs
more treatment," said Michael Zimpfer, president of the
Rudolfinerhaus Hospital in Vienna, where Yushchenko was taken in
September, vomiting and in severe pain, after consuming the deadly
chemical. "Most of the treatment can be done in the Ukraine, but he
will have to return here for checkups."
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko, who is still suffering from disfiguring cysts on his
face, will need long-term treatment for his skin, Zimpfer said,
because such cysts can persist for years. He will need drugs to help
his body dispel the dioxin, which usually is deposited in fat cells.
And he will need close monitoring for signs of cancer and
abnormalities of fats in his blood, all possible aftereffects of the
poisoning, Zimpfer added. Yushchenko has consulted plastic surgeons
in Israel, news reports there say.
</P>
<P>
But Zimpfer said he has strongly advised against surgery for now.
"Surgery could jeopardize his recovery because it is a trauma to the
body in itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko's skin condition might recur even if it can be surgically
improved for now, because his body still contains high levels of
dioxin. In fact, scientists say they have virtually no experience
with this sort of poisoning, from a concentrated dose of TCDD.
</P>
<P>
"We don't even know the lethal dose for humans, because it's so
rare," said Nigel Walker, a staff scientist at the National Institute
of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, N.C. "We
know that it's not likely to kill people outright, but beyond that
there are a lot of questions. There have been very few instances of
high-level exposure."
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, doctors at Rudolfinerhaus announced that Yushchenko's
blood tests revealed levels of dioxin that were 1,000 times normal.
They had long suspected that his mysterious illness was caused by
intentional poisoning, although they would not speculate on the
source.
</P>
<P>
Days ago, a laboratory in the Netherlands that had received a sample
of his blood for more sophisticated testing, reported that it
contained TCDD, the most lethal form of dioxin. It contained only
pure TCDD, essentially confirming a poisoning.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way you could get this kind of pure TCDD level from an
accident -- it's incredibly high," said Bharat Chandramouli, a dioxin
specialist at Eno River Labs in Durham, N.C., which tests samples of
soil and water in the United States for the chemical. Almost all
prior cases of dioxin exposure have resulted from environmental
contamination, because dioxins are a toxic waste product of many
industrial processes. Human exposures tend to involve a mixture of
chemicals and result in far lower blood levels. Chandramouli added
that TCDD is such a concentrated poison that an amount smaller than a
grain of salt could produce the levels found in Yushchenko's blood.
This tiny amount would presumably be tasteless and odorless. Since
TCDD dissolves readily in oils, it could be slipped into food,
Chandramouli said.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko and his aides have said they believe that he was poisoned
at a dinner with the director of Ukrainian State Security in
September. TCDD can be made in an advanced chemistry lab or can be
bought in small amounts from chemical companies. It is used only to
calibrate sophisticated instruments that test for dioxins. "No one's
ever manufactured it in any great quantity and it has no legitimate
uses," Chandramouli said.
</P>
<P>
The spraying of Agent Orange in the Vietnam War first alerted
scientists to the toxicity of the dioxin, and people in Vietnam
continue to suffer from exposure to it. Other large-scale
contamination has occurred after industrial accidents or the dumping
of toxic wastes.
</P>
<P>
Environmental exposure is associated with an increased risk of
cancer. But doctors and dioxin specialists say that it is difficult
to predict the effects of pure TCDD when it is ingested, and say that
they will have to move forward with Yushchenko's case one step at a
time.

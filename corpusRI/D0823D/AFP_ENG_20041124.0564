Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko has a good chance of
making a full recovery from an illness that has prompted charges of
poisoning and ravaged his appearance, a Viennese doctor supervising
the case said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"If nothing hits him again, or nothing else has appeared in the
meanwhile, I guess he has a fair and great likelihood of making a
full recovery," Dr Michael Zimpfer, the president of Vienna's
Rudolfinerhaus Hospital where Yushchenko was treated, told AFP.

Zimpfer said Yushchenko, whose skin has been discoloured and
pockmarked by the illness, was also likely to regain the good looks
for which he is noted.
</P>
<P>
"It should be reversible. I have told him that the skin takes a much
longer period of recovery than the rest," said the doctor, adding the
50-year-old politician had been "a pretty healthy individual
beforehand."
</P>
<P>
"There was no underlying illness of the liver or pancreas that
suddenly broke out," he said.

<P>
West-leaning Yushchenko, who Wednesday called for a fresh vote as
official results showed Moscow-backed Viktor Yanukovich had defeated
him in Sunday's presidential election, was admitted to the private
Austrian hospital in September suffering from a severe
gastro-intestinal illness.

<P>
His camp immediately said it was the result of a poisoning attempt by
political rivals at a time when he had a strong lead over Yanukovich.
</P>
<P>
Press reports noted that Yushchenko fell ill after a meeting with the
former head of the KGB -- the Soviet agency which used drugs against
political foes and foreign spies.
</P>
<P>
Zimpfer said the hospital had found no evidence of poisoning and
neither had a medical insitute in the United States to which they
referred the case within days.
</P>
<P>
"They are examining blood and other samples. They are still
considering the theory of poisoning, but also finding difficulty in
proving it," he said, declining to name the US hospital as he had not
asked their permission.
</P>
<P>
Zimpfer said he regularly spoke to Yushchenko's family and his
doctors in Ukraine and therefore knew his symptoms but still had no
idea as to what caused them.
</P>
<P>
"I am privileged that they consult me for a second opinion. I know
all the symptoms, but I do not know the cause that kicked it off."
</P>
<P>
If there had been an attempt to poison the politician it would likely
have been done in a manner designed to look like an accident and
leave no forensic trace.

<P>
"We are completely convinced that it was not housewife's poison. We
would find that just by walking past him. That f/jms/gk

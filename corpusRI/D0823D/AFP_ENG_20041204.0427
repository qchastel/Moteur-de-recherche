Ukraine's defiant opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko says his family
has gone into hiding for fear of their safety, the Sunday Telegraph
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Even today, my family cannot live in Kiev," he told the newspaper in
an interview as Ukraine looked forward to fresh elections on December
26 after days of mass street protests.
</P>
<P>
"My children can't go to school. I believe the worst is behind us,
but still it is not safe for my family. It will not be safe before we
have completed the political transformation of this country."
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko has both US and Ukrainian citizenship. He and his wife
have three children, and appeared together on stage at a
demonstration Friday in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Saturday in his dacha on the outskirts of Kiev,
Yushchenko said he was determined to find out the facts behind a
suspected attempt to poison him by supporters of outgoing president
Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
His face remains disfigured as a result of a mystery illness which
struck during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Soon the world will know what happened," he said. "I will reveal all
the details of what they gave me to look like this."

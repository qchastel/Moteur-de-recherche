YUSHCHENKO SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KIEV, Ukraine
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Viktor A. Yushchenko, his face disfigured by poison
and his fate nearly undone by electoral fraud, took the
oath of office as president of Ukraine on Sunday, vowing
to unite a poor and deeply divided country and lead
it into the mainstream of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking first in parliament and then in Kiev's central square, Yushchenko
declared Ukraine's freedom and independence in thinly veiled remarks aimed
at the outgoing president, Leonid D. Kuchma, and at Russia
and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, who openly supported Yushchenko's
opponent.
</P>
<P>
"Armed only by their faith and beliefs, the people won a
beautiful and peaceful victory," he told tens of thousands of
Ukrainians waving flags and banners in Independence Square, the site
of the demonstrations that helped usher him to office. "It
is a victory of freedom over tyranny, of law over
lawlessness, of future over past."
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko's inauguration punctuated an extraordinary period in Ukraine's history that included
two rounds of voting last fall, followed by huge street
protests and a legal challenge that ultimately overturned the declared
victory of his opponent, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and led to
the third round of voting on Dec. 26 in which
Yushchenko triumphed.
</P>
<P>
In his speeches, Yushchenko, 50, was alternately conciliatory and defiant. His,
he said, was a victory for all Ukrainians, and he
pledged to honor the people's right to worship in their
own faith, to embrace their own politics and to speak
in the language of their ancestors; the last was a
reference to the divisive issue of the Russian language, which
Yanukovych had promised to make equal in law to Ukrainian.
Ukrainian, proscribed by the Soviets, was made the country's official
language after the country declared its independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko also vowed to fight the corruption and the shadowy economy
that had become characteristic of the tumultuous decade under Kuchma,
where a few people closely allied with power accumulated vast
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
"We shall create a democratic power -- honest, professional and patriotic,"
Yushchenko said. "The wall that separates government from the people
will be destroyed."
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko, a former central banker and prime minister under the man
he ultimately replaced, became the third president of this country
of 48 million people since it declared its independence from
the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He did so facing not only the usual challenges of a
new leader, but also expectations intensified by the eruption of
public discontent after efforts by Kuchma's government to install Yanukovych
as Kuchma's chosen successor.
</P>
<P>
"The expectations are too great," Yulia Tishchenko, of the Ukrainian Center
for Independent Political Research in Kiev, said in an interview
before the inauguration, warning that the public's jubilation over Yushchenko's
victory would soon confront the harsh reality of governance. "Different
segments of the population have different expectations. And he will
not be able, in a short period of time, to
live up to them."
</P>
<P>
The country has been strained by stark divisions of wealth, by
poverty and by unemployment, which has forced millions to seek
work abroad. Recent economic growth has slowed, while the federal
budget has gone from a surplus to a deficit within
months after a raft of campaign-related expenditures on pensions and
other social benefits under Yanukovych, who until Dec. 31 was
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko's aides and independent analysts also said that during the prolonged
electoral dispute, the government continued to sell off state assets
and provide long-term leases on commercial buildings in Kiev and
entire enterprises in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"They are basically stealing stuff," said Roman M. Zvarich, a member
of Yushchenko's coalition in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Above all, Ukraine remains politically divided. In spite of Yushchenko's pleas
for unity, Yanukovych did not attend the inauguration. Kuchma, who
did, did not answer Yushchenko's subsequent call for all in
parliament to join him for his inaugural address on Independence
Square.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko also faces the difficulty of holding together the broad but
fractious coalition that challenged the results of the first runoff.
He has yet to announce his appointments for prime minister
and other posts in the new Cabinet, a delay that
experts say has already delayed the momentum of his presidency
in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the acting prime minister, Mykola Y. Azarov, who took
over when Yanukovych stepped aside, announced his resignation, as required
by law. But in Yushchenko's first act as president, he
asked Azarov and the current government to continue working until
he chose a new government.
</P>
<P>
"The choice was always between a consolidation of democracy or a
consolidation of authoritarianism," Hryhoriy M. Nemyria, director of the European
Center for International Studies in Kiev, said in an interview.
"The choice was made toward the consolidation of democracy, but
it needs to be consolidated. The revolution is only the
beginning."
</P>
<P>
The inauguration was attended by the presidents of seven countries --
Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, Lativa and Molodova -- as
well as by political leaders from many others. For the
United States, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell attended. Russia
sent Sergei M. Mironov, the speaker of the upper house
of parliament.
</P>
<P>
As each of the leaders was announced in parliament, the loudest
applause erupted for the leaders of countries who had over
the decades risen up against Soviet domination: President Aleksandr Kwasniewski
of Poland; Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president; and Nana
Burdzhanadze, the speaker of Georgia's parliament.
</P>
<P>
Powell met with Yushchenko before the inauguration and, echoing a congratulatory
telephone call from President Bush on Saturday, said the United
States was prepared to help in the country's transition. "The
United States wants to do everything we can to help
you meet the expectations of the Ukrainian people," Powell said,
making an unexpected final overseas trip as secretary after a
delay in the confirmation of Condoleezza Rice as his successor.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko, after their meeting, responded with a list of requests, including
recognition of Ukraine as a market economy, support for its
membership in the World Trade Organization, and a lifting of
sanctions imposed under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, a Cold-War era law
that limits trade because of Soviet restrictions on emigration.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko later spoke of Sunday as a turning point in the
country's history. "Today's event has proven once more that the
Ukrainian nation and the Ukrainian state have arrived," he said
in parliament, after taking the oath of office with his
arm draped over a 500-year-old Bible and a copy of
the constitution. "Citizens of Ukraine have achieved a fair election.
A legitimate handover of power has taken place."
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko later vowed that he would lead Ukraine into its proper
place in Europe -- and specifically in the European Union,
which has only just absorbed many of Ukraine's Central and
Eastern European neighbors and appears wary of inviting still another
larger, developing nation.
</P>
<P>
"We are no longer on the edge of Europe," he said.
"We are situated in the center of Europe."
</P>
<P>
Throughout Kiev, the mood was ebullient. Rivers of orange -- flags,
banners, scarves and hats in the color of Yushchenko's campaign
-- coursed through the streets.
</P>
<P>
For many in Independence Square, it was enough to witness Yushchenko's
inauguration and his address, which ended with confetti and balloons
rising into a cold, leaden sky and a concert of
the songs that provided the revolution its overture.
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, to the last day I did
not think it would happen," said Vitaly K. Samusevych, a
retired miner who had joined the thousands who went to
the streets to protest the initial results that made Yanukovych
the winner. "When he showed up today, I cried."
</P>
<P>
Natalia D. Shafar, an economist and translator, came to the square
with her daughter, Olya. She said the events of the
last months had created a "national idea," something Ukraine lacked
before.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we do not expect that overnight we will have
a better life," she said, "but at least now we
have hope."

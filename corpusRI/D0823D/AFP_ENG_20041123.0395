Ukraine's opposition deputies on Tuesday proclaimed Viktor Yushchenko
the winner of the weekend's disputed presidential runoff in an
emergency parliament meeting that failed to reach quorum.

"Today we are proclaimed Viktor Yushchenko the president of Ukraine,
and he will assume his functions starting today," opposition deputy
Yulia Timoshenko said.

The meeting was attended by 191 of the Rada's 450 deputies. The
session was boycotted by the pro-government majority that supports
pro-Moscow Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, who is leading the
official count from Sunday's vote.

"It's an encouraging step forward but there's work to be done in 
terms of implementing it," the spokesman told AFP.

Australia stood ready to help North Korea in terms of energy 
assistance, development aid and compliance expertise, he added.

In the agreement reached Monday, North Korea pledged to give up 
its nuclear weapons in exchange for promises of aid and security.

Other nations agreed to "recognise" the North's demand for 
nuclear energy and said Pyongyang's request to have a light-water 
nuclear reactor for peaceful purposes would be revisited "at an 
appropriate time".

Russia's atomic chief said his country was ready to build a nuclear power
station for North Korea after the communist regime's breakthrough pledge Monday
to abandon its nuclear weapons program, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Federal Atomic Energy Agency chief Alexander Rumyantsev said the offer was in
line with the agreement reached in Beijing, under which the other parties in the
talks _ the United States, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea _ pledged energy
assistance to impoverished North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Rumyantsev said such assistance could involve construction of a nuclear power
station in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
"We do build nuclear power stations abroad, we could do the same in North
Korea," Rumyantsev was quoted by ITAR-Tass as saying. "Everyone knows about the
energy shortage in North Korea, therefore we must act quickly."
</P>
<P>
South Korea has offered to send electricity to North Korea across the heavily
armed border dividing the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Rumyantsev didn't rule out revival of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization, a consortium set up in 1995 to build two light-water nuclear power
plants for North Korea as part of a deal to shut down its weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
The US$4.6 billion (euro3.8 billion) KEDO construction project that involved the
United States, South Korea and Japan has been on hold since 2003, after the
United States confronted North Korea with evidence it had sought to secretly
develop nuclear weapons by enriching uranium.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which is eager to earn on its substantial expertise in the nuclear
industry, has pursued a US$800 million (euro658 million) project to build Iran
its first nuclear reactor, despite U.S objections.

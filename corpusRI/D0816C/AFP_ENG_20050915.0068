The United States and North Korea have 
failed to narrow their differences in their latest one-on-one 
meeting Thursday, a South Korean official said as nuclear 
disarmament talks spluttered on.
</P>
<P>
US envoy Christopher Hill held a 90-minute meeting with North 
Korean counterpart Kim Gye-gwan, but the talks led nowhere.
</P>
<P>
"I understand North Korea and the United States did not narrow 
their differences," said a South Korean official. 
</P>
<P>
"On their way out of the meeting, they had stiff faces."
</P>
<P>
It was the second bilateral meeting between the two men since 
six-nation talks aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its 
nuclear weapons programs resumed on Tuesday. They also had an 
informal dinner meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are deadlocked over North Korea's demand to be 
allowed nuclear programs for peaceful purposes, which Washington 
rejects.

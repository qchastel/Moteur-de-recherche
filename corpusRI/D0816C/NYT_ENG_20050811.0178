EDITORIAL: NUCLEAR TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA, IRAN HIT SNAGS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Six-party talks about North Korea's nuclear arsenal have recessed after a
13-day session in Beijing. That they lasted so long is
encouraging: Three previous rounds ended after only three days.
</P>
<P>
But the road ahead -- with North Korea and with Iran,
which has rejected a European proposal to curb its nuclear
program in return for generous benefits -- looks bumpy at
best.
</P>
<P>
The Korean negotiations -- bringing together the United States, North Korea,
South Korea, China, Japan and Russia -- are to resume
near the end of this month. But North Korea's attempt
to put all the blame on Washington for the lack
of substantive progress suggests that getting past basic differences may
be impossible. The Bush administration wants North Korea to dismantle
its nuclear arsenal and other nuclear activities as a first
step in a process that would include security, economic and
diplomatic benefits for Pyongyang. But North Korea insists on keeping
a nuclear reactor for generation of electricity.
</P>
<P>
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty allows all member countries to develop nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes. But North Korea has withdrawn from
the treaty and says it has built nuclear weapons because
of Washington's "hostile policies" toward it.
</P>
<P>
Even if that hurdle could be overcome, Pyongyang's secret nuclear activities
that came to light only in 2002 are a damning
indictment. At a minimum, North Korea would have to accept
a comprehensive United Nations inspection program for any agreement to
have credibility.
</P>
<P>
Iran's situation is slightly different. Tehran remains a party to the
nonproliferation treaty, but it has admitted keeping secret for 17
years a program that also was revealed only recently. Now
it insists on exercising its right under the treaty to
develop nuclear energy. This week, after rejecting a European Union
compromise plan, it unilaterally ended an agreement it made last
fall with the EU to suspend nuclear activities by resuming
conversion of uranium into a gas, an early phase in
a process that could lead either to civilian energy generation
or production of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
President Bush, who once called both Iran and North Korea part
of an "axis of evil," has now become conciliatory toward
Tehran, which despite its rejection of the EU plan says
it wants to continue negotiations. It's also doubtful that taking
Iran's case to the U.N. Security Council, as both U.S.
and European officials have said they might do, would result
in sanctions. Both China and Russia have strong reservations about
sanctions, in part because of lucrative energy deals with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the U.S. approach is the right one. It's
important that the United States and its European allies maintain
a united front, neither closing the door to potential solutions
nor yielding on fundamental principles aimed at preventing the breakdown
of nuclear arms control.

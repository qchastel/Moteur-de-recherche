Chicago Slaying Probe Focuses on Hate Group

<P>
The war of words against U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow
lasted two years, a baffling, ominous campaign. It ended in the
conviction of Matthew Hale, a white supremacist who fixated on Lefkow
for having thwarted the movement he called his ``church.'' Now a task
force of investigators is trying to learn whether Hale's intimidating
words led to murder.
</P>
<P>
A federal jury last year found Hale, 33, guilty of trying to
arrange Lefkow's murder. After two years of taunts -- with the judge's
personal information and family photographs posted on racist Web sites
-- Lefkow could finally breathe easy. Hale was isolated in jail,
awaiting sentencing. His communication to the outside world was
curtailed and his extremist followers left in disarray.
</P>
<P>
But in the days since the judge stumbled upon the carnage inside
her north side Chicago home, discovering the bullet-riddled bodies of
her husband, Michael Lefkow, 64, and her mother, Donna Humphrey, 89,
Hale's racially obsessed ``Creativity'' movement again has drawn
intense scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have questioned Hale about the war of nerves he once
waged and about lingering resentment of Judge Lefkow. Authorities have
pressed his supporters about their communications with the jailed
extremist and the possibility of involvement by leaderless ``lone
wolf'' killers.
</P>
<P>
``They're looking for coded messages,'' said Kathleen Robertazzo, a
Hale intimate who said she was questioned twice this week by FBI
agents, who also copied her computer hard drive.
</P>
<P>
``They said they're looking for any communications between me and
any of the members to see if there were plans to do anything,''
Robertazzo said Friday. The freelance court reporter said that the
agents had seized dozens of letters Hale sent to her from his tightly
monitored cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Hale is virtually isolated from the outside world, not allowed
contact with other prisoners and barred from any visitors except for
his family. As a result, federal investigators are pursuing the notion
that the judge's relatives could have been targeted by white
supremacists acting without guidance.
</P>
<P>
Police also are searching for two men whom they have described as
``material witnesses'' -- spotted near the Lefkow home hours before
the bodies were found Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
FBI and Chicago law enforcement officials have declined to speak
publicly about any theories. ``Obviously, Matt Hale and his prior
conviction is an avenue we have to explore,'' FBI special agent Robert
D. Grant said Friday as he announced a $50,000 reward for information
in the case.
</P>
<P>
``We're not going to become myopic,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
But if Hale and his coterie of extremists have become the most
obvious targets for questioning in the federal manhunt,the origins of
their enmity toward Lefkow remain inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
``It's just so hard to understand,'' said Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer,
a colleague of Lefkow on the federal bench in the Northern District of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
Hate-group experts who have tracked Hale's ``Creativity'' movement
for a decade say that the growth of his World Church of the Creator
was a textbook example of a magnetic, racially obsessed activist who
surrounded himself with adoring followers and used controversy to gain
notoriety in extremist circles.
</P>
<P>
``On one level, he was pretty smart about it. He did what most of
these extremist leaders do: stir up controversy and bring in people
who were dependent on him,'' said Devin Burghart, a researcher with
the Chicago-based Center for New Community who has monitored Hale and
his faction for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
But Burghart and others say that Hale's demonization of Lefkow was
a perplexing act of self-destruction. ``When you go after a federal
judge, you're just asking for trouble,'' Burghart said.
</P>
<P>
The collision course was set when Hale took over the reins of the
World Church of the Creator, a supremacist sect started in 1971 by Ben
Klassen. The former Florida state legislator had forecast a ``racial
holy war'' that would leave Aryans victorious over Jews, blacks and
other inferior ``mud people.''
</P>
<P>
Hale, the intense son of an East Peoria, Ill., police officer, was
chosen in 1996 ``Pontifex Maximus'' of the racially obsessed
``religion'' -- replete with a ``White Man's Bible'' and Aryan
marriage and communion ceremonies.
</P>

</P>
<P>
An accomplished classical violinist and a graduate of Southern
Illinois University law school, Hale revived the faction. Days after
Hale was notified that he had failed the Illinois state bar exam in
1999, Benjamin Smith -- a Hale disciple -- went on a shooting rampage
through Chicago's north shore, aiming at minorities with a .22-caliber
pistol. He killed two people and wounded nine.
</P>
<P>
Membership in Hale's movement surged in the months afterward, to as
many as 88 chapters across the United States. Hale claimed 30,000
followers, although hate-group experts said those numbers were
inflated.
</P>
<P>
The group also made inroads with neo-Nazi factions in state prisons
by distributing white supremacist tracts under the guise of spiritual
materials, Burghart said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
In 2002, a conflict with an Oregon religious group also known as
the World Church of the Creator threw Hale's organization into
turmoil. When the Oregon church sued for copyright infringement, the
case went before Lefkow.
</P>
<P>
The judge at first ruled in Hale's favor. But when she was
overruled by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, she ordered Hale's
group to change the name it used on the books it sold at rallies and
over the Internet. Hale's followers did not comply, and Lefkow
responded by threatening to fine the organization $1,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
Lefkow then was the enemy. According to testimony in Hale's murder
solicitation trial, he told aides that Lefkow's order ``places our
church in a state of war.'' He vowed to ``teach this judge a lesson.''
</P>
<P>
Talking to one aide of ``intimidation,'' Hale began planning
demonstrations in front of Lefkow's home and at the federal courthouse
in downtown Chicago. And he pressed followers to obtain her address
and other personal information -- including pictures of her husband
and four daughters -- that ended up posted across several extremist
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
``It was a terribly unjust thing for a really wonderful family,''
said Pallmeyer. But the judge never complained to colleagues. ``She
endured it with dignity,'' Pallmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
In January 2003, Hale was arrested by FBI agents and charged with
trying to arrange Lefkow's murder. Hale's security chief had been
working with the FBI. In taped conversations, the informant asked the
Pontifex Maximus if ``we're gonna exterminate the rat.''
</P>
<P>
Hale replied: ``Well, whatever you wanna do, basically.''
</P>

<P>
Throughout the trial and after Hale's conviction, friends said, the
Lefkows -- who had lived on the same quiet residential street for 20
years -- clung to familiar routines. They still took evening strolls
to stores and restaurants on Clark Street. Michael Lefkow, a veteran
employment rights lawyer, wore his trademark fedora. At dinner
parties, the Lefkows made light of the surveillance cameras installed
outside their home before sitting down and saying grace.
</P>
<P>
Privately, Michael Lefkow worried. At his law office one day, he
asked attorney Paul Bradley if he could start locking a hallway door
that had always been open to the public.
</P>
<P>
``I told him, `Only if I can wear a T-shirt that said: Not Lefkow,'
'' Bradley recalled. ``We both laughed about it, but I could tell he
was concerned.''
</P>
<P>
Several of Lefkow's fellow judges said they also were frightened.
``Through the entire Matthew Hale trial, we were concerned,'' said
U.S. District Judge Wayne R. Andersen, who since the murders has urged
the Justice Department to reassess the security arrangements it
provides to judges and their families.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the Lefkows found their life easing again. The
precautions taken by U.S. marshals to protect them were scaled back.
The cameras were removed. A security detail that had patrolled nearby
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
The war of nerves, it seemed, was over.
</P>
<P>
``You could tell they were relieved,'' a family friend said. ``Hale
was behind bars, and his group was falling apart. We all thought it
was finally over and done with. Now we don't know what to think.''

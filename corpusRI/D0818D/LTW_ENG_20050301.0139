Relatives of U.S. Judge Slain in Chicago Home

<DATELINE>
CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow spent
weeks under federal protection after a white supremacist in her court
threatened to have her killed. But when the suspect was behind bars,
Lefkow felt safe enough to drop the security detail provided her by
the U.S. Marshals Service.
</P>
<P>
Monday night Lefkow returned from work to discover the bodies of
her husband and her elderly mother in the basement of her home on
Chicago's north side. Both had been shot. Tuesday, as marshals were
again providing Lefkow with around-the-clock protection, and dozens of
detectives and FBI agents began searching for a motive and suspect in
the murders, speculation centered on the followers of Matthew Hale,
convicted last year of obstruction of justice and ordering Lefkow's
killing.
</P>
<P>
Lefkow had enraged Hale and his supporters when she ordered Hale's
group to change its name after it lost a trademark-infringement suit
to an Oregon church with a similar name, and later held Hale in
contempt and fined him $200,000. More than once since then, someone
posted the judge's address on the Web and pasted in a biography and
photograph of her husband Michael Lefkow, a 64-year-old lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Careful not to push the evidence too far too fast, a police
supervisor said Tuesday that investigators are looking in ``many, many
directions.''
</P>
<P>
``The case is too new. The evidence is still being worked up,''
said James Molloy, chief of detectives. He said police found much to
study at the crime scene near Chicago's lakefront.
</P>
<P>
Molloy said the killing took place sometime between 10:30 a.m.,
when Lefkow's mother, Donna Grace Humphrey, 89, took a call from one
of her granddaughters, and about 5:30 p.m., when Lefkow returned home.
At 4 p.m., one of the Lefkows' four daughters hurriedly entered the
house to grab a gym bag, but did not see her father or grandmother
before she left for a workout.
</P>
<P>
At the federal courthouse, where Joan Lefkow had worked since her
2000 appointment to the bench by President Bill Clinton, disbelief
defined the day.
</P>
<P>
``She is one of the loveliest, most principled human beings who has
ever walked the face of this earth,'' said one friend, who described
the Lefkows, married in 1975, as ``caring and compassionate people.
They are family-oriented people, very religious people, but not in a
judgmental way.''
</P>
<P>
Because of the notoriety of the Hale assassination plot, few seemed
to believe the killings could be a coincidence. In the upscale,
tree-lined Edgewater neighborhood where Lefkow lives, Eddy McDonough
said he had seen squad cars parked outside the judge's house in the
past. He considered it a targeted attack.
</P>
<P>
``This is a hit,'' McDonough said. ``Most people living here don't
feel threatened, since this wasn't aimed at them, but we're in
shock.''
</P>
<P>
On average, about 700 threats are made against court officers each
year, according to the Marshals Service, which secures federal
courthouses across the country. In 2003, marshals managed special
security for 20 federal judges and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
If the Chicago killings are eventually connected to Lefkow's work
on the bench, it will be the first time that relatives of a federal
judge have been murdered. Three judges have been assassinated.
</P>
<P>
Mark Potok, chief of the hate group monitoring project at the
Southern Poverty Law Center, said he believed it was ``highly likely
that a follower or sympathizer of Matt Hale is responsible. This is a
group with a really remarkable record of criminal violence. The
members of this group have been involved in murder, bank robbery,
innumerable beatings and aggravated assaults.''
</P>
<P>
Hale is now being held in a federal prison under rules that
severely restrict his contact with outsiders and is scheduled to be
sentenced for the murder solicitation conviction April 6th.
</P>
<P>
He became widely known in 1999 when a supporter named Benjamin
Smith went on a racially motivated shooting spree in Illinois and
Indiana, killing two people, including former Northwestern University
basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong, and wounding nine others.
</P>
<P>
Hale, who called himself the Pontifex Maximus of his self-styled
World Church of the Creator, said Smith was a martyr ``who gave his
life for us.'' After Lefkow ordered the group to change its name, Hale
said a ``state of war'' existed between the judge and the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Hale's dispute with Lefkow began with a civil lawsuit filed by an
Oregon church with a similar name that feared people would link it to
Hale's racist message. Lefkow sided with Hale, but an appeals court
overruled her. When Hale and his colleagues refused to stop using the
name, she ordered them held in contempt.
</P>
<P>
While the case was working its way through the courts, prosecutors
said later, Hale -- who called Lefkow ``corrupt'' and a ``probable
Jew'' -- asked his security chief for Lefkow's home address and tried
to persuade him to assassinate her. The security chief was a federal
informant who secretly taped Hale soliciting the judge's murder.
</P>
<P>
White supremacists viewed Hale as a political prisoner and raised
money for his defense. Slurs against Lefkow and her family were
common. A relatively mild one called her a ``sycophantic cow'' who did
the ``Jews' bidding.''
</P>
<P>
At least three times, Potok said, the Lefkows' home address was
posted on the Web.
</P>
<P>
Lefkow refused to pass the trademark case to another judge, writing
in 2003 that Hale should not be allowed ``to intimidate a judge off
the case.'' She noted that Hale had said he wanted to ``exterminate''
her, but said his ``is a one-sided war in which this court is not
embroiled.''
</P>
<P>
Besides, she wrote, she had not seen or heard of ``any suspicious
conduct by any member of World Church in or around her home, her
office or places that her immediate family members frequent.''
</P>
<P>
Hale's conviction in April 2004 brought a sense of relief to the
judge and her family. Michael Lefkow thanked the law officers and
friends who had helped the Lefkows and said, ``We hope Mr. Hale will
repent of his advocacy of evil.''

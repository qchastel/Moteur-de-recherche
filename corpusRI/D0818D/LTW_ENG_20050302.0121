Authorities Probe Evidence as Judges Call for Better Protection

A window shard, spent shell casings and a bloody mop emerged as key
pieces of evidence Wednesday in the apparent execution-style murders
of the husband and mother of a U.S. district court judge in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Returning to her home on the city's north side Monday, Judge Joan
Humphrey Lefkow discovered the bodies of her husband, Michael Lefkow,
64, and mother, Donna Humphrey, 89. Both victims had been shot to
death.
</P>
<P>
Authorities stressed that federal agents and local detectives had
not yet narrowed the scope of their investigation. But several
law-enforcement officials and media reports Wednesday indicated that
task force members were leaning toward considering it a premeditated
crime. The victims apparently were forced to lie down on the basement
floor before they were shot in the head and chest.
</P>
<P>
``There is nothing spur-of-the moment or anything that would
indicate this was a crime of passion,'' one official said, adding that
the slayings bore the hallmarks of ``an execution.''
</P>
<P>
Authorities also found a bloody shoe print and a blood-streaked
mop, indicating there was an effort to clean up the crime scene, the
Chicago Tribune reported.
</P>
<P>
Chicago police spokesman David Bayless said FBI forensics experts
at the bureau's laboratory in Quantico, Va., would analyze ballistics
evidence retrieved from the home. At least two .22-caliber shell
casings reportedly were recovered from the Lefkow residence.
</P>
<P>
Bayless and other officials would not provide specific details
about evidence retrieved from the house, out of concern that leaks
about the investigation might aid the killer or killers. ``We're going
to be vague and general for the time being,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
A security detail of federal marshals was guarding Lefkow and other
family members at an undisclosed location. The judge and her husband
briefly received protection last year during the trial of a white
supremacist who later was convicted of trying to arrange her murder.
</P>
<P>
The extremist leader, Matthew Hale, is awaiting sentencing next
month.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday for the Chicago Tribune, Lefkow said she
always knew her job put her at risk but never thought it would
endanger her family.
</P>
<P>
``It's so unthinkable,'' the judge said. ``I imagine my husband
must have just walked into something,'' Lefkow said. ``Both of them
were on crutches. They didn't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
The judge's husband had recently injured his leg and had surgery.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. district judges who work with Lefkow called for officials
Wednesday to reassess security arrangements for the nation's federal
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
``This horrible tragedy has got to serve as the basis for a
substantial increase in security for judges and their families,'' U.S.
District Judge Wayne R. Andersen said. ``The Internet is plastered
with information about every one of us, and I fear -- and my family
certainly fears -- that these kinds of incidents are going to be
repeated unless there is a very high priority on the safety of judges
and their families.''
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Marvin E. Aspen also asked for a new look at
security measures. Dan Lehman, a spokesman for the U.S. Northern
District of Illinois, said that Andersen had talked to Chief Judge
Charles P. Kocoras about his concerns and that some other judges
working out of Chicago's downtown federal courthouse had expressed
worries since the killings.
</P>
<P>
``There's real concern that there needs to be a dispassionate,
comprehensive look at security arrangements in light of these
homicides,'' Lehman said.

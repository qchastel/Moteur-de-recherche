The man authorities have said killed Judge Joan Lefkow's
husband and mother also sent hostile, puzzling letters to state and
federal officials six years ago, sparking an investigation by the
Illinois attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
Former state investigators visited Bart Ross' home in the Chicago
area suburb of Albany Park in 1999 and began a file on him. It
included notes that Ross sent to then-Attorney General James Ryan and
other government officials, said Dan Curry, who was Ryan's press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Some of the notes used inflammatory language and underscored Ross'
anger at the government and judicial system. Others were simply
rambling.
</P>
<P>
Ross, 57, an unemployed electrician, shot himself to death during a
traffic stop outside Milwaukee last week. He was linked by DNA traces
and suicide notes to the Lefkow murders.
</P>
<P>
In September, the judge had dismissed a billion-dollar lawsuit Ross
had filed alleging that a group of doctors at the University of
Illinois-Chicago Hospital had disfigured his face and throat during
cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
After Ross committed suicide, Curry said he received a call from
the executive security detail, which guards state officials such as
the attorney general, the governor and the secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
''They told me that they had some contact with (Ross), and that it
was threatening to the attorney general and other people,`` said
Curry, who runs a political consulting business in Wheaton. ''They
basically considered him as someone to keep an eye on. There was no
direct threat of violence, but there was a lot of inflammatory
language and erratic-type statements.``
</P>
<P>
Curry did not know which other officials received letters from
Ross. Officials from the executive security detail could not be
reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ross also had sent packages of court and other material to various
government officials, including Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill. In
June, a Durbin spokesman said, Ross walked into the senator's offices
in Chicago and dropped off a thick binder filled with files from his
court cases.

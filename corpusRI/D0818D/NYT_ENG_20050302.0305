</HEADLINE>

CHICAGO - The police released composite sketches Wednesday night of two
white men they want to question in connection with this
week's execution-style slayings of a federal judge's mother and husband,
in an investigation that has also included interviews with relatives,
friends and sympathizers of a white-supremacist imprisoned for soliciting the
judge's assassination.
</P>
<P>
The authorities would not say where or when the two men,
one in his mid-20s and the other aged 50 to
60, were seen or whether they were suspects or witnesses.
The police refused to discuss whether these men might be
connected to the hate groups that have been a prime
focus of the investigation.

Evelyn Hutcheson and David Hale, the mother and brother of Matthew
Hale, the man convicted last year of plotting the murder
of the judge, Joan Humphrey Lefkow, said Wednesday that federal
agents had asked them whether Hale might have communicated something
from prison in code.

<P>
In addition, Hal Turner, a white-supremacist radio host in New Jersey
who said in 2003 that it would be illegal but
not wrong to kill Lefkow said Wednesday that federal agents
had also questioned him about his whereabouts during the Monday
killings.
</P>
<P>
Hutcheson, recalled the agents asking Tuesday at her home in East
Peoria, Ill., "Does he have a code, did he tell
me something in code, which is about the dumbest thing
I've ever heard." She added, "It's obvious they're trying to
link Matt to the killings."
</P>
<P>
David Hale' told the authorities that he came home from his
maintenance job at 1:30 p.m. Monday, took a nap, ate
dinner and watched a movie with his children, then went
to a local convenience store that has a security camera.
</P>
<P>
"They know where I was and I've been cleared," David Hale
said Wednesday. "They asked if there was an encrypted code,
a cryptic message or an encoded thing. I told my
mother not to answer. They said they were going to
leave no stone unturned."
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Wednesday's issue of The Chicago Sun-Times,
the authorities are also pursuing telephone calls made to Lefkow's
home Sunday night from a correctional facility.
</P>
<P>
Lefkow, 61, spoke publicly Wednesday for the first time since the
slayings, telling The Sun-Times that she is "just furious" that
the killings might be linked to her job.
</P>
<P>
"I fear that to be true, and that's the great tragedy
of it," Lefkow said, according to an article posted Wednesday
evening on The Sun-Times Web site. "If someone was angry
at me, they should go after me. It's not fair
to go after my family."

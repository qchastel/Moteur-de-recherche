Suspect in Murder of Judge's Family Nursed Grudge Over Lawsuit

<P>
The killer broke into U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow's
home and hid in a utility closet. Furious that she had rejected his
rambling lawsuit, he planned to wait until she came home and then
shoot her dead.
</P>
<P>
But the judge's husband found the man first.
</P>
<P>
``I had no choice ... but to shoot him,'' wrote Bart Ross in a
suicide note received Thursday by a Chicago television station. ``Then
I heard a voice, 'Michael, Michael,' so I looked to the hallway ...
and saw an older woman. I had to shoot her, too.
</P>
<P>
``I followed with a second shot to the head in both cases to
minimize their suffering.''
</P>
<P>
Chicago police announced Thursday that Ross, who killed himself
with a single shot to the head in a Milwaukee suburb Wednesday night,
is the principal suspect in the Feb. 28 murder of Lefkow's husband and
mother, a disturbing case that sent shudders through the federal
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
As the FBI and the Illinois crime lab studied DNA and fingerprints
for a match, Chicago police Supt. Phil Cline told reporters that
letters left by the 57-year-old electrician contained details only the
killer would know. He also said a witness saw someone resembling Ross
leaving the Lefkows' home on the day of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
But Cline emphasized that police were not prepared to make a
definitive statement until the evidence had been analyzed. ``This case
is by no means closed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The sudden development in the case startled investigators, who had
focused on the fact that Judge Lefkow had been targeted for
assassination by white supremacist Matthew Hale. Investigators thought
it likely that a Hale sympathizer committed the murders and
specialists pointed out that Lefkow's address was posted on hate
groups' Web sites.
</P>
<P>
It remains publicly unknown how Ross found Lefkow's home, but
investigators said they had found no connection between hate groups
and Ross, who blamed his anger on a legal and medical establishment
that he said had ``violated me Nazi-style'' for 12 years. In his
writings, Ross named other potential targets, including judges and
doctors he felt had done him wrong.
</P>
<P>
More than one judge and lawyer fearful that Lefkow was targeted by
supremacists said the prospect of a disgruntled and murderous litigant
is even more worrisome. Judges in all jurisdictions must deal with
aggrieved petitioners whose problems they cannot fix.
</P>
<P>
``In many respects this is more sobering and more frightening
because there are many more people like this man who could have a
similar grudge against a judge,'' said Chicago Bar Association
President Joy Cunningham, a former judge. ``Many litigants come to
court with expectations the system is not able to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
Ross's gripes began in the mid-1990s, after he had been treated for
mouth cancer at the University of Illinois at Chicago hospital.
Disfigured by the treatment, which left him cancer-free, according to
the hospital, he became convinced that he had been the victim of
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
After a string of state and federal judges had rejected his claims,
Ross last year filed a federal lawsuit that was randomly assigned to
Lefkow. His anger came through in documents seeking more than $500
million from the state of Illinois, and millions more from doctors and
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
``Lawyers are telling me to get a doctor and doctors are telling me
to get a lawyer,'' Ross wrote. He said he drove more than 5,000 miles
and contacted more than 100 lawyers and 200 medical experts in search
of someone who would fight his case with him. After one lawyer took
the case and lost, Ross sued her.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who was facing an eviction notice, said he lost all his upper
teeth during the treatment and needed to have his jaw rebuilt. The
hospital said in a statement Thursday that Ross received
``conservative and appropriate care,'' and that disfigurement is a
common result of the treatment.
</P>
<P>
``He was becoming obsessed with the issue and more and more
paranoid,'' said Don Rose, a Chicago political consultant whose
partner hired Ross to do electrical work. He said Ross asked his help
in filing his lawsuits and later asked him for money. Rose said he
recommended several lawyers but did not give him any money.
</P>
<P>
Investigators studying the murders of Michael Lefkow, 64, and Donna
Humphrey, 89, had reached a series of dead ends. DNA and a fingerprint
taken from the Lefkows' home found no matches on federal databases.
Interviews of Hale and his associates turned up nothing substantial.
</P>
<P>
Cline said Ross's name was on a list of litigants whom FBI agents
and detectives had intended to interview. He said police were working
their way through 600 tips and hundreds of cases in Lefkow's court and
the business relations of her husband, a labor lawyer.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday evening, a patrolman in West Allis, Wis., spotted a
man in a brown van on a little-used street. He appeared to be writing
something. When the man made a U-turn and drove away, the officer
pulled him over for having no tail lights.
</P>
<P>
As the officer approached, the man -- who turned out to be Ross --
shot himself. Several hours later, police discovered in the car what
investigators described as a suicide note linking him to the Lefkow
case. They also found .22-caliber shells consistent with the bullets
used in the murder.
</P>
<P>
The letter to NBC affiliate WMAQ, which Cline described as
consistent with the document found with Ross, portrayed Ross as a
victim no less than the Lefkows are victims. Ross wrote in a sometimes
illegible scrawl that the people who tormented him killed Michael
Lefkow and Humphrey as much as he did.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who emigrated from Poland and shortened his name, said he
intended to hide until he could kill the judge when he broke into the
house at 6:30 a.m. on Feb. 28. He waited until about 1:15 p.m. before
he gave up. Lefkow found the bodies about four hours later.
</P>
<P>
``Judge Lefkow was No. 1 to kill because she finished me off and
deprived me to live my life through outrageous use of judicial power
and decicration (sic)of the judicial office,'' Ross wrote to WMAQ.
``Judge Lefkow, to her neighbors, is a church-going 'angel.' To me,
Judge Lefkow is a Nazi-style criminal and terrorist.''

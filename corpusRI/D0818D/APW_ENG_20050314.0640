Rambling and threatening letters from the man believed to be the killer of a
federal judge's husband and mother prompted the Illinois Attorney General's
office to investigate him six years ago, former state officials
say.
</P>
<P>
Investigators went to the Chicago home of Bart Ross in the winter of 1999 and
created an extensive file on him, noting his paranoia and anger at the
government and judiciary, said a former investigator and the office's one-time
chief of investigations.
</P>
<P>
Ross, 57, an unemployed electrician, committed suicide Wednesday in a Milwaukee
suburb after a police officer pulled him over because of broken taillights on
his van.
</P>
<P>
After Ross killed himself, authorities found a note implicating himself in the
murders of Michael Lefkow, 64, and Donna Humphrey, 89. They were the husband and
mother of Judge Joan Lefkow.
</P>
<P>
"It pains me to think we had this guy in front of us six years ago with no idea
what evil he was destined to do," said Kerry Polizzi, a former investigator for
the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Callahan, a former chief of investigations for the office, said that
although he knew of the threats Ross made, it is difficult to fault the actions
of the investigators at the time.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing in the correspondence that led us to believe there was going
to be violence," Callahan said. Polizzi said the attorney general's office
receives as many as 100 alarm-raising letters each year.
</P>
<P>
Ross had been treated for cancer at the University of Illinois-Chicago Hospital
from 1992 to 1995 and spent more than a decade attempting to receive damages for
what he said was medical malpractice that had disfigured his
face.
</P>
<P>
Lefkow, a federal judge, had dismissed the most recent of his repeated lawsuits
last year.
</P>
<P>
Ross "was concerned about government conspiracies, his civil rights, and even
accused the hospital of putting a transmitter in his mouth," Polizzi said. He
wrote sometimes incoherent letters to officials at various levels of
government.
</P>
<P>
"There was a file on this, and they received threats from him before," said Dan
Curry, who had been press secretary to then-Attorney General James Ryan at the
time of the 1999 investigation.
</P>
<P>
Curry said he couldn't recall which other public officials received direct
threats.

Man Who Killed Himself Is Linked to Murders of Judge's Kin

An unemployed electrician who shot himself to death
during a traffic stop outside Milwaukee was linked Thursday by DNA
traces and suicide notes to the murders of a federal judge's
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Chicago police superintendent Philip J. Cline said Bart Allan Ross
claimed to have targeted U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow after she
ruled against him in a lawsuit over his cancer treatment. On Feb. 28,
Lefkow's husband and mother were shot to death in their north side
Chicago home.
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday night, police spokesman Matthew Jackson said that
Illinois State Police forensics examiners had linked genetic material
found on a cigarette butt at the Lefkow crime scene to Ross' DNA.
</P>
<P>
``We're satisfied that there is information ... that points to his
having been in the Lefkows' house'' the day of the murders, Cline
said.
</P>
<P>
For the past week, law enforcement officials had been looking into
whether the slayings were the work of white supremacists angry over
another Lefkow ruling.
</P>
<P>
But police and federal authorities said details in the letters
linked Ross to the murders. According to reports in Chicago
newspapers, investigators recovered a box of several hundred
.22-caliber shells similar to spent casings found in the Lefkow house.
The shells and the suicide weapon were being analyzed by forensics
experts, Cline said.
</P>
<P>
Ross, 57, killed himself inside his minivan Wednesday night in West
Allis, Wis., as a policeman approached after observing Ross driving
erratically near a school.
</P>
<P>
``When you read this, I should be dead, so I am writing in the past
tense,'' Ross said in one passage of a rambling note that arrived
Thursday in the mail at an NBC television affiliate in Chicago. ``I
was on my way to Justice.''
</P>
<P>
In debt to creditors, threatened with eviction and armed with
several handguns, Ross wrote that he had been on the road in recent
weeks, living out of his weather-beaten Plymouth minivan and plotting
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
``When I got numb enough to care about nothing, I finally did it,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Lefkow had dismissed Ross' billion-dollar lawsuit, which
alleged that a group of doctors had marred his face and throat during
radiation treatments for cancer.
</P>
<P>
According to West Allis Police Chief Dean Puschnig, a town officer
saw Ross ``writing something down in his vehicle'' moments before he
heard a gun blast.
</P>
<P>
``I thought for sure he was coming out of the van at me,'' said
Police Office Ricky Orlowski Jr.
</P>
<P>
Ross shot himself in the head. Inside the van, investigators found
``some material that led us to believe this man might have a
connection to the Lefkow homicide,'' Puschnig said.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the evidence included munitions and a
suicide note similar to the one received at the TV affiliate. The
documents also reportedly included a hit list of other judges who had
angered Ross, including five members of the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of
Appeals who had upheld Lefkow's ruling.
</P>
<P>
In his hand-scrawled letter to the NBC station, Ross said he broke
into the Lefkow home and hid in a utility room, waiting for the judge
with a ``.22 with a noise reducer relatively quiet and effective.''
</P>
<P>
Ross wrote that he shot the judge's husband, Michael Lefkow, 64,
and mother, Donna Humphrey, 89, when they discovered his hiding place.
Then, he fled.
</P>
<P>
``I regret killing husband and mother of Judge Lefkow as much as I
regret that I have to die for the simple reason that they personally
did to me no wrong,'' Ross wrote in the note to WMAQ.
</P>
<P>
The note described Ross breaking into the Lefkow home at 4:30 a.m.
and hiding in a utility room. His plan was to ``spend all day there
and in the evening, `to get' Judge Lefkow and then others, whoever I
could get.''
</P>
<P>
But when Michael Lefkow found him in the utility room about 9 a.m.,
``I had no choice but to shoot him,'' Ross wrote. ``Then I heard a
voice, `Michael, Michael,' so I looked to the hallway and saw an older
woman.''
</P>
<P>
It was Humphrey. ``I had to shoot her, too. I followed with a
second shot to the head in both cases to minimize their suffering,''
Ross wrote. After he fled, Ross said, he later stalked the homes of
another judge and one of the doctors he sued.
</P>
<P>
During a news conference Thursday at Chicago police headquarters,
officials said there was no evidence suggesting Ross had accomplices
or any ties to the white supremacist group that had been the focus of
the murder investigation in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The group's leader, Matthew Hale, was convicted last year of
soliciting Judge Lefkow's murder; he is due to be sentenced next
month.
</P>
<P>
In a 2002 trademark infringement case, Lefkow had ordered Hale and
his group to stop using the name World Church of the Creator on his
website and in printed material.
</P>
<P>
After a campaign of intimidation -- in which the judge's personal
information and family photographs were posted on racist Web sites --
Hale, 33, was convicted of soliciting her murder.
</P>
<P>
Police and FBI agents questioned Hale, his relatives and supporters
about the Lefkow murders.
</P>
<P>
As federal agents, Chicago detectives and forensic experts in blue
antiseptic suits rummaged through Ross' north side home Thursday,
Cline and other members of the Lefkow task force said they were not
ready to identify him as the presumed killer.
</P>
<P>
``This case is by no means closed,'' said Cline. But the disclosure
late Thursday of the DNA link left only ballistics tests on Ross' gun
and bullets to be completed. Cline also said Ross appears to be the
older man whose face was released on a composite police sketch last
week.

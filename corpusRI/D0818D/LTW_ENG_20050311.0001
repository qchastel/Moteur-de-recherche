The killer broke into U.S. District Judge Joan H.
Lefkow's house and hid in a utility closet. Furious that she had
rejected his rambling lawsuit, he planned to wait until she came home
and then shoot her dead.

But the judge's husband found the man first.

``I had no choice ... but to shoot him,'' Bart Ross wrote in a
suicide note received Thursday by a Chicago television station. ``Then
I heard a voice, `Michael, Michael,' so I looked to the hallway ...
and saw an older woman. I had to shoot her, too.
</P>
<P>
``I followed with a second shot to the head in both cases to
minimize their suffering.''

Chicago police announced Thursday that Ross, who killed himself
with a single shot to the head in a Milwaukee suburb Wednesday night,
is responsible for the Feb. 28 killings of Lefkow's husband, Michael,
and mother, Dorothy Humphrey, a case that sent shudders through the
federal judiciary.

Late Thursday night a Chicago police spokesman confirmed that
Ross's DNA matched evidence found in the Lefkows' house. Police
Superintendent Phil Cline told reporters that letters left by the
electrician, 57, contained details only the killer would know. He also
said a witness saw someone resembling Ross leaving the North Chicago
house on the day of the shootings.

<P>
But Cline emphasized that police are not prepared to make a
definitive statement about all aspects of the case until the evidence
has been analyzed. ``This case is by no means closed,'' he said.

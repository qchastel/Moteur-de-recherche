Jailed Supremacist's Parents Lose Visitation Rights
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The parents of white supremacist Matthew Hale said
Tuesday that their jailhouse visits and phone calls had been suspended
indefinitely as the investigation continues into the killing of a
federal judge's husband and mother.
</P>
<P>
Hale was convicted last year of plotting to murder Judge Joan
Humphrey Lefkow after he lost a trademark infringement case. He is
awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
Russell Hale and his ex-wife, Evelyn Hutcheson, said that they had
been preparing for a bimonthly visit with their son when a counselor
contacted them late Monday and told them not to come.
</P>
<P>
``I was so shook up by it all, I didn't have the sense to ask
why,'' Russell Hale said. Officials with the U.S. attorney's office in
Chicago declined comment.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the Chicago Tribune reported that DNA found on a
cigarette butt inside the Lefkow home -- where the judge found the
bodies -- does not match any family member or any known criminal
profile in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The deaths of Michael F. Lefkow, 64, and Donna Humphrey, 89, have
rocked this city's legal community and raised concerns nationwide
about protection for the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, Lefkow presided over an Oregon group's lawsuit against
Hale and his racially obsessed movement. Lefkow initially ruled in
Hale's favor, but a federal appeals court reversed her. So Lefkow
ordered Hale to stop using World Church of the Creator on his Web site
and in all printed material.
</P>
<P>
Then came two years of taunts -- with the judge's personal
information and family photographs posted on racist Web sites --
before Hale, 33, was convicted of soliciting her murder.
</P>
<P>
Hal Turner, a New Jersey man who hosts a white supremacist
shortwave radio program, had posted on his Web site the names and work
addresses of three appellate court judges connected to Hale's
copyright case.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he removed the material. But he left an electronic link
to a court ruling that lists their names, along with this statement:
``I believe it is time to put the judges named above (in the ruling)
into the arena of public scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III, testifying before the House
Appropriations Committee Tuesday, assured lawmakers that the Lefkow
case would be solved.
</P>
<P>
``We will find them. They will be arrested, and they will do time
for this. We are working 24 hours,'' Mueller said. ``We will leave no
stone unturned, no piece of forensic evidence unanalyzed. Every lead
will be tracked down, and (we) absolutely believe that we will
identify the individual, and that person will be arrested and
prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
The task force dedicated to the case is made up of federal
marshals, FBI agents and Chicago police detectives.
</P>
<P>
The investigation led FBI officials to Michael Lefkow's Chicago law
offices Tuesday, where they questioned staff about past cases.
</P>
<P>
Attorney William Spielberger, who shared office space with Michael
Lefkow, said FBI investigators picked up some address books last week.
He would not say what they asked him about.
</P>
<P>
``They're in there right now, interviewing the secretaries,'' said
Spielberger. ``I looked up to him (Lefkow). He was a mentor in many
ways.''
</P>
<P>
Authorities have not publicly described the evidence they are
collecting. But newspaper accounts have said the items taken from the
Lefkow home include the cigarette butt, a soda can, .22-caliber shell
casings and a bloody shoeprint.

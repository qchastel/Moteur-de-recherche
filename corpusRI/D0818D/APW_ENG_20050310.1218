A man who shot himself to death during a traffic stop in Wisconsin claimed in a
suicide note that he killed a federal judge's husband and mother in Chicago, a
source close to the investigation told The Associated Press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Phil Cline said Thursday that two letters and a witness description
appear to connect Bart Ross to the killing, but he stopped short of calling the
57-year-old Chicago man the sole suspect.
</P>
<P>
Cline said authorities believe Ross was the man a witness had described seeing
near U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow's home the day of the killings.
</P>
<P>
"We're satisfied that there's information in the letter that would point us to
Ross being in Lefkow's house," Cline said.
</P>
<P>
The suicide note was found in Ross' van after he shot himself just outside
Milwaukee, the source told the AP on condition of . Authorities don't know why
he was in the area, about 150 kilometers (100 miles) away from
Chicago.

WMAQ-TV in Chicago said it also received a hand-written note Thursday signed by
a Bart Ross, in which the writer describes breaking into the house of Judge Joan
Humphrey Lefkow around dawn on Feb. 28 with the intent to kill her, the station
reported.
</P>
<P>
Lefkow had ruled against Ross in a civil case involving a medical-malpractice
lawsuit, a ruling that was upheld by a federal appeals court in January. Ross
was also being evicted from his home and had a court date Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cline cautioned that authorities were still searching Ross' Chicago home and
comparing crime evidence to him.
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared at this time to definitely say that any one person in
responsible for these homicides," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lefkow, 61, found the bodies of her husband, attorney Michael Lefkow, 64, and
her mother, Donna Humphrey, 89, on the basement floor of the Lefkow home the
evening of Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
Suspicion immediately turned to white supremacist Matthew Hale, who had been
convicted of soliciting Lefkow's murder after she ruled against him in a
trademark dispute. Investigators insisted, however, that Hale's followers and
other hate groups were just one focus of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
James Finch, head of the Milwaukee FBI office, said Thursday that agents were
not yet scaling back the investigation into the slayings because "we have not
definitively tied this individual to the Lefkow murders."
</P>
<P>
In the letter to WMAQ, Ross said he waited all day in a utility room in the
basement and shot the judge's husband after being discovered. Ross said he then
shot Lefkow's mother after she heard the gunshot and called out to her
son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
"After I shot husband and mother of Judge Lefkow, I had a lot of time to think
about life and death. Killing is no fun, even though I knew I was already dead,"
the station quoted the letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
The suicide note found in the van indicated that Lefkow had ruled against Ross
in a civil case, costing him "his house, his job and family," the Chicago
Tribune reported, citing unidentified sources. The note also included details in
the slayings that were not released to the public, Tribune Deputy Managing
Editor James Warren said in an interview on CNN.
</P>
<P>
Ross was stopped by police in West Allis, Wisconsin, Wednesday evening because
his van had a faulty tail light, police said. As officers approached the car, he
killed himself with a gunshot to the head, police said.

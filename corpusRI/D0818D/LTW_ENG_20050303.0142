2 Men Are Sought in Slayings

<P>
Bearing down with grand jury subpoenas and teams of
interrogators, federal agents and Chicago police sought two men for
questioning Thursday in connection with the execution slayings of a
federal judge's husband and mother, pressing for information from
followers of a white supremacist who insisted from jail that he had no
involvement in the murders.
</P>
<P>
Federal agents seized telephone and computer records from one
residence in the Chicago area and interrogated relatives and
supporters of Matthew Hale, the leader of an extremist faction known
as the World Church of the Creator.
</P>
<P>
Chicago police also released a sketch of two men wanted for
questioning in the crimes and sifted through photographs of Hale's
followers in an attempt to identify the pair -- who reportedly were
spotted in a car parked near the judge's home in the hours before the
murders.
</P>
<P>
Held in virtual isolation in a federal detention facility while
awaiting sentencing for a 2004 federal conviction for trying to
arrange the murder of U.S. District Court Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow,
Hale told his mother in a brief telephone call Thursday that none of
his followers played any part in Monday's murders of Lefkow's
relatives.
</P>
<P>
''There's simply no way that any supporter of mine would commit
such a heinous crime. I totally condemn it,`` Hale told his mother,
Evelyn Hutcheson, in a 15-minute phone conversation that was monitored
and taped by FBI agents. Hutcheson said Hale told her that the day
after the murder he was abruptly moved to a new cell ''that didn't
have anything in it.``
</P>
<P>
Authorities would only say that they are casting a ''wide net`` for
information from anyone connected with Hale, stopping well short of
describing him or any of his supporters as suspects in the case.
</P>
<P>
But according to sources close to the probe and several people
questioned by federal agents, investigators are concentrating on
Hale's relatives and a hard-core group of supporters in Chicago and
his base in East Peoria, Ill. as well as white supremacist
sympathizers as far away as northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
''They're shaking the trees for anyone and anything they can
possibly find,`` said a source familiar with the investigation.
''They're clearly heading down the hate group angle.``
</P>
<P>
The source said investigators were in the process of questioning
Hale supporters who attended his two-week murder solicitation trial
last year.
</P>
<P>
Hale was convicted last April of soliciting his group's ''security
chief`` to kill Judge Lefkow after she enforced a federal appeals
court ruling that forced the ''creativity`` church to change its name.
He is scheduled to be sentenced in April.
</P>
<P>
Hutcheson said Thursday that a team of federal agents who showed up
at her home in East Peoria, Ill., asked her about recent conversations
with Kathleen Robertazzo, a supporter of Hale's whose house in the
north Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates was searched by federal agents
late Wednesday and early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Hutcheson, agents sought Robertazzo's phone records,
searched for firearms and seized the home computer she uses in her
work as a freelance court reporter.
</P>
<P>
Several telephone calls to Robertazzo's home went unanswered, but
Hutcheson said Robertazzo told her agents ''wanted to know why Kathy
and I talk so much. They think Matt's getting his message out in
code.``
</P>
<P>
Under government-enforced restrictions designed to severely curtail
his communication to the outside world, Hale is isolated from other
inmates in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago
and can only speak to his parents by telephone briefly every two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Police gave little background about the sketches they released of
two white men -- one believed to be in his 50s and the other in his
20s -- who were wanted for questioning. Authorities would not say if
they were witnesses or suspects, but the source said investigators
have reviewed photo files of ''creativity`` supporters, looking for
matches.
</P>
<P>
A worker in a nearby church reportedly noticed the two men sitting
in a red Ford Escort idled in a no-parking zone near the Lefkow home,
several hours before the bodies were discovered. The church worker
told police that he told the men they were parked illegally and they
drove off.

</P>
<P>
Chicago Police Chief of Detectives Jim Molloy said the killings
apparently were committed sometime between 10:30 a.m. Monday, when
Donna Humphrey spoke to a granddaughter by phone, and 5:30, when Judge
Lefkow found Humphrey and Michael Lefkow lying dead in the basement.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Judge Lefkow said she
could not say whether the murders of her husband and mother ''has
anything to do with Matt Hale or any of his followers, but I do
believe it was a hit -- not a random thing.``
</P>
<P>
Protected by federal marshals and hidden with her four daughters at
an undisclosed location, Lefkow vowed Wednesday to return to the
bench. ''Nobody is going to intimidate me off my duty,`` she said.
</P>
<P>
In Bergen, N.J., a team of government agents also visited Hal
Turner, the host of a white supremacist radio program that airs on
short-wave frequencies. Turner said the agents, who work for the Joint
Terrorism Task Force in New York, asked him if ''I had any idea who
did this, why they might go after the judge's family.``
</P>
<P>
Turner said he told the agents only: ''I have nothing to say.`` The
phrase is the standard response that white supremacists encourage
their supporters to give to government interrogators.
</P>
<P>
Turner said Thursday that he had provided air time to Hale before
his conviction last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Adam Schupak, associate director of the
Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith in Chicago, Turner
suggested in an April 2003 broadcast that Judge Lefkow was ''worthy of
being killed. It wouldn't be legal in my opinion, but it wouldn't be
wrong.``
</P>
<P>
Turner said Thursday he was not advocating Lefkow's murder. ''If I
had the intent to do something bad, I wouldn't broadcast it,`` Turner
said.

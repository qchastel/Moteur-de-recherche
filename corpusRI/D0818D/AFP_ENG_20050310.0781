CHICAGO, March 10
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The investigation into the 
execution-style slaying of a Chicago federal judges husband and 
mother took a surprising turn Thursday when police said that a man 
who killed himself during a traffic stop was now a prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
Suspicion had earlier been focused on a neo-Nazi and white 
supremacist group whose leader had previously threatened the 
61-year-old judge.
</P>
<P>
Police have identified the suspect as Bart Ross, a loner with no 
apparent links to the white supremacist group.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Michael Lefkow, 64, and Donna Grace Humphrey, 89, were 
discovered by district court judge Joan Lefkow in her suburban 
Edgewater home after she returned from work on February 28. Both had 
been shot in the head in the basement of the house.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, a local television station received a 
rambling, handwritten note signed Bart A. Ross in which the writer 
confessed to killing Lefkow and Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
It arrived in the newsroom after a man identified as Bart Ross 
shot himself when his brown minivan was pulled over Wednesday in a 
Milwaukee suburb about 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of where the 
slaying took place.
</P>
<P>
Chicago police said a note was discovered in the vehicle in 
which Ross implicated himself in the murder.
</P>
<P>
In the letter addressed to the television station, the writer 
said that he broke into the Lefkow home because he wanted "to get 
Judge Lefkow and them others, whoever I could get."
</P>
<P>
According to the authorities, Judge Lefkow had dismissed a 
medical malpractice suit filed by Ross a number of years ago.
</P>
<P>
After he was discovered in his hiding spot in the utility room, 
the author of the letter said he "had no choice" but to shoot 
Michael Lefkow in the back of the head. He then went on to describe 
shooting Humphrey after she called out "Michael, Michael" and came 
looking for her son-in-law at the sound of the shots.
</P>
<P>
The author gave several reasons why he wanted to kill the 
judge.
</P>
<P>
"Judge Lefkow was No. 1 to kill because she finished me off and 
deprived me to live my life through outrageous abuse of judicial 
power and decicration (sic) of the judicial office. Judge Lefkow, to 
her neighbors, is a church going 'angel'. To me, Judge Lefkow is a 
Nazi-style criminal and terrorist," the author wrote.
</P>
<P>
The writer also mentioned two other people he intended to kill 
in retribution for the problems hed had with the medical malpractice 
suit.
</P>
<P>
Police said they have not yet confirmed that Ross was the 
killer.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that there is plenty of information out there 
pointing to this individual as a possible offender," said Chicago 
Police Superintendent Philip Cline. "However, only a complete and 
total analysis of all the evidence will point us in any one 
direction."

Ivory-Billed Woodpecker Is Spotted After Long Absence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ivory-billed woodpecker, long thought to have been pushed into
extinction by massive logging of the American Southeast, has been
spotted by scientists for the first time in 60 years soaring through
the wild swamplands of southern Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of the bird, one of the world's largest
woodpeckers, has long been held up as a symbol of the disappearance of
the American wilderness. Its reappearance was hailed today as a
validation of efforts to preserve and restore forested areas
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
``This is huge,'' said Frank Gill, a former president of the
Audubon Society. ``It's kind of like finding Elvis.''
</P>
<P>
Reports of sightings have appeared sporadically since the last
confirmed appearance of the bird in 1944, but researchers generally
have dismissed the reports as the overenthusiastic imaginings of
amateurs.
</P>
<P>
The new conclusion that the species is still extant is based on at
least eight separate sightings in the last year -- many of them by
experienced ornithologists -- and a video captured by David Luneau of
the University of Arkansas, Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
``The bird captured on video is clearly an ivory-billed
woodpecker,'' said ornithologist John Weaver Fitzpatrick of Cornell
University, who reported the finding with his colleagues Thursday in
the online version of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
The bird is hard to misidentify. It has a three-foot wingspan, is
19 to 21 inches long, and has distinctive black-and-white markings.
They are second in size only to the imperial woodpecker of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Gale Norton called the find an ``exciting
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
``Second chances to save wildlife once thought to be extinct are
rare,'' she said at a news conference Thursday, where she announced
$10 million in new funds to bolster restoration of the Big Woods of
southern Arkansas, where the bird was spotted.
</P>
<P>
Biologist E. O. Wilson called them ``the signature bird'' of the
southern coastal plain.
</P>
<P>
Males have a red crest, while females have a black head and crest.
White wing patches and a stripe down the side of the head and
continuing down its back distinguish the ivory-billed bird from the
pileated woodpecker, which is nearly as large and much more abundant.
The birds also have a large, light-colored, chisel-tipped bill; the
pileated woodpecker has a much darker bill.
</P>
<P>
Dead trees provide nesting sites and food. The birds remove bark by
pecking at it with their characteristic double-tap drumming -- which
researchers also have heard frequently in the Big Woods area. Females
lay a clutch of three to four eggs, for which the males assume sole
responsibility at night.
</P>
<P>
A nesting pair require about three square miles of forest for
sustenance, so that even when the birds were widespread, their
populations were never dense.
</P>
<P>
The creature is sometimes called the ``Lord, God bird,''
Fitzpatrick said Thursday. ``It's such a striking bird that, when
people would see it, they would say, `Lord, God, what a woodpecker!'''
</P>
<P>
The current surge of interest began on Feb. 11, 2004, when amateur
ornithologist Gene M. Sparling III of Hot Springs, Ark., saw what he
thought was an ivory-billed woodpecker while kayaking in the Cache
River National Wildlife Refuge and reported it to a bird watchers' Web
site.
</P>
<P>
A week later, Tim W. Gallagher of Cornell and Bobby R. Harrison of
Oakwood College in Huntsville, Ala., interviewed him and were so
impressed by his account that they accompanied him on a second trip.
On Feb. 27, a large black-and-white woodpecker flew less than 70 feet
in front of their canoe on the bayou. Both simultaneously cried out,
``Ivory-bill!''
</P>
<P>
Researchers then organized several bird-watching expeditions,
spending a total of more than 7,000 hours seeking sightings. They had
six, all of which were too fleeting for photography. Ultimately,
Luneau reasoned that their best bet was to leave a video camera
running constantly and he captured four seconds of footage showing the
bird taking off from the trunk of a tupelo tree.
</P>
<P>
Scientists do not know how many ivory-billed woodpeckers there are
in the region or whether they have actually seen many or just one
male. Because the lifespan is only about 16 years, Fitzpatrick
speculated that there is at least one breeding pair.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said that the Big Woods area has been in the process of
restoration for several years and is now about 40 percent along the
way toward maturity. Restoration has probably provided new food and
nesting sites for what might have been a very small group of the
birds, allowing their numbers to expand to a point where they began to
come in contact with humans.

BIRDERS HEAR ELUSIVE CALL, SUGGESTING WOODPECKER
</HEADLINE>

SANTA BARBARA, Calif.,
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For half a century, bird-watchers have longed
for a glimpse of the ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird long
given up for extinct but recently rediscovered in Arkansas. Now
they may be able to hear it.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, at the annual meeting of the American Ornithologists' Union
here, a Cornell researcher played newly recorded sounds that were
believed to come from an ivory bill: a toy-trumpet call
sounding like the word "kent" and a double knock on
wood, made when the woodpecker hammers a tree.
</P>
<P>
It was these sounds that persuaded some skeptics this month to
withdraw a critical paper and state that they were now
convinced of the bird's existence.
</P>
<P>
The sounds are online at the Web site of the Cornell
Lab of Ornithology: www.birds.cornell.edu.
</P>
<P>
Russ A. Charif, a research biologist at the lab who played
the sounds at the meeting, did not claim that they
were conclusive proof of the bird's existence. There is further
analysis to do and more acoustical evidence to gather, Charif
said.
</P>
<P>
But together with a blurred, heavily analyzed video, and personal sightings,
the evidence for the bird's existence is now conclusive, he
said.
</P>
<P>
John Fitzpatrick, the head of the Cornell lab, said after the
presentation that the researchers were not retreating from their conclusion
that at least one ivory bill existed in Arkansas, that
it was the weight of the combined evidence that had
convinced him.
</P>
<P>
The ivory-billed woodpecker, the largest American woodpecker, starkly patterned in black,
white and red, had acquired near mythical status as a
reminder of lost Southern forests until it was sighted twice
in February 2004 in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
Although other sightings had been made since the last documented one
-- roughly 50 years ago in Louisiana -- none had
been confirmed and accepted by ornithologists.
</P>
<P>
In 2004 an ivory bill was sighted by Timothy Gallagher of
the Cornell lab and Bobby Harrison of Oakwood College in
Huntsville, Ala., as they searched the Cache River refuge in
a canoe. Both men had been pursuing the bird for
years and had gone to this area because of a
report from Gene Sparling of Hot Springs, Ark., who thought
he had seen it while kayaking earlier in the month.
</P>
<P>
The sighting by two expert birders led to an extensive but
secret search and an announcement in April 2005 at a
news conference and in an article in the journal Science
that the bird had been found.
</P>
<P>
Serious doubts were later voiced by other ornithologists and birders, including
Richard O. Prum of Yale University and Mark Robbins of
the University of Kansas about the evidence presented in the
Science paper.
</P>
<P>
But Prum and Robbins were convinced of the bird's existence after
they were provided the recordings that Charif played on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The recordings were from the Cache River and the White River
National Wildlife Refuges, and Prum and Robbins were still not
convinced that the Science paper, which had not used the
recordings as evidence, was conclusive. But since the larger point
was moot, they withdrew a critical response to that paper.
</P>
<P>
Charif said after his talk that the "kent" sounds alone were
not conclusive because scientists could not completely rule out a
blue jay mimicking the sound of an ivory bill, and
that there was no earlier definitive recording of the double
rap.
</P>
<P>
"Our interpretation is that they provide suggesting and tantalizing evidence," he
said of the recordings.
</P>
<P>
"We regard the video as being conclusive," he said, even though
it was the acoustic recordings that had persuaded skeptics who
found the video analysis lacking.
</P>
<P>
The recordings were made from December 2004 to May 2005 with
remote recording units in the Cache River and White River
refuges.
</P>
<P>
The 18,000 hours of recordings were combed, first by computer and
then by humans, to pick out more than 50 double
knocks and several "kent" calls.
</P>
<P>
These were more thoroughly analyzed and compared to known ivory bill
recordings, and double knocks of similar species outside of the
United States.

WOODPECKER 'REDISCOVERY' SETS BIRDERS ALL ATWITTER

<P>
For nearly 60 years, bird lovers have slogged through
the swampwaters of the Deep South, along the bayous and
rivers feeding the Mississippi River, searching in vain for a
spectacular bird long thought to be extinct -- the ivory-billed
woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
In news bound to electrify bird lovers worldwide, scientists are expected
to announce today the "rediscovery" of the ivory-bill in a
remote swampy area of northeast Arkansas known as the Big
Woods.
</P>
<P>
At least one male ivory-bill has been found alive and well
in the deep forest of bottomland hardwoods between Little Rock
and Memphis. It is the first confirmed sighting of the
long-sought bird since World War II.
</P>
<P>
Other ivory-bills are presumed to be living there. For thousands of
birding enthusiasts, the confirmation of a sighting will be a
dream come true.
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible news," said Steve R. Runnels, president of the American
Birding Association. "This is the most exciting ornithological discovery in
a long, long time."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Interior Secretary Gale Norton and officials with the Nature Conservancy,
the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission are scheduled
to make the announcement in Washington this morning.
</P>
<P>
'Dramatic rediscovery'
</P>
<P>
The Interior Department touted the event as "the dramatic rediscovery of
a species previously believed extinct."
</P>
<P>
The on-line edition of Science magazine is expected to publish today
a detailed account of the woodpecker's rediscovery.
</P>
<P>
As word about the woodpecker leaked out, birder chat lines were
buzzing and calls poured in to birding organizations.
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday afternoon, Mary Scott, an Arizona birding enthusiast who has
pursued the ivory-billed woodpecker for years, posted on the Internet
an account of her personal encounter with the bird in
Arkansas. She said her sighting two years ago of the
white-striped woodpecker with a crested crown helped spur scientists and
conservation officials to come to Arkansas and confirm that the
bird, indeed, is living there.
</P>
<P>
"For me, the search for the ivory-billed woodpecker has ended," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The moment she first saw the bird was unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
"The sight was overwhelming," she recalled. "It was huge, and was
hanging from the trunk of the tree."
</P>
<P>
She insisted the exact location be kept secret to prevent hordes
of birdwatchers from thundering into the area, eager to add
an ivory-bill sighting to their "life lists" of species they
have seen.
</P>
<P>
Runnels agreed the location should not be revealed. "It would be
a nightmare with all the people trying to see the
bird," he said.
</P>
<P>
Larger than a crow, the ivory-billed woodpecker was -- and perhaps
still is -- at 20 inches the largest woodpecker in
North America. Its call, say those who have heard it,
is a nasal "kent-kent-kent," what some say is like the
sound of a child's tin horn.
</P>
<P>
The bird once ranged from Texas to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Most experts believe the woodpecker became extinct in the United States
because its habitats of old-growth forest and bottomland swamps were
felled for timber and drained, its rich soils planted in
cotton and soybeans or the land developed. One of the
last places the bird had been seen was along the
Altamaha River in Georgia in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted a futile five-year search
in Georgia and other Southern states in the 1980s. Reliable
sightings of a subspecies of ivory-bill in Cuba were reported
in 1986, but information since then has been sketchy.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, a research team embarked on a 30-day expedition in
the Louisiana-Mississippi Pearl River Wildlife Management Area, about an hour's
drive from New Orleans, to try to find the woodpecker.
The researchers were acting on a reported sighting by Louisiana
State University forestry student David Kulivan in April 1999. The
bird was never tracked down.
</P>
<P>
Intriguing mystery
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the ivory-bill's rarity, beauty and the intriguing mystery
of whether it survives have captured the imaginations of bird
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
Former President Theodore Roosevelt, who hunted in the Mississippi River woodlands,
once wrote that "the great ivory-billed woodpecker . . .
seemed to me to set off the wilderness of the
swamp as much as the beasts of the chase."
</P>
<P>
Confirming the bird's identity has been complicated by its resemblance to
a close cousin -- the pileated woodpecker. The pileated is
smaller and its markings are a bit different.
</P>
<P>
While perching, the back of a pileated is solid black, while
a perched ivory-bill sports large patches of white in the
form of a shield on the lower back.
</P>
<P>
"It will take a lot to convince me that they have
found the ivory-billed woodpecker," said Gary Lester, head of Louisiana's
Natural Heritage Program, who took part in the 2002 search.

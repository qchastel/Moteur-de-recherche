More than 30 bird experts now spend each day in
the swampy forests of eastern Arkansas, tying audio and video
recording devices onto tree trunks, paddling quietly in canoes, and
sitting on camouflaged wooden platforms near ancient cypresses, just
waiting for the rare ivory-billed woodpecker to appear.
</P>
<P>
More than six months after scientists announced to the world that
they had rediscovered the presumed-extinct bird, they are in the midst
of an unprecedented search for the icon. It is a campaign that could
transform the nation's conservation debate, and it has already altered
the small town adjoining the bird's natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
``We've got all the people, the equipment in place, now all we need
is a little luck,'' said Ken Levenstein, crew leader for the 22
scientists who are searching full time for the woodpecker until the
end of April 2006 along with a rotating group of 112 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
A group of bird researchers -- including officials from the Cornell
Lab of Ornithology, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arkansas
Game and Fish Commission, and the Nature Conservancy -- electrified
birders in late April when they declared the ivory-billed woodpecker
had survived undetected in the Big Woods, more than half a million
acres of bottomland hardwood forest an hour's drive from Little Rock.
In February 2004 Gene Sparling, a local birder, first saw the
woodpecker, which had not been seen conclusively since 1944, and in
the ensuing year other researchers spotted it and captured it on film
in a blurry four-second videotape.
</P>
<P>
``It's given us a renewed hope that all these efforts, all this
work, can pay off,'' said Sam D. Hamilton, Southeast regional director
for Fish and Wildlife. ``It's the story of how you can get a second
chance.''
</P>
<P>
Hamilton and other conservationists are anxious to show that the
recent sightings are not an aberration but proof that preserving and
restoring habitat can sustain some of the nation's most prized
species. While scientists have recorded the bird's telltale double
knock over the past year and have spotted it more than half a dozen
times, no one has produced the kind of precise photo that could win
over skeptics.
</P>
<P>
``Nobody seems to be able to whip out a camera fast enough,''
Hamilton said, adding that many Americans may soon lose their appetite
for funding the bird's recovery without more conclusive proof. ``We
live in a fast-moving society, with short memories.''
</P>
<P>
At the moment, advocates of the red-crowned bird that helped
inspire the cartoon character Woody Woodpecker are pouring enormous
sums into locating it and preserving its environs. Federal authorities
have provided $10.2 million toward the effort, and the Nature
Conservancy has bought 18,500 acres of Big Woods habitat to set aside
for the bird since its rediscovery.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the bird lives in the Mississippi Delta region,
which includes parts of Arkansas' Cache and White rivers. State and
federal lands comprise 300,000 acres of the woodpecker's habitat, but
the government wants to buy 220,000 more acres in the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials, working with local wildlife hunters, already had
begun restoring the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge where the
bird was found last year. Dennis Widner, who has managed the refuge
since its inception, started planting native bottomland hardwoods from
acorns in 1988 and hopes to plant hundreds of thousands more trees in
an effort to reconnect the bird's fragmented habitat.
</P>
<P>
``It's like a jigsaw puzzle you're putting together,'' Widner said.
``But it's a jigsaw puzzle you won't finish for the next hundred
years.''
</P>
<P>
But scientists such as Cornell's Ron Rohrbaugh, who directs the
ivory-billed woodpecker research project, have a more urgent task.
Rohrbaugh lists it at the top of his PowerPoint presentation on the
group's objectives: ``Relocate the bird and obtain irrefutable
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
This is a challenge. The bird's range spans as much as 10.4 square
miles, making it a bit like ``a flying needle in a haystack,'' as the
late expert James Tanner put it. Sam Stuart, a 25-year-old volunteer
from Phoenixville, Pa., who arrived in Brinkley on Dec. 5, said that
after a week in the woods, he now grasps the difficulty of the search.
</P>
<P>
``We all felt like we were going to come down and find it right
away,'' Stuart said. ``Then you see the enormity of the forest.''
</P>
<P>
Other researchers have tried to find presumed-extinct species in
the past: Some believe the Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey remains
alive in Ivory Coast, and experts continue to search for the elusive
thylacine, or Tasmanian wolf. But few expeditions compare in size or
expense to the current woodpecker mission.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, local residents -- who spent years welcoming duck
and deer hunters to their area -- are hoping to capitalize on their
small town's newfound birding fame.
</P>
<P>
Gene Depriest, owner of Gene's Bar-B-Que, has erected a flashing
sign outside his restaurant that declares ``The Bird is the Word!
Welcome Bird Watchers! T-Shirts!'' He has put both an ``Ivory Bill
Burger'' (two hamburger patties, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes on a
sesame-seed bun) and an ``Ivory Bill Hot Fudge Brownie'' (a brownie
with whipped cream and a cherry) on the menu, and sales have increased
25 percent since this spring's announcement.
</P>
<P>
``I sell a lot of those burgers, especially to people from out of
town,'' said Priest, who gives customers a custom-signed ``Ivory Bill
Burger'' certificate if they opt for the $5.75 dish. ``It's really
helped business, I tell you that.''

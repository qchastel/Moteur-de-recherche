<P>
Experts have rediscovered the Ivory 
billed woodpecker in the United States 61 years after it was put on 
the extinct list and the government said Thursday that 10 million 
dollars would be spent to make sure it stays alive.
</P>
<P>
Ornitholigists said several sightings of the bird had been made 
in a refuge in Arkansas state and video of the bird made last year 
was released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 experts and biologists took part in an operation to 
find the bird again after the initial sighting was made by a kayaker 
on the White River in eastern Arkansas, National Public Radio (NPR) 
reported.
</P>
<P>
It was last sighted in 1944 and was thought to have fallen 
victim of widespread logging in the region.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in New York 
and The Nature Conservancy kept the woodpecker's existence a secret 
for more than a year to allow time to protect the bird's habitat in 
the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy and federal agencies have been buying 
land in the district to better protect the bird's habitat.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Department and the Department of Agriculture said 
they would spend more than 10 million dollars to protect the Ivory 
billed woodpecker, a large, showy bird with a red head and cream 
coloured bill.
</P>
<P>
Private groups and individuals have already committed about 10 
million dollars to buy land and research the woodpecker's habitat.
</P>
<P>
"This is a rare second chance to preserve through cooperative 
conservation what was once thought lost forever," said Interior 
Secretary Gale Norton.

Woodpecker Thought Extinct Cheers Many by Resurfacing
</HEADLINE>

After decades of legends, rumors and anecdotes, scientists Thursday
announced something of an ornithological miracle: multiple confirmed
sightings of the ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird whose last confirmed
sighting dates back to World War II.
</P>
<P>
Visual encounters, a blurry video clip, and the woodpecker's
distinctive ``double-knock'' drumming have convinced a group of 16
researchers that a bird long believed extinct still resides within the
Big Woods region of eastern Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
``Through the 20th century, it's literally been every birder's
fantasy to see this bird,'' said John Fitzpatrick, director of the
Cornell Lab of Ornithology and a co-author of the study, published
Thursday in an online edition of the journal Science. ``This is really
the Holy Grail for birds.''
</P>
<P>
Or the ornithological equivalent of seeing Elvis, as some birders
have termed it. Rarely seen after the mid-1800s, the largest
woodpecker in North America was believed to have gone extinct after
deforestation decimated its habitat in the swampy woodlands of the
South. The last known individual, a female, was last documented in a
logged tract of northeastern Louisiana in 1944.
</P>
<P>
``It's legendary, it's mysterious, it has been a majestic symbol of
America's South,'' Fitzpatrick said in explaining the bird's superstar
status.
</P>
<P>
In February 2004, Hot Springs naturalist Gene Sparling III spotted
an unusually large woodpecker while kayaking in the 550,000-acre Cache
River National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Arkansas. His posting on a
Web site attracted the attention of ornithologists, who eventually
launched multiple expeditions to the site.
</P>
<P>
Scientists used video footage from another observer and at least
eight eyewitness accounts to rule out the superficially similar
pileated woodpecker. Sherman Suter, an editor at Science, said
reviewers and editors ``overwhelmingly agreed'' that the evidence was
solid.
</P>
<P>
Despite the report, scientists cannot rule out the possibility that
all of their encounters involved the same red-crested male.
Nevertheless, Fitzpatrick said the presence of at least one bird
strongly suggests the presence of more.
</P>
<P>
``The life span of a woodpecker rarely exceeds 15 years, and would
never hit 20,'' he said. ``That means that there's breeding activity
long after everyone thought this bird was gone.''
</P>
<P>
News of the find buoyed naturalists across the country.
</P>
<P>
``Incredible! Unbelievable! There's no bigger bird story than
this,'' said E.J. McAdams, executive director of New York City
Audubon.
</P>
<P>
M. David Luneau Jr., a professor at the University of Arkansas at
Little Rock who captured the crucial video footage, explained why the
woodpecker is sometimes called the `Lord God' bird: ``When people
would see it, they would utter, `Lord God, what a bird!' ''
</P>
<P>
Long Island resident Virginia Eckelberry, 91, recalled how her late
husband, renowned bird illustrator Don. R. Eckelberry, expressed awe
over his own ``spectacular'' encounters with the woodpecker in 1944 -
the last official sighting in the United States. The wildlife artist,
who died in 2001, would have expressed skepticism over Thursday's
news, his wife said - so many people have wanted to see the bird so
badly, after all.
</P>
<P>
``If this one has managed to live unnoticed for all these years, it
would seem like it would be a miracle,'' she said. ``It would be the
best news ever.''
</P>
<P>
Frank Gill, the National Audubon Society's senior ornithologist,
said he views the discovery as a rallying cry for naturalists who had
all but given up hope on the bird and an equally elusive Cuban
subspecies.
</P>
<P>
As for the future, no one can yet say. But for ornithologists, the
present feels pretty good.
</P>
<P>
``There is no birder in America,'' Fitzpatrick said, ``who doesn't
feel a certain hair standing up on the back of the neck at the thought
that this bird could still be around.''

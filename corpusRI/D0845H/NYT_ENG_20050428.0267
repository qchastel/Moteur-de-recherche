GOVERNMENT MOVES TO PROTECT IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER

While jubilant bird lovers rejoiced Thursday over the "rediscovery"
of the fabled ivory-billed woodpecker, the government promised to spend
millions of dollars to protect the bird and its habitat,
a remote Arkansas swamp.
</P>
<P>
"Second chances to save wildlife once thought to be extinct are
rare," said Interior Secretary Gale Norton. "We will take advantage
of this opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Sam Hamilton, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regional
office in Atlanta, will head a team of wildlife experts
to develop a plan to protect the ivory-bill and increase
its numbers.
</P>
<P>
A striking, hefty bird, Campephilus principalis was last seen in 1944
and was feared vanished forever.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said that one of his first priorities was to bolster
law enforcement in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in
northeast Arkansas, midway between Little Rock and Memphis, because of
an expected influx of people wanting to see the bird.
At least one male of the species was seen there
several times -- and caught on videotape -- during the
past year. Scientists said perhaps two dozen or more of
the birds live in the dense forest.
</P>
<P>
The Cache River refuge is part of a larger swath known
as the Big Woods -- 550,000 acres of bayou, bottomland
forests and oxbow lakes.
</P>
<P>
"Our immediate concern now is to make sure that the bird
and the area it occupies are protected," Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his team would develop a plan as soon
as possible to accommodate the thousands of bird enthusiasts who
will want to visit the bottomland swamp forest to catch
a glimpse of the long-missing woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
Norton, however, issued a plea for the public "not to love
this bird to death." She said that the departments of
Interior and Agriculture propose spending more than $10 million to
protect the bird. Private groups and contributors will give another
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
Norton and officials with the Nature Conservancy, Cornell Lab of Ornithology,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Arkansas Game and Fish
Commission announced the discovery in Washington. The online edition of
Science magazine also published a detailed account of finding the
bird.
</P>
<P>
Video of the 20-inch bird's 3-foot wingspan and distinctive black-and-white markings
confirmed that it was not extinct, as long feared.
</P>
<P>
"The bird captured on video is clearly an ivory-billed woodpecker," said
John Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell lab and lead author
of the Science article. "Amazingly, America may have another chance
to protect the future of this spectacular bird and the
awesome forests in which it lives."
</P>
<P>
He and other scientists said that other ivory-bills, whose life span
is about 15 years, undoubtedly are living in the deep
emerald forests of the Big Woods area.
</P>
<P>
Mary Scott, an Arizona birding enthusiast who has pursued the ivory-bill
for years, said this week that she saw the bird
two years ago and reported her sightings to the Cornell
lab and other groups.
</P>
<P>
But Cornell officials said the search for the bird began in
earnest in February 2004, after a kayaker, Gene Sparling of
Hot Springs, Ark., saw an unusually large, red-crested woodpecker fly
toward him and land on a nearby tree. He noticed
several field markings suggesting the bird was an ivory-bill.
</P>
<P>
Based on Sparling's report, two other experts, Tim Gallagher of the
Cornell Lab and Bobby Harrison of Oakwood College in Huntsville,
Ala., went with Sparling into the bayou where the bird
was seen. As the three paddled in the waterway, a
large black-and-white woodpecker flew less than 70 feet away.
</P>
<P>
"Ivory-bill," cried out Gallagher and Harrison, who quickly went ashore to
sketch what they had seen. Their field sketches show the
species' characteristic wing patterns of white and black.
</P>
<P>
"When we finished our notes," Gallagher said, "Bobby sat down on
a log, put his face in his hands and began
to sob, saying, 'I saw an ivory-bill. I saw an
ivory-bill."'
</P>
<P>
Gallagher said he was too choked with emotion to speak.
</P>
<P>
"Just to think this bird made it into the 21st century
gives me chills," he said. "It's like a funeral shroud
has been pulled back, giving us a glimpse of a
living bird, rising Lazarus-like from the grave."
</P>
<P>
The sightings led to the formation of a search team, which
became the Big Woods Conservation Partnership. Later, three searchers spied
an ivory-bill in the refuge. The fleeting views left little
chance for photographs.
</P>
<P>
David Lunea of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock said
the best way to record the bird was to have
a camcorder at all times. He captured four seconds of
video footage showing an ivory-bill taking off from a tupelo
tree trunk.

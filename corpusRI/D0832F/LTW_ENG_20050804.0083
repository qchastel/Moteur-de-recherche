Former OPM Chief Finds Private Sector Has Its Hazards
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

When Kay Coles James left her job as director of the
Office of Personnel Management Jan. 31, her story resembled that of a
hundred other political appointees headed out the revolving door of
government. Now it's a case study of the potential perils of cashing
in.
</P>
<P>
James, 56, appeared to be the kind of well-connected player who
could quickly land a lucrative private-sector post and glide back into
government when the right opportunity came along. Her resume includes
stints as a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, senior vice
president of the Family Research Council and a Cabinet secretary for
then-Virginia Gov. George Allen, R.
</P>
<P>
But James chose poorly.
</P>
<P>
On May 3, MZM Inc., a small and relatively unknown defense and
intelligence contractor, announced that it had hired James as a senior
executive vice president for national security transformation.
</P>
<P>
``Ms. James brings with her a wealth of tested expertise
demonstrated over twenty years in public service,'' MZM President
Mitchell Wade said in news release trumpeting the hire. ``We look
forward to Ms. James providing the same quality leadership for the
employees and clients of MZM Inc. as she has so successfully
demonstrated on behalf of our country.''
</P>
<P>
The company needed more than James could offer.
</P>
<P>
By June, MZM was under federal scrutiny after reports that Wade
bought the home of Rep. Randall ``Duke'' Cunningham, R-Calif., in 2003
and sold it for a $700,000 loss. Wade also allowed the lawmaker to
stay on his yacht rent-free. Investigators searched MZM's
headquarters, as well as Wade's and Cunningham's homes. Cunningham
announced last month that he will not seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
Wade stepped down as chief executive and president of MZM. In the
ensuing management shuffle, James briefly became the chief operating
officer. But in July the company issued a statement saying that James
and another executive had ``voluntarily resigned'' on June 24.
</P>
<P>
All in all, it wasn't the softest landing for a former presidential
appointee.
</P>
<P>
Down but not out, James remains a member of the board of directors
of Amerigroup Corp., a Virginia Beach, Va.-based managed health care
provider. And on July 8, Health and Human Services Secretary Mike
Leavitt named her to a 28-member advisory commission that will search
for ways to stabilize and strengthen Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
Kent Jenkins, a spokesman, said Amerigroup was ``lucky'' to have
James. ``She's being sought after by a number of corporations for
board seats,'' he said. ``She's extremely knowledgeable in a lot of
critical areas. This other business aside, she already is extremely
busy.''

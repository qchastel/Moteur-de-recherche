Former congressman Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham,
R-Calif., wore a listening device as part of his cooperation with
federal prosecutors before pleading guilty to taking $2.4 million in
bribes in November, Time magazine reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Time said that it is unclear who might have been targeted for
electronic monitoring by Cunningham but that the topic ``is the source
of furious -- and nervous -- speculation by congressional Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
The magazine, citing unidentified sources, said the recording took
place ``at some point during the short interval'' between Cunningham's
agreement to cooperate with prosecutors and his Nov. 28 guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's attorney, K. Lee Blalack, declined to comment to The
Washington Post Friday, saying he would not disclose what the former
congressmen ``has or hasn't done'' to meet his pledge to cooperate
with the government.
</P>
<P>
Sanjay Bhandari of the San Diego U.S. attorney's office, which is
leading the probe of Cunningham, also declined to comment on the
report.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, an eight-term representative and decorated former
fighter pilot, tearfully resigned from Congress after admitting that
he took millions in bribes from defense contractors -- including cash,
house payments, a Rolls-Royce, a yacht and a 19th-century
Louis-Philippe commode.
</P>
<P>
The FBI is still conducting its investigation of defense
contractors and others tied to the former lawmaker.

Lawmaker Asks to Use Donations for Defense

Rep. Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, R-Calif., is asking
his contributors -- including the Washington defense contractor at the
center of a federal grand jury probe -- for permission to use their
campaign donations to pay for his legal defense.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham announced last month that he is not running for
re-election because of the investigation, which focuses on his
relationship with Mitchell Wade, founder of MZM Inc. The company has
worked on several Pentagon intelligence programs that Cunningham
supported as a member of the House intelligence and appropriations
committees.

In letters that went to Wade and other donors earlier this month,
the congressman said the government investigation could last well into
next year and that his legal expenses ``could exceed a million or more
dollars.'' Cunningham's campaign fund had $672,115 in cash at the end
of June. The Federal Election Commission has approved similar requests
to use campaign donations to pay legal bills.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Cunningham is setting up a legal expense trust, which
will permit him to accept as much as $5,000 a year from individual and
corporate donors.
</P>
<P>
Investigators last month searched the homes of both men, as well as
Wade's office and his yacht on the Potomac River, where Cunningham had
lived rent-free for more than a year. The inquiry began after the San
Diego Union-Tribune reported in June that Wade had bought the
congressman's home in late 2003 and sold it several months later at a
$700,000 loss. Wade and his wife, Christiane Wade, donated $12,000 to
Cunningham between 2001 and last fall.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham told his donors that if they objected to their money
paying his legal expenses, he would donate it to the House GOP
campaign committee. Mark Olson, a Cunningham spokesman, said any donor
who asks for a refund will get one.

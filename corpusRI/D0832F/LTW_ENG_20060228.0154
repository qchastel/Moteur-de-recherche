Prosecutors Keep Cunningham Sentence Recommendation

<P>
Federal prosecutors Tuesday reaffirmed their
recommendation that disgraced ex-congressman Randall ``Duke''
Cunningham be sentenced to 10 years in prison, rejecting his bid for a
lighter penalty because he is a war hero.
</P>
<P>
In a 14-page report, three assistant U.S. attorneys noted that an
appellate court rejected leniency for a Vietnam veteran because of his
heroism during the My Lai massacre.
</P>
<P>
The filing sets the stage for a decision Friday by U.S. District
Court Judge Larry Burns.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, a Rancho Santa Fe Republican, has pleaded guilty to
taking $2.4 million in bribes and evading more than $1 million in
taxes.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors -- Sanjay Bhandari, Jason Forge, and Phillip L.B.
Halpern -- said that Cunningham ``bullied and hectored'' Pentagon
officials to award contracts to the defense contractors who had bribed
him. Cunningham's only motivation ``was to ensure that his
co-conspirators gorged themselves at the national trough, regardless
of the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's attorneys have argued that Burns should consider
Cunningham's record as a decorated fighter pilot during the Vietnam
War ``when he saved the lives of his fellow Americans at great risk to
his own.''
</P>
<P>
Awarded the Navy Cross, the service's second-highest medal for
bravery, Cunningham later taught at the renowned Top Gun school. His
fame, which was boosted by the 1986 movie ``Top Gun'' starring Tom
Cruise, propelled him into politics.
</P>
<P>
But the prosecutors noted that Cunningham's last display of heroism
``was three decades ago'' and that his crimes were part of a scheme to
enrich himself by exploiting his membership on congressional
committees dedicated to national security.
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old Cunningham resigned from Congress in the middle of
his eighth term after pleading guilty in November.
</P>
<P>
His attorneys -- K. Lee Blalack, Mark Holscher and Kristina M.
Hersey -- argued in a filing last week that a six-year sentence is
more appropriate, given Cunningham's war record, his lack of criminal
background, and his advanced age and declining health. Cunningham has
undergone surgery for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
``If Mr. Cunningham is sentenced to six years in jail, the United
States can rightly boast that it secured an unprecedented, even
historic, punishment,'' Cunningham's attorneys argued.
</P>
<P>
No member of Congress convicted of corruption has ever received a
sentence as high as six years, the defense attorneys wrote, adding
that a 10-year sentence would probably be a ``death sentence'' but six
years would allow him ``a few short years'' with his family.
</P>
<P>
As part of his plea agreement, the prosecution agreed not to seek a
prison sentence of more than 10 years. In that agreement, Cunningham
pledged to help with the prosecution of his four unnamed
co-conspirators.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, in their filing, said that Cunningham could have
received a sentence of more than 20 years without the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
Last week, defense contractor Mitchell Wade pleaded guilty to
bribing Cunningham with more than $1 million by paying an inflated
price for his home in Del Mar Heights, Calif., and allowing him to
live rent-free on a yacht in the Potomac River, among other items.
</P>
<P>
No charges have been brought against any other unnamed
co-conspirators but the investigation continues, prosecutors said.

Bribery a la Carte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
``The bribes Cunningham demanded and received ran the gamut from
the routine (expensive means, hotels and travel) to the peculiar (buck
knives, lasershot simulator system), the audacious (demands that a
defense contractor pay defendant's cross-country moving expenses and
additional cash bribes so the defendant could comfortably pay capital
gains tax on a prior bribe conveyed through a housing transaction),
the self-indulgent (luxury vehicles, yachts, homes, an antique Louise
Philippe commode, Persian rugs) and the truly astonishing ($500,000,
divided into two checks from one defense contractor, and a $525,000
wire transfer from a second defense contractor). Cunningham has
admitted the receipt of at least $2.4 million in bribes since 2000
...''
</P>
<P>
-- Justice Department memo on Randall ``Duke'' Cunningham
</P>
<P>
``The Routine'': Expensive Meals, Hotels and Travel
</P>
<P>
Defense contractors ``routinely and lavishly'' entertained
Cunningham at his favorite restaurants.
</P>
<P>
The memo: ``Cunningham grew to expect luxury. His co-conspirators
eagerly plied him with it. ...
</P>
<P>
``Cunningham would also be flown on private jets by these
co-conspirators to various locales around the country. These private
jets would cost thousands of dollars to charter. Meals on such private
jets would be catered, and would include expensive bottles of wine,
lobster and other extravagances. Accommodations were invariably
exclusive, top-of-the-line hotels or resorts ...''
</P>
<P>
``The Peculiar'': Buck Knives and Laser Hot Shooting Simulators
</P>
<P>
The memo illustrates that Cunningham grasped bribery payments in
amounts both large and small. While he asked for and received payments
from contractors in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, he also
accepted ``gifts'' of much lesser value, such as the ``Laser Shot
Shooting Simulator.''
</P>
<P>
The memo: ``This device is used primarily by federal and state
agencies to train officers on marksmanship, shot placements and
critical decision making skills. Among other things, the device comes
with recorded video scenarios that assists (sic) the shooter in
evaluating the situation and making appropriate shooting decisions.''
... One of the devices ``was installed in his Cunningham's (sic)
Congressional Office on Capital (sic) Hill.''
</P>
<P>
``The Audacious'': Capital Gains Tax Payments
</P>
<P>
The memo details how Cunningham sold a home in Del Mar, Calif., at
a greatly inflated price to defense contractor Mitchell Wade, who
pleaded guilty Friday in the case, and then asked the contractor for
more money to help pay the capital gains tax on the transaction. In
another instance, Cunningham demanded that Wade pay to ship a
collection of expensive antiques, rugs and other furnishings from
Virginia to California -- items that he had bought for Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
The memo: ``Cunningham instructed Coconspirator No. 2 to write him
a check for $115,100 and send it to his San Diego congressional
office. To conceal the transaction, Cunningham asked that the check
(no. 4704) be made payable to Cunningham's military memorabilia
business, Top Gun Enterprises Inc.''
</P>
<P>
``The Self-Indulgent'': Cars, Yachts, Homes and Antiques
</P>
<P>
The memo describes the complex deals through which Cunningham
acquired a $350,000 Virginia condo and a $2.55 million California
mansion with the bribe money from defense contractors. Equally
convoluted agreements provided the congressman with two yachts, one a
47-foot boat he named the ``Duke-Stir,'' the collection of antiques
and rugs, and a Rolls-Royce, as outlined here.
</P>
<P>
The memo: ``In approximately April 2002, Cunningham demanded
$10,000 from Coconspirator No. 2 to purchase a used Rolls Royce.
Coconspirator No. 2 gave Cunningham the money. When the car arrived at
the Port of Baltimore, the contractor dropped off Cunningham to pick
up the vehicle. Cunningham then demanded, and the contractor paid,
thousands of dollars to restore the car.''
</P>
<P>
``The Truly Astonishing'': Mortgage ``Financing''
</P>
<P>
The memo outlines how Cunningham inveigled contractors to provide
him with funds to pay off more than a million dollars in two mortgages
on the $2.55 million mansion that they had essentially bought for him.
One contractor paid him $525,000 on condition that he receive an
additional $6 million in government funds; the other paid him $500,000
in return for Cunningham's promise to support a specific defense
appropriations request.
</P>
<P>
The memo: ``But Cunningham was still not done. In August 2004,
Cunningham demanded that Coconspirator No. 2 pay him $500,000 to
eliminate the remaining mortgage burdens for his Rancho Santa Fe
mansion. In return, Cunningham promised to support a specific defense
appropriations request. Coconspirator No. 2 agreed. To disguise this
bribe, Coconspirator No. 2 divided the $500,000 into two unequal
checks ... both made out to Top Gun Enterprises. ...''
</P>
<P>
``The Bribe Menu''
</P>
<P>
For nearly 10 years, Cunningham in effect ``erected a 'for sale'
sign upon our nation's capital,'' the memo says, showing as evidence
what it called a ``bribe menu,'' a handwritten list on Cunningham's
stationery.
</P>
<P>
The memo: ``In this 'bribe menu,' the left column represented the
millions in government contracts that could be 'ordered' from
Cunningham. The right column was the amount of the bribes that the
Congressman was demanding in exchange for the contracts.''
</P>
<P>
The memo also urges the maximum sentence because Cunningham
``tampered with witnesses to interfere with the administration of
justice.'' Once Cunningham's schemes began to be made public in
newspaper reports in 2005, the memo says, he fabricated and tampered
with evidence to try to make his actions see plausible. The memo
outlines how, among other actions, he pressured a real estate agent to
justify the inflated sales price of one of his homes and trued to
persuade a rug dealer to vouch for a false cover story for him.

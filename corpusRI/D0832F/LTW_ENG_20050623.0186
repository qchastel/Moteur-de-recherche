Cunningham Breaks Silence Over Real Estate Deal

<P>
Rep. Randall ``Duke'' Cunningham, R-Calif.,after a
weeklong silence about his controversial home sale to a defense
contractor, issued a statement Thursday saying that he showed poor
judgment in selling the house to ``a friend who does business with the
government.''
</P>
<P>
Vowing to fight to defend his reputation, Cunningham said he did
nothing wrong and that he never gave preferential treatment to the
contractor's firm.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, who has also been criticized for living on the
contractor's 42-foot yacht, the Duke Stir, said he paid $13,000 in the
past year in berthing fees and maintenance costs. Living aboard the
yacht for free would violate ethics laws.
</P>
<P>
After releasing the statement, the 63-year-old, eight-term
congressman declined, through a spokesman, to answer questions and
said all further inquiries should be directed to his Washington, D.C.,
attorney. The house sale is being investigated by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
``I would never put the interests of a friend or a contractor above
the interests of my country,'' said Cunningham's statement. ``I trust
that the facts will bear out this truth over time.''
</P>
<P>
Cunningham sold his home in the Del Mar Heights neighborhood of San
Diego to Wade Mitchell, president and chief executive of
Washington-based MZM Inc., for $1,675,000 in November 2003.
</P>
<P>
Wade sold the home seven months later for $975,000, a $700,000
loss. Critics contend that Wade paid an inflated price as a way to
reward Cunningham for backing MZM's bid for lucrative defense
contracts.
</P>
<P>
The company has more than $66 million in federal contracts, most to
provide sophisticated intelligence gathering and analysis. MZM's
political action committee contributed $7,000 to Cunningham's 2004
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Cunningham repeated previous assertions that the
sale was based on comparative sales figures developed by a real estate
agent with a reputable firm. He said Wade wanted to buy a home in San
Diego because MZM was beginning work on a classified project at the
Miramar Marine Corps Air Station.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said he and his wife, Nancy, an official with the U.S.
Department of Education, had become friends with Wade and his wife,
Christiane. Their friendship led the Cunninghams to help with a
foundation that the Wades founded to help refugee children, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said any suggestion that he secured contracts for
Wade's company or improperly influenced the awarding of contracts was
``simply false.''
</P>
<P>
A watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in
Washington, has filed a Freedom of Information Act request for records
of contacts Cunningham has had with Pentagon and Department of
Homeland Security officials about MZM.
</P>
<P>
Francine Busby, Cunningham's Democratic opponent in last November's
election, said that Cunningham's response did little to clear up
ethical questions raised by Cunningham and his connection to Wade and
MZM.
</P>
<P>
``Coming clean is more than just admitting what everyone already
knows,'' she said. ``It's about showing that your actions meet the
high standards of honesty and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
Republicans defended Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
``When this is all over, I think the final story will be exactly
what Duke says: he made an error in judgment and showed naivete in
real estate but he's done nothing wrong and has always put America
first in everything he's done,'' said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
Issa backed Cunningham's statement that no member of Congress is
powerful enough to guarantee that a defense firm will receive a
contract.
</P>
<P>
``We all champion particular technologies or companies whose
products we have confidence in,'' Issa said in a telephone interview,
``but not even a full committee chairman can put a company into
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
Cunningham serves on the Select Committee on Intelligence, the
Military Appropriations Subcommittee and as chairman of the
Subcommittee on Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said he knew that Wade wanted a home near the Miramar
base and had a real estate agent send him a list of prices for
comparable homes.
</P>
<P>
``At the time of the sale, I failed to adequately consider how this
transaction might be perceived by others who don't know me,''
Cunningham's statement said. `` ... Again, I recognize that I showed
poor judgment in not listing the house publicly for sale.''
</P>
<P>
Wade and Elizabeth Todd, the agent who provided the comparable
prices, have not responded to repeated requests for interviews.

The Duke of D.C., Unhorsed
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not that it will matter all that much to him, but I
accept the sincerity of Randall Harold Cunningham, aka Randy ``Duke''
Cunningham, R-Calif., late of the U.S. House of Representatives, as he
stood outside the federal courthouse in San Diego this week and
tearfully acknowledged that he had done some pretty slimy deeds,
which, if the wheels of justice grind exceedingly fine as expected,
will have him adorned in a prison jumpsuit breaking big rocks into
little rocks for a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
But what I am still unable to fully comprehend is the sheer
magnitude of the man's audacity when he was riding high in the House.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the District of Columbia -- and even those in environs
beyond -- may appreciate that of which I speak after learning about the
event that transpired on Sept. 25, 2001. On that date Cunningham took
chutzpah to heights unknown to humankind.
</P>
<P>
Scene: The floor of the House. Matter under consideration: The
fiscal 2002 D.C. appropriations act. Speaker: Randy ``Duke''
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
The California Republican was explaining to the assembled
legislators why, after eight years on the D.C. appropriations
subcommittee, he had volunteered to stay there. He said he had joined
the subcommittee at the time of D.C. Mayor Marion Barry ( ``Berry,''
according to the Congressional Record.) Said Cunningham: ``I thought
what better place can we make some changes.''
</P>
<P>
Don't you dare laugh.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham then proceeded to touch on an area of city life that
caused him much unhappiness when he first joined the subcommittee.
Leasing arrangements for boat slips on the city's Southwest waterfront
were, he said, his chief concern. Then he laid this whopper on the
House: ``The City Council at that time was taking money under the
table to support leases.''
</P>
<P>
Now, let us pause.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post, the record will show, has chronicled over the
years an agglomeration of scandals involving officials of high and low
estate in the city government. But city council members taking money
under the table to support leases on the Southwest wharf was, I
thought at the time, a new one. It was also news to our research
department, which, at my request, conducted a search for such stories.
I also discussed Cunningham's revelation with council Chairman Linda
Cropp and the city's first elected council chairman, Sterling Tucker.
They were also stumped by his charge.
</P>
<P>
I turned to Cunningham's office for evidence at the time, too. His
staff was no help. I asked to speak with Cunningham, but he was
unavailable. I left a message explaining my request. Cunningham never
called back.
</P>
<P>
His non-response is not, however, the reason that his charge
against the council is in retrospect an unrivaled example of gall.
</P>
<P>
Consider this: When Duke Cunningham took to the House floor to
denounce a past city council as crooked, he was at that very moment
well into corruptly seeking and receiving bribes from two
co-conspirators in return for being influenced in the performance of
his official duties. His criminal acts are spelled out in the plea
agreement Cunningham signed with federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Cunningham the Corrupt, according to his plea agreement,
had embarked upon his life of crime at least a year before he took to
the House floor to malign Washington D.C.'s legislators.
</P>
<P>
In truth, congressional characters such as Cunningham have their
way with the city. They can get away with saying or doing anything.
Listen, for example, to Cunningham's reference to former D.C. mayor
Barry during a D.C. appropriations subcommittee hearing two years ago:
</P>
<P>
Cunningham: ``The other area that I worked on was the education
facility, all the way back from Marion Berry (sic) where most of the
money went up his nose instead of toward the education system.'' Yuck,
yuck.
</P>
<P>
Listen also to Cunningham, in the same public hearing, shamelessly
put the arm on a local economic development witness:
</P>
<P>
Cunningham: ``My brother was the President of the Chamber of
Commerce in St. Peters, Missouri, right outside of St. Louis. He's
looking for a job here in D.C., so if you've got an opening in the
Chamber, I'll give you his resume.''
</P>
<P>
D.C. Witness: ``It would be great, Mr. Chairman (sic). We'd be glad
to advance that.''
</P>
<P>
Cunningham: ``He also ran the seeder program in Texas, so he's got
a lot of experience.''
</P>
<P>
Cunningham used his perch on the D.C. appropriations subcommittee
to habitually badger the mayor and city officials to improve the
Southwest waterfront and the area of the Washington Marina where he
lived rent-free on a 42-foot yacht named ``Duke-Stir'' that a
co-conspirator bought in 2002 and reportedly moved to Cunningham's
slip for his personal use. And city officials responded to him as if
he were lord and master.
</P>
<P>
Defy Cunningham? As a member of the Appropriations Committee, he
had a hand on the city's purse strings. He had more say over how
D.C.-raised taxes were spent than did D.C. taxpayers themselves.
</P>
<P>
Despite pocketing bribes under the table, Cunningham could still
maliciously and falsely slam D.C. lawmakers from the vantage point of
his congressional glass house, secure in the knowledge that no city
official would dare toss a stone.
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Union-Tribune started the chain of reports that
brought him down. Were it not for that, the Duke might still be here
in Washington, lording it over D.C. leaders, accusing them of greed
and a piggishness that he practiced with unfettered abandon himself.

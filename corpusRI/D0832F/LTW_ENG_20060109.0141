Cunningham Attorney Denies Duke Recorded Officials

<P>
The attorney for Randall ``Duke'' Cunningham issued a
statement Monday denying that the disgraced former congressman had
worn a concealed microphone to gather evidence against other public
officials but declined to specify if he wore one in conversations with
private individuals.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by K. Lee Blalack, attorney for the former
eight-term Republican member of Congress, said that:
</P>
<P>
``The press, citing unnamed sources, continues to report that Duke
Cunningham wore a tape recording device, or wire, to surreptitiously
gather evidence on behalf of the government. This story is false.
</P>
<P>
''Duke has never worn a body wire during any conversations with his
former congressional colleagues or any other public official, and he
has not surreptitiously gathered evidence against any public
officials.``
</P>
<P>
Blalack, contacted at his Washington office, declined to clarify
whether Cunningham may have gathered evidence against those who do not
fit the definition of public officials, such as lobbyists or military
contractors. Cunningham resigned from Congress after pleading guilty
to bribery and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Time magazine last week reported that Cunningham had worn a
''wire`` at the behest of the government. The magazine did not specify
with whom Cunningham was meeting while wearing the device, but some
media outlets have suggested, without providing evidence, that
Cunningham may have been talking to members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Carol Lam declined comment on the Cunningham
statement and media reports about him wearing a hidden microphone.
</P>
<P>
Jan K. Caldwell, a spokeswoman for the FBI office in San Diego,
would not confirm nor deny the Time magazine report.
</P>
<P>
But a source close to the investigation, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, confirmed that Cunningham did wear a recording device
but would provide no further details.
</P>
<P>
In his Nov. 28 plea agreement with federal prosecutors, the
63-year-old Cunningham promised to help with the ongoing
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement gives no indication of what kind of help Cunningham
would provide, or whether he had already helped prosecutors. He faces
sentencing Feb. 27 on his guilty plea to taking $2.4 million in bribes
and avoiding more than $1 million in federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
The agreement lists four unnamed co-conspirators. None has yet been
charged. Through subpoenas issued in the case, the four are known to
be two defense contractors and two persons linked to them.
</P>
<P>
Although it is known that the contractors -- Mitchell Wade and
Brent Wilkes -- gave contributions to other elected officials, nothing
in Cunningham's plea agreement indicates the case involves such
officials.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the House of Representative, any member who is
subpoenaed must announce that fact on the House floor. Cunningham made
such an announcement when the investigation in San Diego and
Washington got under way, but there have been no other announcements.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for bribes, Cunningham admitted, he helped the
contractors through his position on powerful House committees. The
committees can influence the awarding of lucrative defense contracts,
particularly since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks which has prompted
the Pentagon to increase spending for intelligence projects.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham resigned from Congress within days of his guilty plea in
federal court. An April 11 special election is set to fill the
remaining months of his eighth term.

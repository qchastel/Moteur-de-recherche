Rep. Cunningham's Deals With Contractor Questioned

<P>
Rep. Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, a Vietnam War hero and
``top gun'' fighter pilot, serves on the House subcommittee that
appropriates money for the nation's defense. The California Republican
also lives on a yacht berthed on the Potomac that is owned by the
president of a local defense firm whose contracts Cunningham has
supported.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Cunningham and the defense executive,
Mitchell J. Wade, doesn't stop there. Two years ago, Wade bought
Cunningham's house in California at a price that turned out to be much
higher than it fetched at resale. Wade, who put the property up for
sale soon after he bought it, had to swallow a $700,000 loss.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said that he supported government contracts for Wade's
firm, Washington-based MZM Inc., according to the San Diego
Union-Tribune, which first reported the real estate transaction
Sunday. But the congressman said in written statements that he has
done nothing wrong, did not sell his house at an inflated price and
would disclose additional details about paying for his stay on the
yacht as soon as he compiled them.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham declined to be interviewed Thursday. Officials at MZM
did not return phone calls or respond to a visit.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's relationship with Wade has created a furor among
Democrats and interest groups, which demanded an investigation. Naomi
Seligman, deputy director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in
Washington, said Cunningham's ``sweetheart'' deals should be
investigated because they might violate House rules. Asked about the
Cunningham disclosures, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,
said: ``I think the ethics committee has to do its job.''
</P>
<P>
Wade is also involved in Cunningham's housing situation in
Washington. The North County Times of Escondido, Calif., reported
Thursday that Cunningham is living at least temporarily on a 42-foot
yacht owned by Wade and kept at the Capital Yacht Club. The boat's
name: Duke Stir. It could not be determined Thursday whether the name
is a reference to the congressman's nickname.
</P>
<P>
MZM and Wade also donated money to Cunningham's re-election effort.
The company and its affiliates, for instance, contributed $20,000 in
``soft money'' to Cunningham's American Prosperity PAC State Fund
between 2000 and 2002, according to PoliticalMoneyLine.com.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's ties with MZM go further. The congressman was the
keynote speaker at MZM's Christmas party for 385 people at the Four
Seasons Hotel in Washington last Dec. 8, where he helped dispense
silver dollars to recovering Iraq war veterans whom the company
invited to the festivities, according to an attendee who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham also is listed on the Web site of the Sure Foundation, a
charitable group with ties to MZM and Wade, as a member of an
``honorary committee'' for the Foxfield Races. The twice-yearly
Charlottesville, Va., horse race raises money for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
Nancy and April Cunningham are among four people listed on the
foundation's Web site as members of the ``advisory council.'' Nancy is
the name of the lawmaker's wife, and he has a daughter named April.
</P>
<P>
The foundation, which tax forms said was created with a loan from
Wade, lists its address as MZM's headquarters in the District. Wade is
listed on the foundation's Web site as the foundation's treasurer and
his wife, Christiane, is named as its ``president emeritus.''
</P>
<P>
MZM also has ties to Rep. Virgil Goode, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
In the 2004 election cycle, Goode's largest contributor was MZM;
its political action committee and its employees, including Wade, gave
a total of $48,551, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
Goode was the principal sponsor of a provision in 2003 defense
legislation that called for the creation of a military center in his
district, known as the Foreign Supplier Assessment Center, which MZM
was hired to run, said a senior defense official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the center, which is meant to check on the
ownership of foreign companies that contract with the Defense
Department, will do useful work, but was not a Pentagon priority and
was not requested by the Defense Department. It was mandated by Goode
on MZM's behalf, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A November 2003 press release by Virginia Gov. Mark Warner, D, said
Goode was ``instrumental in securing this project for Virginia.''
Goode himself, in the release, said, ``I believe that MZM will add a
new dimension to the economy of Martinsville,'' where the center is
located.
</P>
<P>
In March, April and May of 2003 -- the year that Goode sponsored the
legislation, Wade, his wife, MZM officer James C. King, and King's
wife gave Goode's election campaign a total of $12,000, according to
PoliticalMoneyLine.com. MZM's political action committee also donated
$10,000 to Goode's campaign in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Goode's office did not respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
Wade founded MZM 1993. Last fiscal year, the firm had about $65
million in Pentagon contracts, ranking it among the 100 largest
federal information technology contractors, according to Washington
Technology magazine.

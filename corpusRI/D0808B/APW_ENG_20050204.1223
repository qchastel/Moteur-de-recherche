About a third of expatriate Iraqis who voted by absentee ballot last week in the
United States chose the Shiite party backed by Iraq's leading clerics, followed
closely by a party made up of Iraqi Christians, according to provisional results
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The United Iraqi Alliance, which was endorsed by the influential Shiite cleric
Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani, won nearly 32 percent of the 24,278 valid votes
cast at five polling sites in the United States. The ticket led expatriate
voting around the world and in Iraq in early results from Sunday's
vote.
</P>
<P>
A slate of Chaldean and Assyrian Christians called the National Rafidain List
polled about 29 percent in the United States, where it found its largest bloc of
votes among the 14 nations where elections were held for Iraqis living
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish ticket Kurdish Alliance List received nearly 17 percent of the U.S.
vote, while the list led by current Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, which had been
expected to do well among expatriates, only won about 4 percent of votes in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The votes will help determine the makeup of a new National Assembly, which will
draft Iraq's new constitution. Each faction is given seats based on its overall
share of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Results were released by the International Organization for Migration, which ran
the overseas voting. The American sites included Washington, Chicago, Detroit,
Los Angeles and Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
Some Iraqi groups criticized the U.S. vote because it was held at only five
sites and organized in just a few weeks. Some voters had to drive hundreds of
miles twice, once to register and a second time to vote.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Kassab, president of the Chaldean National Congress, based in the Detroit
area, said more Christians compose a large portion of the Iraqis living in the
United States, which likely accounted for the strong showing by the National
Rafidain List. The party also polled well in Australia, where 36 percent voted
for it.
</P>
<P>
Kassab said he feared the expected Shiite majority will not be attentive to
minority parties and groups in Iraq, such as Christians.
</P>
<P>
"We need to make sure we have a good secular government so the constitution of
Iraq recognizes the rights of minorities and other ethnic groups," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Raaed Al-Haddad, 30, of Raleigh, North Carolina, said he voted for the United
Iraqi Alliance because he felt it was an inclusive ticket, with Sunni Muslims
and Kurds included among its leaders. Al-Haddad, a Shiite Muslim, was also
pleased that some of the minority groups had a strong showing in the U.S.
voting.
</P>
<P>
"We need this in the government," he said. "We need the Sunnis, the Christians
and the Kurds."

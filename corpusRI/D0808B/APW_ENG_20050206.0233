<P>
Hundreds of Iraqis shouted slogans and waived Iraqi flags Sunday outside
Baghdad's heavily guarded Green Zone to protest alleged voting irregularities in
Mosul that they say prevented tens of thousands from voting in last weekend's
landmark elections.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were mainly Iraqi Christians, Turkomen and Yazidis _ members
of a small religion in the north _ who say polling centers never opened in their
neighborhoods in the turbulent northern city and in the surrounding Ninevah
province.
</P>
<P>
Electoral commission officials in Baghdad have acknowledged that many polling
sites never opened or opened late on Jan. 30 and said that was because of
security concerns. Some of those that did open could not be supplied with
ballots and other election materials, officials have said.
</P>
<P>
A team of independent lawyers is investigating those and other complaints in the
city and is to report back to the electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
"We are protesting because we have been deprived of our right to participate in
the elections," said Shameil Benjamin from a Christian party called the
Democratic Assyrian Movement.
</P>
<P>
"There were irregularities and we felt that the injustice was inflicted on us,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Chaldean and Assyrian parties, William Warda, said the
irregularities prevented 200,000 people from voting.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators gathered outside the Green Zone, which houses the offices of
the interim Iraqi government as well as the U.S. and British embassies. The
Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq is also based inside the
compound.
</P>
<P>
Banners held aloft read, "Assyrians, Turkomens, Yazidis have the right to enjoy
the essence of freedom" and "We demand our democratic rights and we reject
marginalization."
</P>
<P>
Mosul has become a flashpoint for insurgents battling U.S. and Iraqi security
forces in recent weeks. In November, rebels launched an uprising there that
forced nearly the entire police force to desert their posts.

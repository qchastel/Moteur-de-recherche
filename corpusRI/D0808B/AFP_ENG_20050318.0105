The Al-Qaeda linked Army of Ansar 
al-Sunna claimed it had killed a Christian general in the Iraqi 
police force earlier this week in northern Iraq, in a statement 
posted on an Islamist website on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"On the main Baghdad road in the northern city of Kirkuk, a 
group of fighters ... attacked the head of the police, a Christian 
general, with assault rifles," said the group in an overnight 
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The general was killed and the knights returned safely to 
base," it said.
</P>
<P>
The authenticity of the statement could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Police had said earlier that General Waed Yussuf Yacoub was shot 
dead late on Wednesday as he drove home in the northern oil city of 
Kirkuk.
</P>
<P>
The general, who worked at the interior ministry and was a 
pillar of the Christian community in Kirkuk, was gunned down when a 
car pulled up alongside his vehicle, they said.
</P>
<P>
Yacoub, a member of the Chaldean-Assyrian Church, helped recruit 
Christians to Kirkuk's police force.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's 700,000 Christian community has been targeted by rebels 
since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in April 2003 and many 
members of the dwindling minority have fled the country.
</P>
<P>
The Army of Ansar al-Sunna has claimed a string of attacks in 
Iraq, including murders of foreign hostages and Iraqis accused of 
"collaborating" with US-led forces. It has released video footage 
showing some of the killings.
</P>
<P>
The group also claimed a December 21, 2004 attack on a US base 
in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul that killed 22 people, including 
14 US soldiers.

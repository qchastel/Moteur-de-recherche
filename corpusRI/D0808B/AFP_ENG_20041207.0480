<P>
Two churches in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul came under
simultaneous attack on Tuesday, witnesses and clerics said, but there
were no immediate reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen stormed into the city's Chaldean and Armenian churches in the
latest attacks on Iraq's minority Christian community, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Gunmen entered the church at about 4:30 pm (1330 GMT). They gathered
those present in one room and planted explosive charges in different
parts of the building," said Father Raghid Aziz Kara at the Chaldean
church.
</P>
<P>
"We were then taken outside and the armed men set off the devices. We
heard three blasts," he told AFP outside the church which was set
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
At the same moment, gunmen attacked an Armenian church, forcing out a
security guard and two other people inside the building, the guard
said, adding: "I heard two explosions."
</P>
<P>
The Chaldean church, one of the largest in Mosul, was built in the
1950s and enlarged four decades later.
</P>
<P>
The Chaldeans, whose 600,000 people represent the majority of
Christians in Iraq, are an oriental rite Catholic community.
</P>
<P>
Armenian Christians in Iraq number only a few thousand.
</P>
<P>
On November 8, at least three people were killed and 45 wounded when
two suspected car bombs exploded within minutes of each other outside
two churches in southern Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In a coordinated assault on August 1, six car bombs killed 10 people
and injured 50 others outside churches in Baghdad and Mosul.

IRAQI CHRISTIANS FLOURISHED LONG BEFORE MUSLIMS

<P>
The kidnapping of a Catholic bishop
in Mosul last week is a sad reminder of the
once robust but rapidly diminishing Christian community in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Insurgents abducted Syrian Catholic Archbishop Basile Casmoussa apparently to frighten Iraqi
Christians. They wanted to discourage Christians from voting on Sunday,
according to Iraqi bishop, Louis Sako of Kirkuk.
</P>
<P>
Both bishops are members of a branch of the Roman Catholic
Church and one of several small, eclectic church groups in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Christians flourished in Iraq long before anyone, anywhere was Muslim. The
advent of Islam in the seventh century began the decline
of Christianity in the Middle East. Many are now migrating
from the war-torn country. Numbers are hard to verify, but
there are significantly fewer than two million Christians among the
24 million Iraqis today.
</P>
<P>
The story of Christianity in and around Iraq is a mixture
of history and myth but certainly began in the very
early days of the faith.
</P>
<P>
St. Thaddaeus generally gets credit for bringing the new faith to
Assyrians living throughout Mesopotamia, the vast area that is now
part of Iraq, Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Thaddaeus, however, has a murky history. He is also known as
the Apostle Jude, the brother of James and author of
the New Testament letter of Jude. Thaddaeus is at times
linked to a St. Addai who was a missionary to
Mesopotamia in the second century. St. Thomas the apostle, Sts.
Mari and Aggai are also honored as founders of the
faith among the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
In any event, Christianity in Iraq, through what is known as
the Assyrian Church of the East, took root very shortly
after the faith was born. The language of liturgy there
was and, in some cases, remains Aramaic, the tongue Jesus
spoke.
</P>
<P>
By the 16th century, the Assyrian Church, long splintering, began to
take its present shape. Some groups remained loyal to the
Orthodox tradition, while others, such as the Chaldean Catholic Church,
professed loyalty to the Catholic church in the West. Protestants
also began to gain a foothold .
</P>
<P>
The Syrian Catholic Church of which the kidnapped bishop is a
member has a significant presence in Iraq. That community traces
its roots to the church in Antioch, Syria, where, the
Bible says, followers of Christ were first called Christian. It
was united with the Roman Catholic Church in 1871.
</P>
<P>
Christians in Iraq have a rich, ancient and complex history. Sadly,
they may not have a future.

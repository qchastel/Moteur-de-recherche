Armed men kidnapped a Catholic 
archbishop in Iraq's main northern city of Mosul Monday, a local 
priest said, prompting denunciations from the Vatican of what it 
called a "terrorist act".
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Basil George Casmusa, 66, leader of the city's Syrian 
Catholic community, was seized by gunmen at around 5 pm (1400 GMT) 
as he was about to enter his car, Father Faraj told AFP.

<P>
The kidnappers then tossed him into the trunk of their vehicle 
before speeding away, said the priest, who follows the rival 
Chaldean rite.
</P>
<P>
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls said the Holy See 
"condemns in the firmest manner this terrorist act and demands that 
Monsignor Casmusa be rapidly returned safe and well to his 
ministry".
</P>
<P>
The prelate heads the 35,000-strong Syrian Catholic church in 
Mosul. All of Iraq's Christian denominations -- Assyrian, Syrian, 
Armenian and Greek -- have wings which recognize the supremacy of 
the Holy See.
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II, who named Casmusa archbishop in 1999, late 
last year condemned attacks on Catholic churches in Mosul, including 
an attack on the home of the leader of the Chaldean community -- the 
Catholic breakaway from the Assyrian Church.

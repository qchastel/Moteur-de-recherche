ASSYRIANS FEAR IRAQ CONSTITUTION (From McClatchy News Service, for use by
New York Times News Service clients.) For Release Sunday, July
10 WASHINGTON The new Iraqi constitution is already shaking the
San Joaquin Valley, and it's not even written yet.
</P>
<P>
Local Assyrians worry the new constitution will favor Islam over Christianity.
Their worries mobilize local lawmakers, who are now starting to
lean on the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
"(They are) incredibly concerned about the current drafting of the constitution,"
Merced Democrat Dennis Cardoza said. "The reports they are hearing
is that (Iraq is) drafting a fundamentalist Islamic document."
</P>
<P>
The local worries and the political response they generate illustrate how
ethnic constituencies shape congressional action. Beyond that, the long-distance lobbying
over Iraq's constitution highlights the controversial power the United States
retains over a sovereign nation.
</P>
<P>
Much closer to home, it could shape at least one local
congressional race.
</P>
<P>
With between 30,000 and 45,000 Assyrians thought to be living in
Merced, Stanislaus and San Joaquin counties, the region claims one
of the largest such populations in the United States. Assyrian
media serves the region, as do Assyrian churches, and politicians
know to be attentive.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Cardoza met with His Beatitude Mar Emmanuel III Delly, the
patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church. The Assyrian religious leader
advised Cardoza about developments in Iraq, prompting the congressman to
echo the concerns in a July 6 letter to President
Bush.
</P>
<P>
"The Assyrian people suffered greatly in their attempts to obtain greater
freedom and recognition," wrote Cardoza, a member of the House
International Relations Committee. "It would be outrageous for minorities who
have suffered and sacrificed so much to not be afforded
protection under the new constitution."
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans, though, view Cardoza's solicitude skeptically.
</P>
<P>
"The Assyrians, to be perfectly honest, until now haven't seen too
much of Congressman Cardoza," said John Kanno, an Assyrian who
has declared his candidacy against Cardoza. "All of a sudden,
he's pandering to the Assyrian community now that he's got
an Assyrian running against him."
</P>
<P>
Kanno's parents left their native Iraq in 1957-58; he was subsequently
born in England, and has lived in the United States
since 1981. An engineer now living in Modesto, Kanno did
agree with Cardoza that "we want freedom of religion" and
"some kind of safe haven" under the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
In June 2003, Cardoza introduced a House resolution expressing concern about
the status of Assyrians in post-war Iraq. The resolution gained
10 co-sponsors, including Mariposa Republican George Radanovich, but did not
reach the House floor.
</P>
<P>
The transitional law currently governing Iraq calls for a draft of
the new constitution to be completed by Aug. 15. It
is supposed to be submitted to the Iraqi public for
ratification by Oct. 15. One six-month extension is permitted, in
case Iraqi officials cannot meet the original deadlines.
</P>
<P>
This week, the Iraqi National Assembly committee drafting the constitution was
expanded to 71 members with the addition of 15 Sunnis.
Dominated by Shiites, the committee includes one Assyrian Christian, 15
Kurds and one communist, among others. Iraqi officials insist no
extension will be needed.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to stay on that timetable," Bush told reporters last
month, following a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari,
"and it's important for the Iraqi people to know we
are."
</P>
<P>
A current draft of the proposed constitution, translated by George Washington
University scholar Nathan Brown, includes a provision stating that "discrimination
on the basis of gender, nationality, religion, origin or social
standing is forbidden." The draft also states that "the Iraqi
citizen has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religious
creed and religious rites."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, with Muslims making up more than 90
percent of Iraq's population, Islam may well be declared the
nation's official religion. In an interview, Brown said Friday that
while the "principles" of religious tolerance will be articulated in
the constitution, "the devil will be in the details" as
the new Iraqi Parliament begins writing specific laws.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Brown added, will have "some influence" in this,
but won't be able to dictate the complete work. Still,
Cardoza said that "we have a certain amount of pressure
we can bring to bear" on the Iraqis who are
writing their nation's new governing documents.
</P>
<P>
"A number of our young men and women have died to
bring them their freedoms," Cardoza said.

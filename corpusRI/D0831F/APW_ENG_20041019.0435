Colombian rebel arrested in attack that targeted Americans in Bogota
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Police arrested a rebel commando who last year allegedly attacked a
Bogota pub, killing one woman and injuring dozens of other people,
authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Colombian National Police arrested Adolfo Toledo, who goes by the
alias "Dollar," after he produced a fake identification during a
traffic stop Monday in the southern Colombian village of Algeciras,
police said.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 15, 2003, rebels dressed in plain clothes tossed hand
grenades into two brewpubs _ the Bogota Beer Company and Palos de
Moguer _ both of which are frequented by American soldiers,
contractors and journalists.
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities have said the attack aimed at killing Americans. It
was the first time the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, launched an indiscriminate attack against U.S. citizens. Among
the wounded were U.S. contractors supporting Colombia's war against
the rebels and an American Airlines pilot.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Jorge Daniel Castro, chief of the Colombian National Police,
said Toledo threw one of the grenades into the patio of the Bogota
Beer Company, where most of the casualties occurred.
</P>
<P>
Toledo has been charged with terrorism, homicide and conspiracy in
Colombia, according to President Alvaro Uribe's office. But Castro
indicated he would just as soon see Toledo sent to the United States
to be tried and punished.
</P>
<P>
"How great it would be to see a terrorist like this going to the
jails of the United States," Castro said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Arturo Montano, 26, was sentenced to 26 years in
prison after pleading guilty to tossing hand grenades into the
brewpubs. He was caught by a security guard minutes after the attack
in Bogota's Zona Rosa nightclub district.
</P>
<P>
Toledo and Montano have been identified as members of the FARC's
Teofilo Forero Column, an elite unit of the rebel group which has
been waging guerrilla warfare in this Andean nation for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The arrest came as the FARC said it is prepared to enter into talks
with representatives of the Roman Catholic Church to facilitate an
exchange of hostages held by the rebels _ including three U.S.
military contractors _ for imprisoned guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to meet with representatives of the Catholic church
as many times as is necessary in any place that has (security)
guarantees for them as well as us," Raul Reyes, a FARC spokesman,
said in a statement broadcast by Noticias Uno television on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Luis Augusto Castro said the FARC statement is encouraging
news, noting that it is the first time the rebels have said they
would be willing to meet with church officials outside Colombia.
</P>
<P>
But Reyes insisted that any meetings with the government take place
in two counties in southern Colombia that would be declared
demilitarized zones. Uribe has ruled out creating safe havens for the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
While priests have been in contact with Reyes and other FARC leaders,
no formal role has been laid out for them.
</P>
<P>
The FARC kidnaps hundreds of people a year for ransom, and also holds
dozens of so-called "exchangeables," including Colombian politicians,
police officers, soldiers and the three U.S. contractors.
</P>
<P>
The FARC says the hostages would be released only when the government
releases jailed rebels.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are far from reaching an agreement and formal talks have
not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
The government insists the freed rebels be sent to another country,
or another method be found that would prevent them from rejoining the
FARC and kidnapping more people. The FARC says any freed rebels
should be returned to the rebel group.

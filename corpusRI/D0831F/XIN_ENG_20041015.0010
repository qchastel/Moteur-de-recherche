The office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Thursday
condemned the killing of five members of the same family in north
Colombia last Friday, local press said.
</P>
<P>
The UN office demanded the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) clarify whether it was responsible for the crime. It
also asked the group to ensure strict compliance of its members with
international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
Five members of the same family, four of them women, were murdered
last Friday by armed individuals who broke into their house in Coloso
in the northern Sucre province.
</P>
<P>
One of the victims was pregnant for four months. Two others were girl
friends of a soldier and a police agent of the area.
</P>
<P>
The Sucre authorities blamed FARC guerrillas for the killing, who has
not yet claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The UN office believed the women were murdered because of their
relationship with law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian authorities on Wednesday captured a FARC member who was
suspected of being involved in the Coloso killing.
</P>
<P>
The FARC, with 17,000 members, is the country's largest and oldest
rebel organization.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been plagued by a four-decade civil war, in which
leftist rebels, far-right paramilitaries and government troops fight
each other, killing about 3,500 people every year.

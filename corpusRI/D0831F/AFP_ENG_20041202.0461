The Colombian government plans to pardon more than 30 members of the
left wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as the two
sides negotiate a prisoners swap, a senior official told AFP
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Through this unilateral gesture, which will be announced once legal
questions are settled, President Alvaro Ulribe is showing the FARC
his desire to reach a humanitarian accord," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The official, who requested anonymity, said the government had an
initial plan to free 37 rebel prisoners but the number could change
as lawyers were still studying individual cases.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been arguing over details of a swap.
</P>
<P>
Uribe announced in October that he was read to negotiate a prisoner
exchange with the largest of the country's rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
In November, the FARC leadership rejected a proposition by Uribe to
exchange 50 guerrillas against 59 hostages in FARC hands: three
Americans, 22 politicians, including a Franco-Colombian Ingrid
Betancourt, and 34 military and police.
</P>
<P>
The Marxist FARC has about 17,000 fighters and is said to be holding
1,600 hostages.

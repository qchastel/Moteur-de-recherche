The United Nations expected the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) to consider in a constructive way Colombian President
Alvaro Uribe's proposal for the humanitarian exchange, UN special
envoy James Lemoyne said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The UN said in a statement that it values the new proposal on
humanitarian exchange between the FARC and the government, which is
supported by the Catholic Church and the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Uribe proposed to the FARC that the two sides to
negotiate in the Apostolic nuncio's premises, or in an embassy in
Bogota, in five days.
</P>
<P>
However, the Colombian leader rejected a FARC proposal to
demilitarize an area to swap hostages for its jailed members.
</P>
<P>
An eventual humanitarian exchange deal would lead to the release of
22 politicians, 37 members of the military and three US citizens, in
exchange for 50 FARC guerrillas in Colombian prisons.
</P>
<P>
The FARC, the largest and oldest guerrilla organization in Colombia,
has at least 17,000 men operating in different regions of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been plagued by a four-decade civil war, in which
leftist rebels, far-right paramilitaries and government troops fight
each other, killing about 3,500 people every year.

<P>
A federal investigation into the alleged kidnapping of a Colombian rebel leader
who turned up in the custody of Colombian police last month is under way,
Venezuela's interior minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Jesse Chacon said authorities were investigating whether
Rodrigo Granda, a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
was kidnapped in Caracas _ Venezuela's capital _ and later moved to Cucuta, a
Colombian town along the border where he was picked up by Colombian
police.
</P>
<P>
Chacon's comments came three days after the FARC said in a statement that
Granda, a foreign relations official for the armed group, had been seized by
Colombian intelligence agents in Caracas on Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, which was posted Sunday on a Web site linked to the rebel
group, the FARC said Granda was collared in Caracas after taking part in two
days of meetings with other leftist organizations that support Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez.
</P>
<P>
The FARC called the arrest a "lamentable precedent" and asked Venezuela's
government to "define its position" regarding the ability for members of the
FARC and other left-leaning groups to enter Venezuela in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Chacon told a press conference that Venezuelan authorities were investigating
the kidnapping of an unidentified man in western Caracas on Dec. 13, but said it
remains unclear whether the victim of the abduction was Granda.
</P>
<P>
"The investigations still have not shown the identity of the person kidnapped,"
Chacon said.
</P>
<P>
Chacon said Venezuelan authorities have not determined whether Granda attended a
forum organized by left-leaning groups prior to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
"There was a large number of people who participated in this forum who were not
invited, both Venezuelans and those from other Latin American countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement on the Web site linked to the FARC, Granda was in
Venezuela "on the invitation of (socialist) organizations based in Venezuela,
with the approval of government authorities."
</P>
<P>
Venezuela "has no proof" that Colombian agents participated in the kidnapping,
said Chacon. He added that Venezuela would "take action" if investigations
showed that Colombian authorities were involved.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government denies it arrested Granda in Venezuela. Colombian
officials contend the guerrilla leader was arrested on Dec. 14, shortly after he
crossed the border and arrived in Cucuta.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders in Venezuela _ along with some Colombian politicians _ have
repeatedly accused Chavez, a self-proclaimed "revolutionary," of collaborating
with Colombia's leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Chavez has long denied aiding Colombia's two main rebel groups: the FARC, and
the smaller National Liberation Army, which is known as the ELN.
</P>
<P>
The FARC and ELN have been fighting to overthrow the Colombian government for 40
years. The conflict, in which right-wing paramilitary groups that support the
government are also involved, claims about 3,500 lives each year.

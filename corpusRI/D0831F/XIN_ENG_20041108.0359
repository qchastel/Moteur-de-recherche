The leftist rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) on
Monday rejected a government proposal to hold face-to-face talks at a
foreign embassy in Bogota aimed at exchanging jailed rebels for
hostages held by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, FARC asked President Alvaro Uribe to grant the rebel
group the two southern demilitarized zones, San Vicente del Caguan
and Cartagena del Chaira, before discussions on a prisoner exchange
take place, a demand that the government has already rejected.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 27, Uribe proposed to hold talks with FARC on the release of
15 jailed rebels at the Vatican's embassy or another diplomatic
mission in Bogota in return for hostages held by FARC.
</P>
<P>
FARC said in the statement that it would not negotiate unless the two
southern counties are demilitarized, allowing the rebels to transfer
their dozens of hostages from a region where the government has
launched a military attack.
</P>
<P>
The government on Monday reiterated that it would not demilitarize
any zones because it has to guarantee the safety of the people across
the country.
</P>
<P>
FARC also criticized the Uribe proposal and termed it as a political
maneuver of the president, seeking to benefit his re- election
attempt for the year 2006, when his presidential term expires.
</P>
<P>
FARC is the largest insurgent group in Colombia with up to 20, 000
combatants across the country.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been plagued by a four-decade civil war, in which
leftist rebels, far-right paramilitaries and government troops fight
each other, killing about 3,500 people every year.

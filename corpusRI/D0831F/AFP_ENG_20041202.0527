The Colombian government on Thursday announced that it was pardoning
23 members of the left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC), as the two sides negotiate a prisoner swap.
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner for peace, Luis Carlos Restrepo, said the move
was "a new attempt to convince the guerrillas to agree to a
humanitarian accord."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, a senior official told AFP the government plans to
pardon more than 30 members of the FARC.
</P>
<P>
"Through this unilateral gesture, ... President Alvaro Uribe is
showing the FARC his desire to reach a humanitarian accord," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The official, who requested anonymity, said the government had an
initial plan to free 37 rebel prisoners, but the number could change,
as lawyers were still studying individual cases.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been arguing over details of a swap.
</P>
<P>
Uribe announced in October that he was ready to negotiate a prisoner
exchange with the largest of the country's rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
In November, the FARC leadership rejected a proposition by Uribe to
exchange 50 guerrillas for 59 hostages held by the FARC: three
Americans, 22 politicians, including Franco-Colombian Ingrid
Betancourt, and 34 military and police officers.
</P>
<P>
The Marxist FARC has about 17,000 fighters and is said to be holding
1,600 hostages.

<P>
President Alvaro Uribe said late Thursday he was ready to negotiate a
prisoner swap with the country's largest rebel group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
The talks to exchange 59 hostages held by the rebels -- local
politicians, military, police -- for some 50 jailed FARC members
could last up to five days and be held at a foreign embassy or the
Vatican's embassy in Bogota, Uribe said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The president asked the Swiss government to deliver his proposal to
the FARC leadership and repeat to them his August 18 offer to
unilaterally release some jailed rebels as a goodwill gesture to be
followed by the release of a group of politicians being held hostage.
</P>
<P>
Uribe reiterated his demand that any rebel released from jail must
not have committed "a major crime and that they promise not to return
to the guerrilla group either by leaving the country or undergo a
program of reintegration (into civilian life in Colombia."
</P>
<P>
Once the the rebels are released from jail, Uribe added, "the
guerrilla must make a gesture to free some of the Colombians it is
holding.
</P>
<P>
"At that moment, we will take the third step, which is to negotiate
in an embassy or at the Vatican nunciature in Bogota, for five days,
to thrash out the agreement," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Uribe said he decided to negotiate with the FARC after speaking with
hostages' families around the country, who urged him to strike a deal
with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"I face here a serious dilemma: I feel the intense pain of the
victims' families, but also the great responsibility in leading the
government and avoiding any agreement that could undermine our
national security," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Government peace commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo later provided
more details of Uribe's offer to the FARC.
</P>
<P>
He said the president offered the initial release of 15 jailed
guerrillas in exchange for 15 FARC hostages and that FARC negotiators
would be brought to and from their mountain hideouts to Bogota for
the negotiations by the International Red Cross and the Roman
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
Restrepo also stressed that Uribe's offer did not mean the military's
anti-guerrilla operations around the country would be suspended.
</P>
<P>
Uribe's announcement follows the release of a videotape by the FARC
three days ago showing that 12 provincial lawmakers it captured in
April 2002 were alive. The hostages in the recordings urged the
government to enter in direct negotiations with the FARC.
</P>
<P>
The politicians are among 59 people held hostage by the FARC,
including 22 politicians, 34 military personnel and police officers
and three US nationals.
</P>
<P>
To Uribe's August 18 proposals, the FARC on September 14 responded by
demanding that the government demilitarize a vast southern region
comprising the townships of San Vicente del Caguan and Cartagena del
Chaira.
</P>
<P>
The government turned down the rebel demand.
</P>
<P>
Uribe's latest announcement has raised cautious hope among the
relatives of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Yolanda Pulecio, the mother of Ingrid Betancourt, a former
presidential candidate who has French nationality as well as
Colombian and who was kidnapped nearly three years ago, said she was
"surprised by the president's change in attitude."
</P>
<P>
"It gives me a lot of hope. Maybe it will unravel this tough
situation we're living through, this waiting for so long. We were all
so desperate because we could see no light, no way out. I hope God
will make it happen," Pulecio said.

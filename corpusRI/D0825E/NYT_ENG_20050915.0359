KRAFT INTRODUCES 2 SOMEWHAT HEALTHIER COOKIES MADE OF WHOLE GRAINS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the efforts of food companies to appease nutrition advocates and
serve an increasing number of health-conscious consumers, Kraft Foods has
crossed an improbable threshold -- a healthier cookie.
</P>
<P>
At a nutrition and obesity conference Thursday in Sacramento, Kraft's chief
executive, Roger Deromedi unveiled whole-grain versions of the popular Chips
Ahoy and Fig Newton cookies -- a first among major
food companies.
</P>
<P>
"They're baked with 100 percent whole grains, contain zero grams of
trans fat per serving, and most important, taste terrific," said
Deromedi, who participated with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and 800 schoolchildren
in a one-mile walk.
</P>
<P>
The cookies, which start appearing in stores this week, are the
latest in the food industry's infatuation with whole grains. As
large food companies wrestle with claims that they have contributed
to America's obesity problem, manufacturers have added whole grains to
cereal, breads, crackers and now cookies.
</P>
<P>
Whole grains are considered healthier because they are less processed and
retain more of their nutrients and vitamins. Instead of refined
and bleached white flour, Kraft's cookies are made with whole-wheat
flour, which contains naturally occurring B vitamins, vitamin E, iron
and folic acid. Whole wheat also contains fiber, which slows
digestion.
</P>
<P>
Kraft's announcement was timed to the California conference in an attempt
to show that the company is attentive to the health
concerns of parents, who are increasingly worried about not just
their own weight but that of their children. In the
last three decades, the overweight rate among teenagers has tripled;
in adults, obesity has doubled.
</P>
<P>
In the face of such statistics, many state and local governments
have moved to purge soda and unhealthy snacks from schools.
Thursday, Schwarzenegger also signed an ambitious school nutrition law. The
bill requires that by 2007, all California public schools will
sell only bottled water, low-fat milk, drinks with at least
50 percent fruit juice, sports drinks and snacks that meet
fat, sugar and calorie restrictions.
</P>
<P>
While the new cookies are not healthy enough to make it
into California schools under the guidelines, Kraft, a unit of
Altria, says that the products give consumers who are looking
to increase their whole-grain consumption a choice.
</P>
<P>
But nutrition specialists warn that consumers should not think they are
eating a health snack with either of the whole-grain cookies.
A three-cookie serving of the new Chips Ahoy has 8
grams of fat and 150 calories, 10 fewer than the
original. And there is one additional gram of fiber, two
per serving instead of one.
</P>
<P>
Each serving of whole-grain Chips Ahoy and Fig Newtons has 8
grams of whole grains, roughly 16 percent of the Federal
Drug Administration's recommended intake of whole grains. In addition to
whole wheat, other whole-grain foods are oatmeal, granola, brown and
wild rice, as well as more exotic grains like millet.
</P>
<P>
In a taste test of the new Chips Ahoy version and
the original, The New York Times Dining section gave the
whole-grain cookies a thumbs-up. While testers said that the texture
was more akin to an oatmeal cookie than a chocolate
chip cookie, they said it was an overall "better-tasting cookie,"
with a "toasty and nutty flavor." They also found that
the new cookie tasted slightly less sweet than the original.
</P>
<P>
Kelly Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and
Obesity at Yale University and a frequent critic of food
companies, applauded Kraft for making the change, but he worried
that consumers might fall into what some call the "Snackwell
effect." When these low-fat cookies were introduced in 1992, many
consumers used the low-fat billing to give themselves license to
eat unmodest amounts. Like whole-grain Chips Ahoy and Fig Newtons,
Snackwells are not low in calories.
</P>
<P>
"The population certainly needs more whole grains, but the optimum delivery
vehicle is not cookies," Brownell said. Still, Margo Wootan, nutrition
director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
gave Kraft credit for adding some nutrition to what was
previously empty calories.
</P>
<P>
"It's impressive that Kraft was able to do two 100 percent
whole-grain cookies," Wootan said. She added that many General Mills
cereals, which are packaged in boxes featuring a large whole-grain
banner, are made using a blend of whole grain and
refined grains, not 100 percent whole grain.
</P>
<P>
Kraft, the country's largest packaged food company, says it will continue
its push to develop healthier foods. It has also come
out with whole-grain Wheat Thins and in the next few
weeks, Kraft will start selling a whole-grain version of its
macaroni and cheese. But the product will not be made
using 100 percent whole grains and will have eight grams
of whole grains per serving.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Kraft also announced that it would expand its policy changes
for marketing to children to the company's Internet sites. Kraft
runs two Web sites that feature games and promotions in
which its brands are prominently displayed.

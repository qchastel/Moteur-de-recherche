The food served in California schools will be healthier under legislation signed
by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
The new laws impose a campus ban on the sale of sodas, set a new nutritional
standard for vending-machine snacks, and require more fruits and vegetables in
meal planning.
</P>
<P>
The former bodybuilding champion and fitness expert said the new rules are all
part of a new effort to fight childhood obesity.
</P>
<P>
"California is facing an obesity epidemic," Schwarzenegger said Thursday at a
conference on childhood obesity. "And more and more, children are becoming part
of the problem."
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers made California the first state in the nation to ban the sale of soft
drinks in middle and elementary schools two years ago. One of the bills signed
by the governor Thursday will expand that ban to include high
schools.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in July 2007, students will be allowed to buy only water, milk, and
some fruit and sport drinks that have limited sweeteners.
</P>
<P>
The governor also signed a bill that will raise nutritional standards for foods
sold in school vending machines and regulate the number of calories that can
come from fat and sugar. It also takes effect in July 2007.
</P>
<P>
Another bill provides $18.2 million (euro14.9 million) during this fiscal year
to offer more fruits and vegetables in school meal programs.
</P>
<P>
The California bills set a new standard nationally for healthy school foods,
according to the Washington D.C.-based Center for Science in the Public
Interest.
</P>
<P>
"Coke, Pepsi and other junk-food marketers enjoy being in schools because they
know it is one of the only places they can target kids without parental
interference," said Margo Wootan, the center's nutritional policy director said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"But in California, parents have clearly had enough, and leaders of both parties
took notice," she said.
</P>
<P>
Susan Neely, president of the American Beverage Association, called the ban on
sodas "unnecessary" and said that students and parents would have been better
served by a voluntary program.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this complex problem would be more effectively addressed by
educating students on the importance of living a balanced lifestyle," Neely said
in a statement.

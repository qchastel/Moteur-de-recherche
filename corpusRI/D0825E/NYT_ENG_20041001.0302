NICKELODEON TELLS KIDS TO GO OUT AND PLAY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vanessa Jones' oldest child was regularly falling asleep to the
television, and her youngest begged to go to Dairy Queen to get a toy
advertised on TV.
</P>
<P>
Jones, a stay-at-home mother,, responded by banning television except
on weekends. She and her friends are increasingly concerned about
children's television -- the commercials, the programming and the
fact that kids are just sitting there instead of playing.
</P>
<P>
This weekend they are getting some help from an unlikely source:
Nickelodeon, the No.1 network for children, is replacing its usual
Saturday afternoon lineup with a message encouraging young viewers to
go outside and play.
</P>
<P>
The move by Nick comes at a time when networks face a backlash over
the potentially negative impacts of TV viewing. High-profile reports
have linked television watching to childhood obesity, for example.
</P>
<P>
That has left children's networks -- including the No. 2 player --
Cartoon Network -- with a tricky balancing act. After all, their
revenue models depend on children watching plenty of television,
which includes commercials for junk food.
</P>
<P>
They also make money when they package their characters with food
products, such as Kraft's SpongeBob SquarePants macaroni-and-cheese,
featuring the Nickelodeon character.
</P>
<P>
Marva Smalls, executive vice president for public affairs at
Nickelodeon, acknowledged that awareness about childhood obesity is
up, but said the network's initiatives were not a response to outside
pressure.
</P>
<P>
"What's good for kids is good for business," she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to today's programming hiatus -- in which there will be
no kids' shows from noon to 3 p.m. -- Nick has sponsored "Let's Just
Play" events across the country, and is awarding grants to schools to
expand physical play.
</P>
<P>
The network also is working on a policy to require food products
featuring Nickelodeon characters to have additional nutritional
information on packaging.
</P>
<P>
The network says it will not lose significant revenue today, because
it can shift the schedule to air commercials at other times. However,
Nickelodeon is investing tens of millions of dollars on the overall
campaign, Smalls said.
</P>
<P>
Competitors are likely to follow suit. The Cartoon Network, owned by
Turner Broadcasting System, said it plans to roll out its own program
targeting childhood obesity soon.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on a long-term program to deal with this issue but we
don't have all of the elements in place," said spokeswoman Laurie
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
Some critics are skeptical about how effective the networks' efforts
will be.
</P>
<P>
"If they really want to address childhood obesity, they would stop
marketing junk food to kids," said Susan Linn, author of "Consuming
Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood" and associate director of
the media center at Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
"I think what they are concerned about is regulation," she said.
</P>
<P>
Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science
in the Public Interest, expects media companies' efforts to be
"measured and just enough to keep the government and courts off their
backs."
</P>
<P>
But Jones applauds Nickelodeon for today's effort.
</P>
<P>
"Having something like that, if they are willing to make a sacrifice
even for three hours, that makes me willing to put up with some of
the other things," she said.
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Ziegler, a mother of two, said, "At least they are doing
something."
</P>
<P>
Ziegler allows her 7-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son to watch
television only on weekends.
</P>
<P>
A number of high-profile reports about the media's role in childhood
obesity have been issued in the last year, including:
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Medicine this week published a report commissioned
by Congress that called for more voluntary industry regulation of
marketing to children.
</P>
<P>
The American Psychological Association issued a report in February,
saying marketing to kids under 9 is inherently deceptive.
</P>
<P>
A Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation report, also released in
February, suggested a variety of actions, from reducing the time
children spend with television to increasing the media messages
promoting fitness and sound nutrition.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Science in the Public Interest came out with a report
in November 2003 that claims excessive television viewing contributes
to childhood obesity and calls for stricter regulations on
advertising.
</P>
<P>
In Congress, several pieces of legislation aiming to limit marketing
to children have been proposed.
</P>
<P>
And more litigation is likely, said John Banzhaf, a law professor at
George Washington University and a proponent for using the courts to
make industry more responsible on childhood obesity issues.
</P>
<P>
At a conference this summer on obesity litigation, sponsored by the
Public Health Advocacy Institute, Banzhaf heard discussion about
suing media companies that air misleading junk-food commercials, as
well as the food companies themselves.
</P>
<P>
"If we could go after Nickelodeon, the impact would be greater" than
winning lawsuits against food companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Smalls acknowledged that Nickelodeon is in the business of selling
advertising. "Ice cream, candy, cookies are a part of kids' lives,"
the network executive said.
</P>
<P>
However, Nickelodeon also is committed to providing nutritional
information to families, she said, on television as well as its Web
site, magazines and sponsored local events.

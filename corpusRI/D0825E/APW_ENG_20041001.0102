Panel of scientists says reversing childhood obesity requires
wide-ranging effort
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Schools, food makers, government agencies and families themselves
must work together to reverse the epidemic of childhood obesity, a
panel of scientists said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious Institute of Medicine called Thursday for the
wide-ranging effort that includes less time in front of television
and computer screens, changes in food labeling and advertising, more
school and community physical education programs and education to
help children make better choices.
</P>
<P>
"It is now critical to alter social norms and attitudes" so that
healthy eating behavior and physical activity become a routine part
of life, Dr. Jeffrey Koplan of Emory University in Atlanta, chairman
of the committee that prepared the recommendations, said Thursday at
a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"This report is calling for fundamental changes in our society,"
Koplan said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas N. Robinson of Stanford University said that many health
care providers are worried about the future as obese children age and
adult chronic diseases are beginning in the teen years and younger.
"Everything is affected by overweight," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this finally serves as the wake-up call we need to implement
a comprehensive solution to this epidemic that is hitting every
corner of America," said Sen. Tom Harkin who has pushed legislation
and research to improve school lunches and other dietary measures to
fight childhood obesity.
</P>
<P>
The report from the IOM, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences,
is the latest to focus on the sharp increase in childhood obesity.
Over the last 30 years the rate of childhood obesity has tripled
among youngsters aged 6 to 11 and has doubled for those aged 2 to 5
and 12 to 19, the institute reported.
</P>
<P>
"Obesity may be a personal issue, but at the same time, families,
communities and corporations all are adversely affected by obesity
and all bear responsibility for changing social norms to better
promote healthier lifestyles," added Koplan, former director of the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
Obesity can lead to increased likelihood of developing diabetes, high
blood pressure, sleep problems, high cholesterol, gallstones and
other problems.
</P>
<P>
"Things have changed ... pushing kids to eat more and be less
active," observed Dr. Stephen R. Daniels of Cincinnati Children's
Hospital Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear that the solution is not in any one place," said
Daniels, of the hospital's comprehensive weight management center.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately the major approach to this is prevention ... we have to
start early," he said, urging cooperation of family, community,
schools and industry.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the panel suggested that parents to limit kids' TV
hours, that schools provide healthier food, that restaurants offer
nutrition information and that communities provide more recreation
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, three U.S. Cabinet secretaries fanned out across the
country to promote healthier lifestyles, especially among young
people.
</P>
<P>
"The cities have got to set aside (safe) places for kids to get
outside and walk or even ride their bicycles," said Health and Human
Services Secretary Tommy Thompson. Also on the road promoting
healthier lifestyles were Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, Surgeon
General Richard Carmona and Education Secretary Rod Paige.
</P>
<P>
The IOM report calls for increased federal involvement, including
creation of an interdepartmental task force to coordinate activities,
developing nutrition standards for school food, setting guidelines
for advertising and marketing to children and increases in research
funding.
</P>
<P>
And it seconds Thompson's call for increased recreational facilities,
urging state and local governments and schools to expand
opportunities for physical activity, including providing more
facilities and more frequent and intense after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
Urban and suburban community designs that discourage walking and
other physical activities, such as communities without sidewalks, are
among the causes of the increase in youth obesity, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Other causes cited included increased use of convenience foods that
are high in fat and calories, less physical activity in school and
more leisure time spent in front of televisions and computer screens
instead of playing outdoors.

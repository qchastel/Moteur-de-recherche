<P>
Former US president Bill Clinton 
went to a Manhattan school Tuesday to announce a 10-year 
initiative to combat childhood obesity.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is recovering from quadruple bypass surgery and 
had to overcome his affinity for junk food, described the weight 
problem as a national epidemic and stressed that something had to 
be done to change the eating habits of America's young people.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, a partnership with the American Heart 
Association, will include working with the food and restaurant 
industry to promote change, increasing physical activity and 
nutrition at schools nationwide, said the former president.
</P>
<P>
The initiative also aims at creating a campaign to engage kids 
in making better choices and providing their parents with 
information on how to incorporate heart healthy activities and 
diets into their family routines.
</P>
<P>
"I feel so strongly about this," said Clinton, whose interest 
in the subject stems from his recent heart surgery. He said he was
alerted by the substantial numbers of children with so-called 
adult onset diabetes, simply due to their eating and exercise 
habits.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports indicate that nearly half of the city's 
elementary students are overweight. More than twice as many kids 
are overweight as in 1980, and overweight children and teens have 
a 70 percent chance of becoming overweight adults.

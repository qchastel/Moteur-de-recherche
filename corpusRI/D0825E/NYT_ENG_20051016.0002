THE GROCERY Manufacturers Association is fighting the imposition of strong state
standards requiring healthy foods to be served in Massachusetts schools.
Many systems in the state already encourage healthy eating, and
the Legislature should pass a law to make sure that
all do.
</P>
<P>
The national association of food and beverage companies opposing this worthy
idea insists that communities ought to have a choice about
whether to keep offering foods that tend to promote obesity.
But students are young, and schools ought to guide them
toward good eating habits, not just provide them a smorgasbord.
Besides, obesity is not a personal matter; it often becomes
a health problem for society at large.
</P>
<P>
"Restrictions do not educate," said the association in written testimony. But
they do, if accompanied by instruction in good nutrition and
if the food is well prepared so healthy eating becomes
a pleasant experience at an early age.
</P>
<P>
Sheila Parisien, director of food services in the Manchester Essex district,
favors education in proper nutrition but says schools need to
go beyond that. "We have got to practice what we
preach," she said in a telephone interview Wednesday. "The kids
are going to be taught to make the cafeteria-classroom connection."
</P>
<P>
Parisien said many districts have already improved their offerings to include
more fresh fruits and vegetables and fewer starches and sweets.
She points to her own Manchester Essex district, as well
as Gloucester, Somerville, Milton, Boston, and Worcester. What's good for
some ought to be done for all.
</P>
<P>
Parisien testified before the joint Public Health Committee last week in
her capacity as president of the School Nutrition Association of
Massachusetts, an alliance of food service directors. The association has
proposed improvements in the mandatory standards bill introduced by Representative
Peter Koutoujian of Newton.
</P>
<P>
Koutoujian is revising the bill. He plans to toughen the language
limiting sales of soft drinks and other calorie-laden products at
fund-raisers outside regular school hours. He will also adjust the
standards to conform to the guidelines offered by Massachusetts Action
for Healthy Kids, a public-private partnership devoted to reducing the
incidence of childhood obesity.
</P>
<P>
The reauthorization of the federal school lunch program, passed last year,
also mandates that school districts set standards, but it did
not specify what they should be. The Legislature needs to
approve the revised Koutoujian bill to implement the federal law.
Children are faced with choices about what to eat every
day, but schools are for education, and students should be
offered only those food choices that are high in nutrition
and low in the sugar, fat, and other empty calories
that promote obesity.

<P>
New Zealand's government ordered schools on Tuesday to ensure
children take extra physical education in a bid to fight growing
obesity.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced that the nation's
children would have to undertake one extra hour of physical activity
every week on top of what they already do as part of their school's
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
Mallard said he had been concerned to see physical activity among
young New Zealand children falling and obesity on the rise.
</P>
<P>
He was proposing a change in education regulations so that schools
treated physical activity as a priority.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the changes he said each child would take part in "at
least one hour of meaningful and high quality physical activity a
week".
</P>
<P>
Both state and private schools have physical education on their
curriculum, although it ranges from very little activity in some
schools to intensive programmes in others.
</P>
<P>
The move was prompted by research showing 31 percent of New Zealand
children are either overweight or obese and that more and more are
leading sedentary lives -- 13 percent of five-to 17-year-olds in 2001
compared with eight percent in 1997.

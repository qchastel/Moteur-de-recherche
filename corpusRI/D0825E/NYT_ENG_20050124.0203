The Sarasota Family YMCA is opening a new
fitness room aimed at promoting exercise and healthy habits for
kids.
</P>
<P>
The nation has identified childhood obesity as a critical public health
epidemic and the YMCA has set aside space to help
children combat the problem.
</P>
<P>
The exercise room for kids ages 7 to 13 features smaller
versions of the fitness equipment used by adults.
</P>
<P>
Officials converted a conference room in the Bari Brooks Teen Center
at the Frank G. Berlin Sr. Branch on Euclid Avenue
into the Youth Fitness Center, which opened in December.
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit organization spent $28,000 on more than a dozen resistance
and cardiovascular machines for the tricep, bicep, shoulder, back and
leg muscles.
</P>
<P>
The young people have access to free weights and stability balls,
and there is an area for stretching.
</P>
<P>
"We're giving them an atmosphere and environment that is kid-friendly, with
their music, equipment that is their size and quality instruction
to try to teach them to begin adopting healthy lifestyles,"
said Pam Conner, fitness director of the Berlin branch.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Surgeon General in 2001 issued a call to action
to tackle the rise of childhood obesity. Nine million children
over age 6 are obese, according to health statistics.
</P>
<P>
Sarasota County schools provide time for physical education or personal fitness
classes, said supervisor Rick Westover.
</P>
<P>
Most high schools have weight rooms, and some middle schools have
upgraded their fitness areas, said Sue Pryer-Bell, Sarasota Middle School's
physical education teacher.
</P>
<P>
Research now shows that younger children can participate in fitness training
other than sports, if taught how to do it correctly.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Westcott, a fitness expert in Massachusetts, said the benefits are
stronger muscles and bones at an earlier age. Fitness training
can reduce common sports-related injuries and help children with weight
problems.

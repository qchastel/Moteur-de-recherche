A Russian mini-submarine that was trapped for nearly three days under the
Pacific Ocean surfaced Sunday with all seven people aboard alive after a British
remote-controlled vehicle cut away the undersea cables that had snarled
it.
</P>
<P>
All seven aboard the AS-28 mini-submarine appeared to be in satisfactory
condition, naval spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said. They were examined in the
clinic of a naval ship, then transferred to a larger vessel to return to the
mainland.

"The crew opened the hatch themselves, exited the vessel and climbed aboard a
speedboat," Rear Adm. Vladimir Pepelyayev, deputy head of the naval general
staff, told reporters. "Preliminary indications are that their condition is
satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
"I can only thank our English colleagues for their joint wok and the help they
gave in order to complete this operation within the time we had available _ that
is, before the oxygen reserves ran out," he said.
</P>
<P>
The sub surfaced at around 4:26 p.m. local time (0126 GMT), some three days
after becoming stranded in 190 meters (600 feet) of water off the Pacific Coast
on Thursday. It was carrying six sailors and a representative of the company
that manufactured it.

Earlier, a British remote-controlled Super Scorpio cut away the cables that had
snarled the 44-foot (13.2-meter) mini-submarine in Beryozovaya Bay, about 15
kilometers (10 miles) off the east coast of the Kamchatka peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The British vehicle was sent after the navy appealed for international help _ a
sharp contrast to the sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk in August 2000,
when authorities held off asking for outside assistance for days. All 118 aboard
the Kursk died.
</P>
<P>
The United States also dispatched a crew and three underwater vehicles to
Kamchatka at Russia's request, but they were not deployed at the accident
site.
</P>
<P>
In an echo of the Kursk sinking, President Vladimir Putin had made no public
comment by Sunday on the mini-sub drama. Putin in remaining on vacation as the
Kursk disaster unfolded, raising criticism that he appeared either callous or
ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov traveled to Kamchatka on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the mini-submarine was participating in a combat training
exercise and got snarled on an underwater antenna assembly that is part of a
coastal monitoring system. The system was anchored with a weight of about 60
metric tons (66 short tons), according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Russia's cash-strapped navy apparently lacks rescue vehicles capable of
operating at the depth where the sub was stranded, and officials say it was too
deep for divers to reach or the crew to swim out on their own. An earlier
attempt to drag the vessel to shallower waters failed when cables detached after
pulling it some 60 meters (65 yards).
</P>
<P>
The new crisis indicated that promises by Putin to improve the navy's equipment
apparently have had little effect. He was sharply criticized for his slow
response to the Kursk crisis and reluctance to accept foreign
assistance.

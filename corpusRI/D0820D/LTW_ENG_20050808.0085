Seven sailors rescued from a
mini-submarine hours before their air supply would have run out faced
a new problem Monday: Confined to a hospital, they wanted out.
</P>
<P>
``The crew were almost complaining about being put in a general
ward. `We're OK, we just want to go home,''' a correspondent for
Rossiya television reported in a newscast.
</P>
<P>
The men, trapped 600 feet under the Bering Sea, were rescued Sunday
after a remote-controlled British ``Scorpio'' underwater craft cut
through cables and fishing nets that had ensnared their mini-sub since
Thursday. They had an estimated six to 12 hours of air remaining when
they finally surfaced.
</P>
<P>
They also had been running short of water, the men said Monday in
comments on Rossiya and NTV television.
</P>
<P>
``We weren't out of water, we just didn't have enough of it,'' said
crew member Alexander Uybin. ``We were short of oxygen, too. Not
badly, but we could feel in our bodies that we weren't getting
enough.''
</P>
<P>
Uybin said his first wish when the mini-sub surfaced was ``to take
a breath of fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
A reporter asked what they had most wanted when they reached a
rescue ship. One of the men called out, ``To eat.''
</P>
<P>
``Yes, to eat!'' Uybin agreed.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Bolonin, a representative of the company that made the
43-foot AS-28 mini-submarine, said the men had simply tried to be
patient.
</P>
<P>
``We realized we were on the bottom and reported it,'' he said.
``All we could do was wait for whatever decisions were taken. After
we'd said we were stuck, we just lay down and waited.''
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in the craft reportedly were about 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, and the men tried to share their body heat during the
ordeal. ``We put on (thermal) diving overalls, and when you are
keeping very close together, you get warm,'' Bolonin said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov told reporters that Russia has
robotic vehicles similar to the British Scorpio, but it would have
taken longer to bring them to the scene.
</P>
<P>
``Our mini-subs even eclipse Scorpios in some specifications, but
trail them in mobility,'' Ivanov said at a news conference in
Vilyuchinsk, in the Kamchatka region. ``Air-lifting of our deep-water
robots to Kamchatka would have taken much more time.''
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said a special commission already had been appointed to
analyze actions by the Pacific Fleet and the Defense Ministry, and
added that those involved would undergo a thorough debriefing.
</P>
<P>
There has been criticism that the Russian navy initially tried to
keep the accident secret, and reports that news of it leaked out,
triggering foreign help, only when word was spread by relatives of the
trapped men.
</P>
<P>
``The main thing is that the people are alive,'' Ivanov said at the
news conference. ``They are alive thanks to their personal stamina and
bravery, as well as thanks to efforts of Russian and foreign rescuers
who jointly carried out a unique operation.''
</P>
<P>
NTV television reported that the cost of the rescue for the
Russians alone was estimated by navy headquarters at about $1.5
million. Foreign partners had not made any requests for reimbursement,
it said.

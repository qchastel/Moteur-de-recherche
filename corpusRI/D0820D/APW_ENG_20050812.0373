Russia's naval chief of staff said Friday that the navy will buy a
remote-controlled underwater vehicle similar to the one flown in by Britain to
help free a mini-submarine that was trapped with seven men aboard deep in the
Pacific Ocean.

Although the seven survived the four-day ordeal, the accident and Russia's
appeal for outside help underlined the navy's insufficient equipment.

Adm. Vladimir Masorin said the navy would buy a US$3 million (euro2.5 million)
Panther, which he described as a more modern device than the Scorpio sent by
Britain that succeeded in cutting through cables that had snagged the
mini-sub.

On Tuesday, Pacific Fleet commander Adm. Viktor Fyodorov said Russia would buy
two Scorpios, but Masorin's announcement indicated that the Panther would be
bought in place of one Scorpio.

The RIA-Novosti news agency quoted Masorin as saying Russia tried to deploy a
remote-controlled underwater vehicle called a Venom at the accident site, "but
when they started to use it, they used it incorrectly _ it was spoiled by our
people."

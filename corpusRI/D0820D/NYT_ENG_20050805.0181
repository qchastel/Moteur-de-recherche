The Russian navy worked desperately on Friday to save
a small military submarine that had sunk to the seafloor
off Russia's Pacific coast, and called for international help to
rescue the crew. The seven men on board were said
to have as little as 24 hours of air.

<P>
The submarine, a 44-foot-long vessel known as a Priz that was
itself designed for undersea rescue operations, became imperiled Thursday, the
Russian Navy said, after its propeller became entangled in an
undersea object during an exercise.
</P>
<P>
It sank to the bottom in more than 600 feet of
water off the Kamchatka Peninsula in Beryozovaya Bay. Although the
initial reports indicated that the submarine was tangled in a
fishing net, late Friday here the Russian navy said it
might have become stuck against an undersea piece of military
equipment that it was inspecting.
</P>
<P>
The navy said throughout Friday that it was in contact with
the trapped crew members, who were in good health, and
that it was sweeping the area with the anchors of
two surface vessels, trying either to snag the submarine or
to sever the debris that had crippled it.
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, the navy said one of the vessels had snagged
the submarine and was trying to tow it to shallower
waters, where divers might reach it and determine what might
be done next.
</P>
<P>
Adm. Viktor D. Fyodorov, commander of Russia's Pacific Fleet, announced on
the NTV television station that the vessel had managed to
drag the Priz 1 kilometer, or six-tenths of a mile,
along the sea floor. He hoped the submarine would be
in a better position for a rescue attempt within eight
hours, which would be noon Saturday in Russia's Far East.
</P>
<P>
"The crew members are alive and confirm that they are watching
the work of our rescue forces," he said. "We continue
the work of rescuing our comrades."
</P>
<P>
The situation was grave. The vessel remained at a depth out
of reach of divers, and far too deep for the
crew to try to escape independently. The navy also seemed
unsure of the extent of the remaining air supply, with
senior naval officers and spokesmen releasing estimates to Russian news
agencies that ranged from 24 hours to several days.

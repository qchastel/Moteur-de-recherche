Russian prosecutors have opened a criminal case against a naval captain accused
of negligence in the efforts to rescue a mini-submarine stranded off the
country's Pacific coast earlier this month, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Fleet's deputy military prosecutor, Roman Kolbanov, said the officer
had damaged an underwater remote-controlled vehicle through lack of
professionalism. The officer was not identified by name.
</P>
<P>
The Venom vehicle was similar to the Scorpio submersible flown in by Britain to
help free the mini-submarine, which was trapped with seven men aboard deep in
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The Venom's breakdown meant that the rescue operation cost an additional 10
million rubles (US$353,000, euro285,000), the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's naval chief of staff Adm. Vladimir Masorin said Friday that the Russian
rescue team tried to deploy the Venom at the accident site, "but when they
started to use it, they used it incorrectly _ it was spoiled by our
people."
</P>
<P>
Masorin also said the navy would buy a US$3 million (euro2.5 million) Panther,
which he described as a more modern device than the Scorpio. The Scorpio
provided by Britain succeeded in cutting through cables that had trapped the
mini-sub near the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
Although the seven survived the three-day ordeal, the accident and Russia's
appeal for outside help underlined the navy's insufficient rescue
capabilities.

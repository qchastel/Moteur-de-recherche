Russian sailors rescued with British help after three days trapped in a
mini-submarine deep in the Pacific revealed Monday how they struggled with
rapidly decreasing water and oxygen supplies while waiting anxiously in the
darkness and cold.
</P>
<P>
The seven men had only six hours of oxygen left when they finally reached the
surface, said Commander Ian Riches, the British naval officer who directed the
effort to use a remote-controlled Scorpio underwater vehicle to free the
submarine from fishing nets.
</P>
<P>
Strolling in the sunshine outside a military clinic, dressed in blue hospital
uniforms, the submariners offered the first glimpse of the conditions for the
seven men inside the cramped 13.4-meter (44-foot) submarine, snagged by cables
in 180 meters (590 feet) of water off Russia's remote Pacific
coast.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing was the lack of water. There was also a problem with oxygen, not
critical but the body felt it was not enough," crew member Alexander Uibin said
in footage broadcast on Rossiya television.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted a medical official in Kamchatka as saying that
the crew only had three or four gulps of water a day. The official, who was not
identified by name, said the submariners had written farewell letters to their
families several hours after their vessel became stranded on Thursday, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"We understood we were trapped. We just had to wait for a decision. When they
said that they've put everything into action, we lay flat and began to wait,"
said Gennady Volonin, a representative of the company that made the AS-28
mini-submarine who was on board with six submariners.
</P>
<P>
The men had worn thermal suits to protect them against temperatures of about 5 C
(40 F) and were told to lie flat and breathe as lightly as possible during the
rescue effort, officials said. To conserve electricity, lights were turned off
and contact with the surface was kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
The Scorpio, sent in response to Russia's urgent call for help, arrived Saturday
and spent six hours the next day cutting away the fishing net cables that had
snarled the Russian vessel and its propeller.
</P>
<P>
After breaking free, a few anxious minutes followed before the vessel floated up
to the surface, and the seven men climbed out onto the deck.
</P>
<P>
"The team are over the moon that we have got these guys out alive," said Riches
as he arrived ashore at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the early hours of
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities thanked the British and praised the international rescue
effort that included the United States, having appealed for help in a
significant gesture to its former Cold War enemies.
</P>
<P>
But Moscow newspapers still criticized the Russian navy for waiting more than a
day before revealing the submarine accident, accusing it of failing to learn the
lessons of the 2000 Kursk submarine disaster and not investing necessary funds
in upgrading rescue capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The Kommersant daily reported that the news only leaked out after a submariner's
wife made an anonymous call to a radio station in Kamchatka on Friday morning _
nearly 24 hours after the mini-sub radioed an emergency signal.
</P>
<P>
Later that day, Russia asked Japan, Britain and the United States for
help.
</P>
<P>
When the Kursk nuclear submarine sank in August 2000, Russian authorities held
off asking for outside assistance until hope was nearly exhausted; all 118 crew
members died.
</P>
<P>
"As with the Kursk, the navy command tried to cover up information about the
accident, trying to deal with it themselves," the Gazeta daily wrote. "Only when
the situation got critical did the navy top brass appeal to foreign countries
for help."
</P>
<P>
President Vladimir Putin was criticized at the time of the Kursk sinking for
reluctance to seek international help and for remaining on vacation as the
disaster unfolded. As of Monday, he had made no public comment on the mini-sub
drama.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov defended the navy's rescue capabilities, saying
Russia has a robotic vehicle similar to the Scorpio deployed at the Northern
Fleet. He said disassembling it for transport to an airport and then flying it
across the sprawling country would have taken longer than it took for the
British vessel to arrive.
</P>
<P>
But the Pacific Fleet commander, Adm. Viktor Fyodorov was quoted by Interfax on
Monday as saying that despite boasting a powerful submarine fleet, the Russian
navy did not have the proper resources to mount underwater rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
Putin ordered the defense minister to launch an investigation and Kommersant
reported Monday, citing military sources, that navy chief Admiral Vladimir
Kuroyedov faced dismissal after this latest embarrassment for the
fleet.
</P>
<P>
Later Monday, Putin called British Prime Minister Tony Blair to express his
gratitude for the British contribution to the rescue, the Kremlin said in a
statement.

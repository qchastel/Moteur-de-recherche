<P>
President Vladimir Putin on Sunday fired the head of Russia's Navy, Adm.
Vladimir Kuroyedov, and called on the new commander to boost discipline in
Russia's flagging fleet.
</P>
<P>
Putin did not give a specific reason for firing Kuroyedov. But he indicated that
the admiral was bearing the blame for a series of tragedies in the Russian
navy.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a mini-sub with seven men aboard was trapped at the bottom of the
Pacific Ocean. The Navy had no means of rescuing them without emergency help
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Kuroyedov had presided over the Navy as it has suffered tragedy _ including the
2000 Kursk submarine sinking that killed 118 crew members _ and embarrassment,
including his statement last year that a Russian nuclear-powered missile cruiser
was in such dire condition that it could explode at any moment. He was forced to
retract the statement.
</P>
<P>
Putin named Adm. Vladimir Masorin to replace Kuroyedov.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting at his suburban residence with the two admirals and Russian Defense
Minister Sergei Ivanov, Putin told Kuroyedov that the Navy he inherited when he
took command in 1997 was in poor shape and that it had showed signs of
improvement.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, there were difficult events, tragedies," Putin said during
the meeting, which was attended by reporters. "But I would like to underline
once again that with all these problems, all these tragedies, the main thing is
that the Navy is undergoing a revival."
</P>
<P>
He told Masorin that he faced a difficult task, in spite of progress.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen the level of training of Navy pilots and sailors, which has grown.
Many naval ships have been repaired and others were launched and some of them
were already commissioned," Putin said. "We would not be able to solve all these
problems even with the state's economic potential growing if we do not
strengthen discipline and order and solve tasks of social protection of
seamen."
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Kursk sinking, the August mini-sub crisis ended with all seven
crewmen surviving unhurt _ thanks to an underwater robotic vehicle sent from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The need for foreign help underlined the troubles of a Navy that once was
formidable but has fallen prey to money shortages and, many critics say, poor
leadership. Sea rescue vehicles were among the first Soviet-built vessels to be
scrapped amid the desperate funding shortages that followed the 1991 Soviet
collapse, but the Kursk tragedy had prompted promises that rescue vehicles would
be given priority.
</P>
<P>
But in August 2003, nine members of a 10-man crew died when the submarine they
were in sank in gale-force winds in the Barents Sea as it was being towed to a
scrapyard. Kuroyedov said at the time that the sinking could have been avoided
easily and there had been several chances to save the crew. He blamed
lower-ranking officials for disregarding safety rules.
</P>
<P>
Putin on Sunday presented orders for bravery to the seven mini-sub crewmen and
state awards to eight foreigners _ five Britons, one Japanese and two Americans
_ who assisted the rescue effort. Putin's order said the foreigners' awards were
"for the self-sacrifice and high professionalism show during the rescue of the
Russian seamen."

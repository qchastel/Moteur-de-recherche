At Moscow's request, Japan has dispatched four naval vessels to help rescue a
Russian submarine snagged on the floor of the Pacific Ocean, but the ships
aren't expected to arrive at the scene until early next week.

The ships include one submarine tender and three minesweepers, Marine Self
Defense Force spokesman Hidetsubu Iwamasa said. The submarine tender, which is
equipped with rescue gear, left from Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo and is
expected to rendezvous with the other ships at the site off Russia's Pacific
coast on Monday or Tuesday, he said.

Russia asked for the assistance Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official
said separately on condition of anonymity. The Russian submarine had been
tending an underwater antenna mounted to the sea floor when it became snagged on
a wire helping to stabilize a ventilation cable attached to the antenna, the
official said.

Russian navy officials said the mini-submarine, trapped at a depth of 190 meters
(625 feet), had seven sailors aboard, and it was unclear how long their oxygen
supply would last.

Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said the U.S. Navy has also been asked for
assistance, the RIA-Novosti news agency reported. Interfax said Russia's Pacific
Fleet commander was in talks with top U.S. Navy officers over how the United
States might help.

In televised comments, Pacific Fleet spokesman Capt. Alexander Kosolapov said
there was contact with the sailors, who were not hurt, and that authorities were
preparing to send down a similar vessel to assess the situation.

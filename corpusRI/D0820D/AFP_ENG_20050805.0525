A top Russian naval commander said Friday 
that a tugboat had attached tow cables to a Russian mini-submarine 
trapped on the seabed off Russia's Pacific coast, but he and other 
officials afterwards backed away from that assertion and said they 
were still checking.
</P>
<P>
The effort to attach the cables marked the start of an operation 
to raise the vessel trapped 190 metres (623 feet) below the surface 
with seven crewmen on board, Admiral Viktor Fyodorov, commander of 
Russia's Pacific fleet, told Russian media.
</P>
<P>
He said cables had successfully been attached to the stricken 
vessel and efforts were under way to begin towing it to shallow 
water.
</P>
<P>
He was subsequently quoted by Interfax news agency as saying 
that attachment of the cables to the mini-submarine was not certain 
and that a video camera was being lowered to find out what the 
cables were attached to.
</P>
<P>
"Then we can tell 100 percent that it's the submarine. And only 
then can we say that we carried out our task," Fyodorov said.
</P>
<P>
The plan, he said, was to attach the cables to the submarine and 
tow it 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the point where it became 
trapped, Fyodorov said.
</P>
<P>
The submarine, used in rescue, research and 
intelligence-gathering missions, became stuck at the bottom of the 
Bay of Berezovaya off Russia's Far East coast when its propeller was 
caught in a fishing net on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov said earlier that the seven crewmen were in 
satisfactory condition and had been instructed to remain horizontal 
in order to preserve their strength and reduce their consumption of 
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Japan and the United States were all due to provide 
assistance in the rescue operation. The incident is a chilling 
reminder of the sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine in August 
2000 that killed all 118 crew members following an emergency 
response effort widely criticised as sluggish.

RUSSIAN MINI-SUB WAS CAUGHT ON HUGE LISTENING DEVICE

The small Russian submarine rescued Sunday had become trapped beneath the
Pacific when an old fishing net disabled its propeller and
tied the vessel to an undersea Russian surveillance device larger
than a drive-in movie screen, according to American divers who
helped save the boat's seven crew members.

<P>
The divers, who spoke by telephone shortly after returning to San
Diego Monday, said the submarine had been knotted so tightly
against the listening device that a British submersible could not
maneuver close enough to clip all the netting during the
tense, five-hour operation to free the craft.

<P>
Instead, after the British vessel's robotic arm had snipped most of
the snarled netting, Russian commanders on a nearby ship ordered
the submarine's crew to blow pressurized air through its ballast
tanks. That lightened the submarine, the divers said, and propelled
it upward with enough force to break the last thick
strands of nylon pinning it down.

Four U.S. Navy divers were on a ship to help with
the rescue. In telephone interviews, two of them said the
Russian vessel floated to the surface from a depth of
625 feet off Russia's Kamchatka peninsula. Though the ascent was
uncontrolled, it popped safely to the surface between two rescue
ships "out of pure luck," said one of the divers,
Lt. Cmdr. Gerard Demers.

The account by the divers helped to sort out contradictory reports
by Russian officials during the three-day race to reach the
submarine before the sailors, huddled in the cold and dark,
ran out of air.

After the 44-foot-long vessel became trapped Thursday, Russian fleet commanders first
said it was entwined in a fishing net.
</P>

But by Friday, some officials had shifted to saying that it
was snagged on cables connected to an undersea antenna meant
to detect foreign submarines lurking off a major Russian naval
base nearby. The device is thought to be a large
hydrophone, which scans the depths for the sounds of submarines,
and it seems to be a vestige of Cold War
cat-and-mouse games beneath the sea.
</P>
<P>
The divers, from the Navy's Deep Submergence Unit in San Diego,
flew to the site on Friday with tons of rescue
gear, including two American submersibles. The British vessel arrived first,
and the American divers accompanied it to the rescue scene.

<P>
Western officials have said the Russian sailors were rescued about three
to six hours before they would have run out of
air.

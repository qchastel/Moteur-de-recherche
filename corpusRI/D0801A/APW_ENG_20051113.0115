Airbus will pay millions of dollars in compensation to airlines hit by delays in
delivery of the European plane maker's new A380 superjumbo, a senior executive
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Airbus chief operating officer John Leahy refused to give specific details of
compensation.
</P>
<P>
"The airplane costs about US$285 million (euro243.65 million) a copy, so I think
it is safe to say we are talking a couple of million dollars," Leahy told
Australia's Nine Network.
</P>
<P>
"But let's not get into detail that's confidential between us and the customer,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Qantas has ordered 12 of the A380 jets and is in negotiations for compensation
after their delivery was shunted back by about six months to April
2007.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Airlines, which has ordered 10 of the jets, has complained about an
eight-month delay in delivery to November 2006 and Malaysia Airlines, which has
ordered six planes, also is unhappy with the postponement.
</P>
<P>
Qantas executive general manager John Borghetti gave the giant jet an
enthusiastic reception.
</P>
<P>
"This aircraft will do for aviation what the (Boeing) 747 did some 30 to 35
years ago," Borghetti told reporters after the landing.
</P>
<P>
"Even in economy class, every seat will be bigger, everybody will have more
room," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Qantas would have first, business and economy classes in its A380s,
meaning the planes would carry just under 500 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Leahy said Airbus already is close to selling 250 A380s, a number that will
allow the company to break even on its development costs.
</P>
<P>
"We are essentially there now," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have 159 firm orders and I have got about 100 options that are blocking
delivery slots, most of them over the next five years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leahy was speaking as an A380, the world's largest passenger jet, flew low over
Sydney Harbour on the second leg of its three-city tour of Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus A380 flew over the harbor and its famous bridge and opera house
before touching down at Sydney Airport.
</P>
<P>
The giant plane was decked out in Qantas markings along its side but still
carried the Airbus logo on its tail.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, thousands of spectators turned out to watch the A380 touched down
in Australia for the first time at Brisbane Airport after an overnight flight
from Singapore, where it arrived Friday on the first leg of an Asian tour to woo
new customers.
</P>
<P>
The white jet, as tall as a seven-story building and stretching about
three-quarters of the length of a soccer field, is designed to carry 555
passengers but can be stretched to accommodate 800, Airbus says.
</P>
<P>
By 2006, 20 airports will be ready for the A380 including Singapore, Melbourne,
Kuala Lumpur, Sydney, Paris, Dubai and New York. By 2008, 38 airports will be
ready and 60 by 2010, Airbus said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Six other carriers in the region have ordered A380s. The 49 Asian and Australian
orders make up 31 percent of 159 firm orders for the superjumbos.
</P>
<P>
The A380 prototype was originally due to arrive Tuesday in Singapore but Airbus
postponed the trip to replace two of the plane's four engines.
</P>
<P>
The plane that arrived in Sydney was to fly to the southern city of Melbourne on
Monday before returning to Brisbane to be the center point of 85th birthday
celebrations for Qantas. It was to depart for Asia on Wednesday.

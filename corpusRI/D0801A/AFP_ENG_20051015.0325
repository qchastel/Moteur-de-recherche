<P>
The European aircraft manufacturer 
Airbus cannot produce enough of its A380 superjumbos to satisfy 
heavy demand, its commercial director said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I could sell another 30 A380s between now and 2010 if we had 
the production capacity," John Leahy told German Sunday newspaper 
Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, Airbus said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The European producer has taken 149 firm orders and 10 options 
from 16 clients for the A380, the largest commercial plane made 
yet.
</P>
<P>
The superjumbo, which can seat between 555 and 840 passengers, 
made its successful maiden test flight on April 27 and will fly its 
first long-haul test run to Asia and Australia next month.
</P>
<P>
In June, Airbus raised the aircraft's catalogue price by 10 
million dollars to an average of 292 million dollars (242 million 
euros).
</P>
<P>
Singapore Airlines will be the first to receive the new model, 
with the first orders delivered in late 2006, following earlier 
production delays.
</P>
<P>
With Airbus and rival US manufacturer Boeing locked in a 
transatlantic trade dispute over aviation subsidies, the French 
government has criticised as unreasonable a US safety review of the 
A380, which could recommend greater distances around the super-jumbo 
for fear of slipstream turbulence.

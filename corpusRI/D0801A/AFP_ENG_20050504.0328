The superjumbo Airbus A380, the 
world's largest commercial airliner, took off Wednesday into cloudy 
skies over southwestern France for its second test flight.
</P>
<P>
The European aircraft maker, based in the French city of 
Toulouse, said the second flight -- which came exactly a week after 
the A380's highly anticipated maiden voyage -- would last about four 
hours.

<P>
As opposed to the international media hype that surrounded last 
week's flight, with hundreds of journalists on site to capture the 
historic moment, Airbus chose to conduct Wednesday's test more 
discreetly.
</P>
<P>
"This second test flight is part of a program of tests that will 
intensify from here on out, and we're not gonig to make statements 
on each phase of the program," Airbus said.
</P>
<P>
A third flight is planned for later this week, probably on 
Saturday, followed by three flights next week, a company source told 
AFP.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, Wednesday's flight may be at an 
altitude slightly higher than the some 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) 
achieved in the first flight, and could climb up to 13,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
The double-decker airliner, capable of carrying up to 800 
passengers, is a key factor in Airbus's battle with US aircraft 
maker Boeing for market dominance.

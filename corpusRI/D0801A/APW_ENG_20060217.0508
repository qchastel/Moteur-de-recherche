The Airbus A380 superjumbo will enter service later this year as scheduled
despite the rupture of a wing during ground tests, the European aircraft maker
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Airbus spokeswoman Barbara Kracht said the wings of the 555-seater may require
"refinements at certain points" as a result of the fracture, which happened
Tuesday during ground testing in Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
"It should have no impact on the certification and delivery," Kracht
said.
</P>
<P>
Before certifying an airliner for commercial service, aviation authorities set
its "limit loads" _ the maximum strain each part is likely to be placed under
during extreme turbulence or hard landings. New planes are required to resist
loads of 1.5 times the limit.
</P>
<P>
The A380 wing had been bent upward by 7.4 meters (24.3 feet) at the tip,
reaching 1.45 times its limit load _ or 3.3 percent short of target _ when the
rupture appeared in a section between the two engines, Kracht
said.
</P>
<P>
Airbus engineers and officials from the European Aviation Safety Agency and U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration will decide what if any modifications are
required, she said. "We will need to find out from the data what is really
needed, but it's certainly not a redesign of the wing."
</P>
<P>
The A380 is due to enter into service with Singapore Airlines Ltd. by the end of
the year _ already six months behind its original schedule.
</P>
<P>
Shares in Airbus parent European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. opened 1.2
percent lower Friday on Euronext, but had recovered to euro31.58 (US$37.45) by
early afternoon, up 1.5 percent.

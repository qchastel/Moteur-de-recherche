US aviation officials to study A380 turbulence

<P>
US aviation officials are studying the 
potential for turbulence generated by the new Airbus A380 superjumbo 
jet that might require special safety regulations, an agency 
spokeswoman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Laura Brown said the 
agency is reviewing the question of turbulence generated by the jet 
capable of carrying 800 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Brown said that while nothing has been decided, the agency has 
set up a working group to make recommendations to the International 
Civil Aviation Organization, the agency that oversees aviation 
internationally.
</P>
<P>
"There won't be any separate US standards that are set for the 
A380, other than the international standards decided by ICAO," Brown 
said.
</P>
<P>
She added that experts would make recommendations before 
February to the ICAO, well ahead of the launch of the European-made 
superjumbo.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that US officials may 
try to require increased distances around the A380 as an added 
safety precaution, while noting that the issue may be clouded by 
transatlantic trade disputes over aviation subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The first A380 aircraft are expected to be delivered in late 
2006 as the European consortium tries to capture a niche for high 
capacity, long-range aircraft with a plane much larger than Boeing 
747, currently the largest passenger jet on the market.
</P>
<P>
An Airbus spokesman in France said the company has begun to 
measure turbulence in the wake of the A380 but that studies are not 
complete.
</P>
<P>
"The bigger the aircraft, the heavier it is and thus it is 
logical that turbulence could be more significant," the Airbus 
spokesman said, while adding that the maker has designed the plane 
"to minimize this effect."

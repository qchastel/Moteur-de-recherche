European aircraft manufacturer 
Airbus is confident of obtaining certification for its double-decker 
A380 airliner despite the failure of a wing during stress testing, a 
company official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Tests were rather good. We are confident the test will prove 
satisfactory to obtain the certification at the end of the year," 
said Charles Champion, director of the program.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Airlines is scheduled to receive its first A380s in 
November when it becomes the first carrier to fly the biggest 
commercial airliner ever built.
</P>
<P>
Airbus has previously said the new A380 would still enter 
service later this year despite the fact that a wing fractured 
during ground testing in France last week.
</P>
<P>
All new models of commercial aircraft are subjected to testing, 
including being able to withstand 1.5 times the maximum strain that 
parts of the plane would be subjected to in extreme conditions like 
a hard landing.
</P>
<P>
The A380 wing was about three percent from the target when the 
wing ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't even sure we need to reinforce the structure. 
Probably we won't. If we do, we are talking about a few kilos 
(pounds)," Champion said on the sidelines of a news conference 
during Asian Aerospace, the world's third-largest airshow.

After fanfare, Airbus A380 now must prove it can fly

<P>
After its glitzy debut, the new Airbus 
super-jumbo jet A380 now must prove soon it can fly, and eventually 
turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
Airbus unveiled the world's biggest passenger jet Tuesday at a 
spectacular sound-and-light ceremony in Toulouse, southern France, 
where the leaders of France, Britain, Germany and Spain cheered 
Airbus's latest victory over Boeing for aviation dominance.
</P>
<P>
The spotlight moment came as Airbus celebrates its second 
straight year of besting Boeing in global aircraft sales, and an 
estimated 57 percent share of the passenger aircraft market.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony in Toulouse, where Airbus is based, the 
company's chief executive Noel Forgeard indicated the maiden test 
flight for the A380 would be held in late March or early April.
</P>
<P>
But the exact date will be kept under wraps to "not put pressure 
on the test pilots," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, time is short for the grandest project envisioned by the 
European aircraft maker to take a reality test. The Airbus flagship 
is due to enter service next year.
</P>
<P>
The stakes could hardly be higher.
</P>
<P>
The development cost of the project amounts to 10.7 billion 
euros (13.9 billion dollars), borne by Airbus which is 80 percent 
owned by the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company and 20 
percent by BAE Systems of Britain.
</P>
<P>
Airbus expects the project will break even in 2008 with the sales are a must for test pilots.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it's true that we have a parachute on our backs and an 
evacuation hatch," he said in the radio interview. "Perhaps not for 
the first flight, but for the later ones in which we'll test the 
plane's vibration norms and we try very, very high speeds to test 
its limits compared with normal flight, there is a little more 
risk."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the date for the test flights, Lelaie replied: "We 
will fly when the plane is ready. As for us, we are ready."
</P>
<P>
The public will get its first look at the A380 super-jumbo jet 
at the Paris Air Show in June.
</P>
<P>
And the first commercial deliveries -- to Singapore Airlines -- 
are due in the first quarter of 2006.
</P>
<P>
The A380, which will break the monopoly held by Boeing's 747 on 
the super-jumbo market, represents a huge economic gamble for Airbus 
and symbolizes the emergence of Airbus as king of the skies.
</P>
<P>
The program, launched in December 2000, banks on a strategy of 
transporting huge numbers of passengers.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, for its part, is skeptical about the A380's commercial 
prospects and instead sees the need for long-distance, 
fuel-efficient flight, embodied in its future 7E7 plane.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the two rivals' differences on strategy, they do agree on 
at least one thing for their future planes: Both companies have 
chosen blue, grey and white color schemes.

Can Airports Accommodate the Giant Airbus A380?

One problem that Airbus is encountering with its new A380 is that
the craft pushes the envelope on the maximum size of a commercial
airplane. International airport standards call for no plane to exceed
80 meters in length and width. The A380 has a wingspan of 79.8 meters
(262 feet). The new plane is so much larger than any other craft that
most airports face the daunting prospect of making design changes to
accommodate it.

Six airlines plan to put Los Angeles International on their first
flight routes for the A380. Carriers are worried that the airport may
not have enough gates for the plane, although airport officials said
they were committed to having at least two A380 gates next year. At
the moment, if two A380s tried to park side by side at Los Angeles'
existing gates, their wings would touch. San Francisco International
Airport has redesigned an existing terminal to accommodate the A380s,
hoping to lure flights away from Los Angeles.

If major airports are slow to support the new plane, airlines may
hesitate to buy more A380s. Airbus says it needs to sell 250 planes to
break even; some analysts believe the company must sell 325 to cover
its investment.

<P>
The German wing of European aircraft 
manufacturer Airbus on Friday denied a press report that it had 
delayed delivery of parts for the new superjumbo A380, which in turn 
had delayed the whole project.
</P>
<P>
"This is not true," said Tore Prang, a spokesman for 
Hamburg-based Deutsche Airbus.
</P>
<P>
He added: "What we have delivered, we delivered on time."
</P>
<P>
Airbus said this week that it would be two to six months late in 
delivering the eagerly awaited A380 to airlines.
</P>
<P>
Prang said Airbus's management had made that announcement after 
analysing the production timetable for the whole project, and that 
no one factor could be blamed for the delay.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper International Herald Tribune reported on Friday 
that production problems at one of Airbus's main parts plants in 
Germany was at the root of the problem, rather than any safety or 
quality issues.
</P>
<P>
Airbus has taken 144 orders and 10 options from 15 airlines at a 
catalogue price of 263-286 million dollars (213.8-232.5 million 
euros) each.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, the world's biggest airliner, with capacity for 
550 to 840 passengers, successfully made its maiden test flight on 
April 27.

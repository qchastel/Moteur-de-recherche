The long wait is over for Harry Potter's blind fans

Like millions of Harry Potter fans, Katherine Moss can't wait to get her fingers
on a copy of the sixth entry in J.K. Rowling's best-selling series.
</P>
<P>
And for once, the 16-year-old blind student won't have to wait months longer
than her sighted friends to dive into "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood
Prince."
</P>
<P>
The book goes on sale at midnight Friday. A Braille edition is due out three
days later _ much earlier than with previous Harry Potter books, thanks to a new
arrangement between the publisher, Scholastic Inc., and the National Braille
Press in Boston.
</P>
<P>
Moss, a student at the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, doesn't want
the book read aloud to her. She wants to savor each word of the text at her own
pace.
</P>
<P>
"When I read it in Braille, it takes me a lot longer," she said. "That's a good
thing. Usually, I don't want it to end. That's how much of a reader I
am."
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Scholastic provided the National Braille Press with an
advance copy of the Harry Potter book, which is kept under tight
wraps.
</P>
<P>
For the past two weeks, more than four dozen employees at the Boston printing
house have been working overtime to print a batch of 800 Braille copies of the
"Half-Blood Prince."
</P>
<P>
Tanya Holton, NBP's vice president of development, said it usually takes months,
if not a year or two, for published books to make it into Braille
form.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only book we have blitzed like this before, because readers are
clamoring for it," Holton said.
</P>
<P>
At 1,100 pages, the Braille edition is nearly twice as long as the hardcover
version. It comes in nine volumes, takes up 13 1/2 inches (34 centimeters) of
shelf space and weighs about 11 pounds (5 kilograms).
</P>
<P>
Each Braille book costs $62 (euro52) to produce, but the nonprofit NBP is
selling them for $17.99 (euro14.98) _ the same as Amazon.com, according to
Holton. A local lumber retailer donated $100,000 (euro83,292) to help make up
the difference.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about charity. It's about parity," Holton said. "We're not here to
make a profit. We're here to get books in the hands of children. A blind kid
deserves the same books as a sighted child."
</P>
<P>
A blind reader's options are relatively limited, however. Only 500 to 600 new
Braille titles are published each year _ only about 1 percent of all books
published, according to Kim Charlson, the Perkins School's library
director.
</P>
<P>
"Braille is such an important skill," said Charlson, who is blind. "Nothing
compares to a kid being able to read for themselves."
</P>
<P>
Moss is still waiting for a Braille version of Katherine Paterson's "Lyddie," a
1991 book about a young girl's struggle to survive poverty in 19th-century New
England.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of books aren't available in Braille," she said. "I don't like that. I
don't like that at all."
</P>
<P>
At the Perkins School, the waiting list for the new Harry Potter book already
has at least two dozen names. More than 300 people have pre-ordered the book
from NBP.
</P>
<P>
"It's so important for blind children to have access to the same cultural
phenomena at the same time as their peers," Holton said.

Booksellers across Portugal saw legions 
of Harry Potter fans flock to their shelves this weekend as the 
sixth book in the children's series first dreamt up when its British 
author lived in the country went on sale in translation at midnight 
on Friday.

Portuguese publishers Editorial Presenca have printed 150,000 
copies of the Portuguese-language version of J.K. Rowling's "Harry 
Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", which was first published 
worldwide in English in July.
</P>
<P>
It is a record first print run for a Portuguese-language version 
of the series, whose five first books have until now sold some 1.39 
million copies in Portugal, a nation of just over 10 million 
people.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people attended a midnight launch party for the 
book hosted by the publisher at the ruins of Lisbon's Gothic Carmo 
convent, which stands in testimony to an earthquake which leveled 
the city in 1755.
</P>
<P>
Many of the children who attended the event, which featured a 
light-show and other special effects, dressed as their favourite 
character from J.K. Rowling's series of books about a boy wizard at 
a boarding school.

Several bookstores, and five post offices, in Lisbon and 
second-city Oporto in the north opened their doors at midnight on 
Friday to sell the penultimate tome in the bestselling series.
</P>
<P>
State-owned post office CTT said it would deliver 3,500 copies 
of the book to homes across the country between Saturday and 
Monday.

The first book in the series, "Harry Potter and the 
Philosopher's Stone" sold over 400,000 copies alone in Portugal.

Rowling worked as an English teacher in Portugal in the 1990s, 
when she is said to have begun imagining the characters of the Harry 
Potter books.
</P>
<P>
Here books have sold more than 300 million copies worldwide in 
over 60 languages and the first three Potter books have already been 
made into blockbuster movies.

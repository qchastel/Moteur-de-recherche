<P>
British police said they arrested two men 
Friday in connection with the theft of the next instalment of the 
adventures of boy wizard Harry Potter, six weeks before its launch.
</P>
<P>
Police made the arrests after receiving reports of gunfire in 
the English city of Kettering where a journalist from the Sun 
newspaper reported he had met two men allegedly preparing to sell 
stolen copies of the new book.
</P>
<P>
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince," to be published July 
16, has sparked massive interest, with bookmakers offering bets 
since author JK Rowling announced nine months ago that a character 
in the series would be killed off.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Sun as well as the Daily Mirror newspaper said 
both had been contacted by someone claiming to have copies of the 
new book.
</P>
<P>
Both newspapers said they planned to meet the man in Kettering 
to make sure that the books were returned to the publishers. The Sun 
reported it had actually met two men in the case.
</P>
<P>
A Northamptonshire Police spokesman said they arrested two men 
after being contacted about the book.
</P>
<P>
"Two books were recovered and they are currently being held in 
secure circumstances as evidence," said a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Police said later that the two men arrested had both been 
charged with weapons offenses and with handling the stolen books, 
though they did not confirm Sun reports that shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
Both were released on police bail until early next week when 
they will appear before magistrates in Northamptonshire.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said: "We have charged a 37-year-old 
Kettering man with possession of an offensive weapon and with 
handling stolen property and a 19-year-old with theft and possession 
of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence."
</P>
<P>
"Both have been released on bail," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain issued a statement saying 
its client Rowling had won a court battle to stop the two men 
leaking details of her latest book after they were accused of 
attempting to sell copies of it.
</P>
<P>
Rowling is inviting 70 children from English-speaking nations to 
join her at Edinburgh Castle July 16 to launch her new book "Harry 
Potter and the Half-Blood Prince," the sixth in the series.
</P>
<P>
About 250 million Harry Potter books have been sold around the 
world, and "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" became one of 
the fastest-selling books in publishing history in 2003.

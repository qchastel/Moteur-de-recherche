The fantasy series by J.K. Rowling is quite popular in China. 
Although the publication of the Chinese edition of "Harry Potter: 
The Half Blood Prince" came out much faster than other translated 
versions, it was still not soon enough -- online editions of the 
book appeared only a month after the English original was 
launched.

According to the book's authorized publisher, People's 
Literature Publishing House, all the 800,000 copies of the first 
printing of Potter VI were distributed to hundreds of Xinhua 
Bookstore outlets across the country's major cities.

"We have to prepare to quickly issue the Chinese edition to 
thwart the pirates," said Wang Ruiqin, editor of the series of the
publishing company.

In order to beat pirates, the publishing house used a special 
kind of green paper as its cover and employed the state of the art
technology.

The government vowed on August 17 to curb pirates in book 
market, including Potter VI.

According to the Guangming book-lovers' website, the publisher 
launched the Chinese edition of the fifth Harry Potter book in 
September 2003, also just three months after the original came out
in June that year.

five book series have sold more than 7.14 million copies so far in
the mainland, with the average record hitting 1.43 million.

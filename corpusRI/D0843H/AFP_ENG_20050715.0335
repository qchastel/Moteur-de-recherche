EDINBURGH, July 15

<TEXT>
<P>
Seventy lucky children from 
Australia, Britain, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand and South 
Africa will mark the midnight launch of the next Harry Potter book 
with the boy wizard's creator J.K. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
The young group, aged eight to 16, won competitions in their 
home countries to attend an exclusive party at Edinburgh Castle, 
Scotland, which has been transformed into Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry to celebrate the release of "Harry Potter 
and the Half-Blood Prince".
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by their parents or guardians, the fans will be 
driven in horse-drawn carriages to the castle, where fire-eaters, 
jugglers and torch throwers are due to be performing outside.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 local school children are also expected to gather 
along the main road leading to the castle to await the arrival of 
Rowling, 39, who is expected to make a brief appearance shortly 
before witching hour strikes.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the sense of magic, a giant image of the front cover 
of the latest book -- which shows Potter and his headmaster 
Professor Albus Dumbledore, with wands poised, surrounded by fire -- 
will be beamed overhead.
</P>
<P>
The multi-millionaire author will then enter the castle with her 
70 young guests and their minders for the extravagant party, which 
is being thrown by Bloomsbury, the British publisher of the 
best-selling Potter series.
</P>
<P>
At one minute past midnight on Saturday morning (2301 GMT 
Friday), she will read them the first chapter of the sixth and 
penultimate volume of her world famous series about the magical 
adventures of Potter and his friends.
</P>
<P>
Following this, Rowling will give each child a signed copy of 
the book for them to read over the weekend before she meets them 
again on Sunday to answer some questions.
</P>
<P>
A special television show -- "Harry Potter at the Castle: Magic 
at Midnight" -- on the independent British channel ITV1 will follow 
the events live, with images also broadcast on a giant screen 
outside the castle.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Rowling, who rarely makes public appearances, will 
grant her only press conference about the launch to the 70 
youngsters who must then write up articles for the world's media.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a 14-year-old Welsh fan, Owen Jones, is due to 
conduct the only one-on-one interview with the author, which will be 
broadcast that evening.
</P>
<P>
While each of the competition winners will receive an 
autographed copy of the new book, the Scottish National Library said 
it would be given the first signed version on Saturday morning. The 
book will be the centrepiece of a special Harry Potter display in 
the front entrance of the Edinburgh building.

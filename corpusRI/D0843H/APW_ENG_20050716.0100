Thousands of Harry Potter fans across Asia donned black cloaks, witches' caps
and wire-rimmed glasses to cheer the arrival of the latest installment in the
boy-wizard's adventures.
</P>
<P>
Bookstores throughout Asia and Australia opened their doors early Saturday and
began handing out copies of "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince," the latest
volume in J.K. Rowling's wildly popular children's series, which has sold more
than 270 million copies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The launch was coordinated to occur simultaneously in bookstores across the
globe.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Potter fans crammed into one of central Sydney's largest bookstores
to snatch up their copies of the 607-page tome.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen-year-old Mohammed Jalili-Baleh said he couldn't wait to know what
adventures awaited him inside the cover of Rowling's latest book. He and a
friend spent more than 12 hours to be the first to get their
copies.
</P>
<P>
"I'm an obsessed fan," he said. "They grip you. When you read one sentence, you
don't want to put it down."
</P>
<P>
A global phenomenon, the Harry Potter books have been translated into 62
languages and have inspired a series of films. Rowling is now the richest woman
in Britain, with a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at US$1 billion (euro830
million).
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, a teenage boy leaned against a wall outside a bookstore and began
reading a copy immediately after buying it.
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Yip, 15, said she hates reading, but described herself as a "super fan"
of Harry Potter. "The story's really gripping, and I like the fact that the
characters are falling in love and getting more mature," she
said.
</P>
<P>
About 40 Potter fans gathered outside the Wangfujing Bookstore in downtown
Beijing early Saturday to buy hardcover copies in English for 178 yuan (US$21;
euro18) each. It sold 200 books in the first hour and had 4,000 in stock, said
spokeswoman Li Minyue.
</P>
<P>
The fantasy series is hugely popular in China. Pirated versions of the first
five books in the series and the movie spin-offs are widely available, but so
far the latest book appears to have evaded Chinese pirates.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, a line at a bookstore on the Orchard Road shopping belt grew
throughout the morning, but dwindled to just a handful of eager readers an hour
before the sale began.
</P>
<P>
"It's raining. And because you can order it beforehand with a discount, I think
many Singaporeans will take advantage of that instead," said April Lee, a
marketing manager and Potter fan.
</P>
<P>
Booksellers around the world have profited enormously from the Potter
phenomenon, which seems to grow with each new edition.
</P>
<P>
"Pre-orders of Harry Potter six have more than doubled that of the previous
Harry book," said Don Grover, the chief executive of the Dymocks Group of
Companies, one of Australia's largest chain of bookstores. "Harry Potter has
done wonders for children's literacy and for introducing children to the joys of
reading, which is great for children and great for the book industry."
</P>
<P>
Dymocks said it expects to sell more than 50,000 copies of the latest Potter
book on Saturday alone.
</P>
<P>
But the party must eventually come to an end.
</P>
<P>
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" is the penultimate book in Rowling's
seven-book series.
</P>
<P>
For Sydney resident Agnes Jang, 16, who came dressed head-to-toe as a student of
the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the end of the Potter era will
be a cause to mourn.
</P>
<P>
"It'll be very sad when she finishes writing the books," Jang said. "But Harry
has to move on."

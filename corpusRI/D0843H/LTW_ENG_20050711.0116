Pre-Orders for New Harry Potter Book Set Record
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four days remain until the release of the sixth Harry Potter book,
but it already has shattered at least one publishing record, experts
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Leading booksellers -- Barnes &amp; Noble Inc., Borders Group and
Amazon.com -- each reported that pre-orders for ``Harry Potter and the
Half-Blood Prince'' had outstripped those for its predecessor ``Harry
Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' or any other book they have
sold. ``Order of the Phoenix'' was the fastest-selling in history,
with 5 million copies purchased in 24 hours on June 21, 2003.

Barnes &amp; Noble executives said more than one million copies of the
latest tale about the bespectacled boy wizard had been reserved at its
660 stores and Web site. Amazon had received 850,101 orders to its
U.S. site as of 5:45 p.m. Monday, including those placed on
bordersgroup.com. A Borders spokeswoman, while declining to provide
details of orders from stores, said ``Half-Blood Prince'' had more
reserved copies than any other hardcover book.

``Harry Potter is definitely a phenomenon,'' said Laura Porco,
Amazon's group merchandising manager for books. ``We are prepared for
this because we've been through it before,'' she said, adding that the
retailer's best-selling products are the fourth, fifth and now sixth
book in the Potter series. Worldwide, Amazon has received about 1.2
million pre-orders for ``Half-Blood Prince.''

<P>
At Amazon's five warehouses across the nation, workers were
preparing the book for shipment under tight security. They must
present identification to enter the fenced-in area where copies are
kept under 24-hour guard. No other products sold by Amazon require
such measures, Porco said.

Looking at Amazon's procedures to ensure the latest Potter book
doesn't get out before its 12:01 a.m. Saturday release date, U.S.
Postal Service spokesman Gus Ruiz said, ``The Homeland Security
Department could learn something from this.''
</P>
<P>
Ruiz also said the Post Office had taken corrective actions after a
2003 mishap resulted in a few copies of ``Order of the Phoenix'' being
delivered to homes in advance of the official release.
</P>
<P>
Still, security was breached last week in British Columbia, Canada,
when a bookstore sold up to 15 copies of ``Half-Blood Prince.'' The
Canadian publisher, Raincoast Books, has secured a court injunction
barring anyone from leaking the plot and is offering bookplates signed
by author J.K. Rowling to people who return copies.

<P>
At Scholastic Corp., the U.S. publisher, executives are tracking
the pre-order activity to determine the need for additional copies;
the first printing totaled 10.8 million, up from 6.8 million for
``Order of the Phoenix.'' Spokeswoman Kyle Good said, ``We are
continuing to monitor what's happening with sales in order to decide
on a second print run.''
</P>
<P>
Barnes &amp; Noble chief executive Steve Riggio noted that the
retailer's warehouses were working around the clock to fill the
pre-orders. He said, `` `Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' is
outselling the summer's blockbuster movies and it hasn't even landed
on shelves yet.''

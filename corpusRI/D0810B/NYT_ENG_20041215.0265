FANNIE MAE TOLD TO REVISE PROFIT

The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered
Fannie Mae, the nation's largest buyer of mortgages, to restate its
earnings over the last four years after concluding that it had
violated accounting rules on its treatment of derivatives and loans.
</P>
<P>
The agency's findings, announced Wednesday evening by Donald T.
Nicolaisen, its chief accountant, is a huge setback for the company
and its chairman and chief executive, Franklin D. Raines.
</P>
<P>
Fannie said last month that if it was found to be in violation of the
rules, it might have to report after-tax losses on its derivatives
transactions of as much as $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae, once the Federal National Mortgage Association before it
became known by its nickname, was created by the federal government
to promote home ownership. It does so by buying mortgages from banks
that issue them, allowing those banks to make further mortgages. That
huge secondary market helps keep interest rates low. Fannie Mae, now
privately owned, has become a giant in the process, with about $1
trillion in assets, and in the same league as Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
Chuck Greener, the company's top spokesman, said the commission's
decision "will have a negative impact on our minimum capital
position" but declined to quantify it.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to taking the steps necessary to comply with our
minimum capital requirement," Greener said. He said that the company
would also abide by the decision of the chief accountant. Analysts
have said that Fannie Mae could shore up its capital by selling some
of its mortgage portfolio or by a securities offering.
</P>
<P>
Nicolaisen said that the SEC investigation of Fannie Mae was
continuing. The Justice Department is also looking at the company's
accounting.
</P>
<P>
For Raines and his top advisers, however, Wednesday's announcement
could be ominous news.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the crisis at the company, Raines, a former budget
director in the Clinton administration, has continued to enjoy the
strong support of the company's board, which had retained its own
lawyers who also had not found any wrongdoing by Raines or the senior
management at the company.
</P>
<P>
But the board's confidence in Raines may now begin to erode with the
findings of the commission, and particularly if it faces a
significant restatement of earnings.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican who heads the House
Financial Services Committee, said on Wednesday that he would hold
hearings on Fannie Mae after Congress returns next month. At an Oct.
6 hearing, Raines appeared confident that the company would be
vindicated by the SEC and that it had been the victim of overzealous
regulators at a different agency, the Office of Federal Housing
Enterprise Oversight.
</P>
<P>
That agency, known as OFHEO, had concluded in a report a few weeks
earlier that Fannie Mae deliberately violated accounting rules and
engaged in "cookie jar" accounting, dipping into reserves or
postponing the recognition of expenses. The company did this, OFHEO
contended, to smooth out quarterly earnings, meet financial
projections and in 1998, at least, earn larger bonuses for its top
executives.
</P>
<P>
But Raines repeatedly assured skeptical lawmakers at the hearing that
Fannie Mae had complied with the accounting rules and that it would
be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
Nicolaisen's statement did not address many allegations raised by
OFHEO, like irregular accounting or manipulation of expenses and
earnings to earn larger management bonuses. But he concluded that
Fannie Mae had violated two accounting rules: one on accounting for
the costs of prepayment of loans and another on the accounting
treatment of derivatives that the company has used to reduce risks to
its portfolio from changes in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"Our review indicates that during the period under our review, from
2001 to mid-2004, Fannie Mae's accounting practices did not comply in
material respects with the accounting requirements" of the two rules,
Nicolaisen said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the dispute between Fannie Mae and its regulators is
a complex accounting rule, known as SFAS 133, a statement of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board. That rule requires companies to
account for derivative securities at market value but allows them to
keep those changes from affecting earnings if the derivatives are
used to hedge specified exposures.
</P>
<P>
The report by OFHEO concluded that Fannie Mae rode roughshod over the
rules, certifying that some hedges were "perfect hedges" when they
were not, and in other cases treated as hedges investments that did
not qualify for the treatment.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, Fannie Mae's documentation of hedges was not adequate,
and in other cases the documents were created retroactively, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange
Commission did not go into the same amount of detail as the report by
the housing regulator. But the statement appeared to support its
conclusions when it noted that "among other things, Fannie Mae's
methodology of assessing, measuring and documenting hedge
ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported."
</P>
<P>
In response to the findings of OFHEO, the company's board decided in
September to increase its capital and change the way it accounts for
deferring some expenses and hedging transactions.

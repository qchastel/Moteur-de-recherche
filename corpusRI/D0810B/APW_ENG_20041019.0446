Fannie Mae announces formal SEC inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mortgage giant Fannie Mae is now the target of a formal inquiry by
the Securities and Exchange Commission over its accounting practices,
the company said in a regulatory filing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry, which was previously an informal investigation, means
that federal regulators may now subpoena documents from the company
as well as require the testimony of company employees and executives.
In its filing with the SEC, the company said it would cooperate fully
with the probe. Formal investigations require a vote of approval from
the SEC's commissioners.

<P>
Fannie Mae, which last week was ordered by the Justice Department to
preserve documents as part of a criminal investigation, has been
accused of manipulating its accounting practices in order to meet
Wall Street earnings expectations.
</P>
<P>
Since word of the SEC's informal investigation broke Sept. 22, the
company has also been sued by a number of shareholders, claiming that
the actions of company executives has harmed shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before Congress earlier this month, chairman and chief
executive Franklin Raines and chief financial officer Timothy Howard
said Fannie Mae did nothing wrong in its accounting and insisted that
the regulators' allegations represent an arguable interpretation of
complex rules. They specifically denied the allegation that, in an
instance in 1998, accounting rules were deliberately violated so that
top executives could collect full bonuses.
</P>
<P>
Washington-based Fannie Mae is the second-largest financial
institution in the United States behind Citigroup Inc. It and its
smaller sibling Freddie Mac pump money into the home mortgage market
by buying and guaranteeing repayment of billions of dollars of home
loans each year from banks and other lenders, then bundling them into
securities that are resold to investors. Their stock and debt are
widely held by investors worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Freddie Mac restated some $4.5 billion in earnings, ousted
top executives and was fined a record $125 million in a settlement
with federal regulators. Its restatement of earnings, which mostly
had been understated, prompted regulators to examine Fannie Mae's
accounting.
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae fell $1.04 to $67.76 on the New York Stock Exchange on
Tuesday, and slumped another $1.97 to $65.79 in after-hours trading.

A SEISMIC SHIFT UNDER THE HOUSE OF FANNIE MAE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From a compulsively neat desk inside a company that routinely jousts
with powerful critics from the White House, Congress, the Federal
Reserve and Wall Street, J. Timothy Howard has been the financial
architect of one of the world's most formidable and most elegantly
designed corporate money machines. He also holds a corporate title
that in recent years has emerged as one of the most treacherous in
American business: chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
The winds of scandal that uprooted Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and other
companies often blew hardest through CFO suites. Now, with
controversy engulfing his employer -- the mortgage giant Fannie Mae
-- Howard finds himself in legal and regulatory cross hairs that
threaten to upend his career, throw the company's operations into
turmoil and escalate a long-running battle between Fannie Mae and its
enemies.
</P>
<P>
Eleven days ago, a federal regulator issued a scathing report that
accused the company, and Howard in particular, of accounting and
managerial lapses that presented a false public portrait of its
financial well-being and enriched its executives. Then, late last
week, amid a mounting tempest of congressional criticism, Fannie Mae
became the subject of a criminal investigation by the Justice
Department; that investigation is likely to take precedence over a
continuing Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The stakes in all of this are large. Fannie Mae provides much of the
glue that helps hold the American mortgage market together, and if
the company encounters serious setbacks, the impact on homeowners and
the world's financial markets could be unpleasant. Nor are the
accusations of improprieties necessarily unique to Fannie Mae. Wall
Street analysts say that if the same regulatory magnifying glass were
used to examine the operations of most other sizable mortgage
concerns in America, a case for dubious accounting could probably be
made for many of them.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the problems in recent financial scandals, issues raised by
Fannie Mae's regulators appear largely to pertain to unwieldy
accounting rules that are open to widely divergent interpretations --
not to sham transactions designed to cloak corporate malfeasance.
More serious accounting problems may yet emerge, and the company has
already been forced to consider outsized financial restatements as a
result of the regulatory inquiry. And as the Justice Department
investigation of Fannie Mae continues, other problems may surface.
</P>
<P>
Few longtime observers of Fannie Mae and of Howard expect that crimes
will be found. "The guy is as honest as the day is long, and the
targeting of Tim Howard is an unfortunate byproduct of larger
events," said Martin D. Eakes, chief executive of the Self-Help
Credit Union, a lender to low-income borrowers based in Durham, N.C.,
who has alternately worked closely with and battled Fannie Mae on
various mortgage issues. "This will never, ever be like Enron. Mark
my words."
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. But the confrontation between Fannie Mae and its critics
already amounts to a clash of titans, both in Washington and New
York, where Fannie Mae's lobbyists and its executives are accustomed
to striding unencumbered through the halls of Congress, the financial
byways of Wall Street and the finest dining rooms and clubs.
</P>
<P>
For at least the last decade, the company has been criticized in
Congress and by Washington research groups. Detractors accuse it of
benefiting unfairly from its status as a quasi-public enterprise, of
not truly meeting its mission of providing affordable housing and of
being too loosely regulated. More recently, Fannie Mae's explosive
growth has drawn the attention of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, who raised concerns earlier this year that a collapse or
trouble for the company posed threats to the economy. Greenspan
advocated the complete privatization of the company, a view that has
been pressed elsewhere in Washington as well.
</P>
<P>
"It's a resistance to Fannie in Washington that is one part mortgage
industry civil war, one part conservative ideological crusade to try
to rein them in or force them to privatize," said Charles A. Gabriel
Jr., senior Washington analyst at Prudential Securities. "Having
faced down the mortgage industry civil war and the ideologues, what
finally tripped them up is they ran afoul of the shifting zeitgeist
on accounting."
</P>
<P>
Amid all of this, Howard and Fannie Mae's chief executive, Franklin
D. Raines, have left a long trail of embittered opponents who have
complained about high-handedness. "They are a study of power in
Washington," said Andrew M. Cuomo, who sparred with Fannie Mae on
housing issues as a former secretary of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development. "Once the myth of invincibility is gone, the act
crumbles."
</P>
<P>
Although Fannie Mae and its executives have not been shy in the past
about taking on their critics, neither Howard nor Raines has been
available for interviews about the regulatory review and
investigations of the company. Both men are scheduled to testify on
Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee, and they
will be thrust into the uncomfortable and unusual position of having
to defend themselves and their actions.
</P>
<P>
"This has become a big-time game," said Bert Ely, a banking analyst
in Alexandria, Va., and a longtime Fannie Mae critic. "It is one of
the big power struggles under way right now. One of things that makes
it that way is all the tumult and disturbing news, and issues that
will not be resolved for months."
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae is a behemoth in the mortgage business. It can borrow
money more cheaply than its competitors in the mortgage business
because investors, and lenders believe that there is an implicit
guarantee that the government will offer financial support to Fannie
Mae if the company ever swooned.
</P>
<P>
And the company's vast operations have helped keep mortgage rates
low. Rather than lending money to prospective homeowners, Fannie Mae
buys mortgages from banks that issue them, allowing lenders to make
further mortgages. Fannie Mae's size, and its government backing,
also allow home buyers in the United States to have mortgages with
rates that are guaranteed for as long as 30 years, a financial
benefit that is unavailable in most other countries, where banks
typically recalculate mortgage rates monthly.
</P>
<P>
Raines has been Fannie Mae's chief executive and corporate ambassador
since 1999. But Howard has a far longer tenure at the company and has
overseen much of the machinery that has caused Fannie Mae's coffers
to swell.
</P>
<P>
As chief financial officer since 1990, Howard has worked alongside
three chief executives and three chief operating officers. During
that time, Fannie Mae rebounded from a spate of financial turmoil to
post earnings of $7.9 billion last year -- a 71 percent leap from
$4.6 billion in 2002. Its loan losses have plunged over the last
decade, and its mortgage portfolio has expanded to about $900 billion
last year from about $200 billion in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The financial fortress that Fannie Mae has become is largely the
handiwork of Howard and a highly skilled team of deputies who
surround him. As CFO, Howard introduced new methods of managing the
company's debt and overseeing its funds, including deploying
high-octane financial tools known as derivatives that companies of
every stripe use to insulate their operations from risks and
unforeseen economic shocks. Howard's financial wizardry has won many
admirers on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
"In my experience, I would put him in the higher ranks of CFOs at
financial companies," said Frederick N. Khedouri, a senior managing
director at Bear Stearns, an investment bank that has extensive
dealings with Fannie Mae. "Senior executives who know what the risks
are and how to manage the risks are extraordinarily valuable and
rare. Someone should think long and hard about who you would get who
would be better at this than Tim."
</P>
<P>
For all of Howard's intellectual abilities, his diplomatic skills are
described as lacking by current and former colleagues, financial
analysts, congressional aides and members of federal agencies that
have worked with Fannie Mae. In that regard, he may be a mirror of
Fannie Mae itself -- a well-oiled, highly calibrated machine that has
also attracted an unusual amount of enmity for being high-handed in
its dealings with outsiders. When he joined Fannie Mae as chief
economist in 1982, Howard was among a cadre of new hires brought in
by David O. Maxwell, then the chief executive. High, volatile
interest rates had brutalized the company and brought it to its
knees. The national housing market was in a crisis, and there was a
sense of public mission among the new hires -- that through the
shrewd use of sophisticated financial tools and strategic thinking
they would be able to resurrect the housing finance market.
</P>
<P>
That missionary zeal still pervades Fannie Mae. Financial analysts
say the company's executives regard themselves as stewards of the
housing market who have to fend off critics who might otherwise
disrupt its sensitive operations.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Howard was promoted from chief economist to head of asset
management, a position that allowed him to oversee the most
profitable and complex area of Fannie Mae's business, its enormous
mortgage portfolio. That job, said a former Fannie Mae employee, gave
him "the keys to the kingdom."
</P>
<P>
Despite his monklike work habits, Howard is described by
acquaintances as a family man, a devoted father heavily involved in
his children's activities. He owns an expensive home in the affluent
Washington suburb of McLean, Va., where he hones his tennis game on
his private court. He is also a patron of the arts and has been an
active supporter of the Washington National Opera, where he serves as
vice president and treasurer.
</P>
<P>
Within Fannie Mae, however, Howard has drawn a number of detractors.
He is regarded as aloof, according to several people who have
interacted with him at the company. They describe him as a sometimes
unrelenting perfectionist, and someone who is unremitting in his
oversight of his employees and their work -- occasionally, in his
early years as CFO, dressing down employees in front of their peers.
</P>
<P>
But others at the company say that he has grown into his job and that
his management style softened, especially after he became vice
chairman of Fannie Mae's board last year. "I worked with Tim for a
number of years and know him to be a person of extraordinarily high
integrity," said John Buckley, a former senior vice president at
Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
Howard's assumption of his vice chairman's title last year brought
him to the peak of his powers inside Fannie Mae. He became a member
of a four-member office of the chairman, a role that gives him a
voice in corporate strategy -- including the setting of Fannie Mae's
earning goals. He has also grown close to Raines, and their
second-floor offices are connected by a small conference room.
</P>
<P>
By late last year, Howard had assembled an impressive portfolio of
duties at Fannie Mae, essentially having responsibility for
overseeing how the company makes its money, how it counts its money
and how it audits that count. When a little-known and underfinanced
regulatory agency assigned to monitor Fannie Mae's operations came
calling earlier this year with pointed questions about how things
were being run, Howard was asked to describe his wide-ranging duties.
</P>
<P>
"Boy, how much time do we have?" Howard answered with a laugh,
according to a recent report prepared by the regulatory agency, the
Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, known as Ofheo.
</P>
<P>
In Washington's pecking order, Ofheo is low on the list, with a small
staff and few resources. To critics, the fact that Fannie Mae is not
overseen by a larger, more lushly funded regulator is a dangerous
problem.
</P>
<P>
"We've always maintained from the very beginning that there are
important regulatory and safety and soundness issues there," said
Beneva Schulte, a spokeswoman at FM Policy Focus, a Washington group
that is funded by financial services companies and other groups and
tracks Fannie Mae's operations. "There's no way they could keep
meeting their earnings targets without going outside their charter
into new lines of business or by being undercapitalized."
</P>
<P>
Ofheo's director, Armando Falcon Jr., began asking serious questions
about Fannie Mae's accounting practices after critics said his agency
failed to uncover accounting problems at Fannie Mae's sister agency,
Freddie Mac. According to members of federal agencies and others who
have interacted with Fannie Mae and Ofheo, Falcon bridled at Howard's
and Raines' reluctance to provide his agency with timely, detailed
and respectful replies to queries since he became Ofheo's director in
1999.
</P>
<P>
According to former Fannie Mae employees, Howard consolidated his
power by guarding information and by rarely delegating authority. He
adopted the same posture toward Ofheo, according to an individual
close to Falcon.
</P>
<P>
The friction among Howard, Raines and Falcon became personal, said
some who have witnessed their interactions. It was as if "Frank and
Tim had questioned Armando's manhood," said a financier who knows all
three men. An Ofheo spokeswoman acknowledged that there were problems
between Fannie Mae and Ofheo but said her agency had maintained "an
appropriate arm's-length relationship" with Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the backdrop, the report on Fannie Mae released by Falcon's
agency on Sept. 22 was caustic. In strong language unusual in a
regulatory report, it cited numerous examples of accounting
irregularities and managerial conflicts that Ofheo examiners
contended were used to doctor Fannie's earnings and inflate executive
compensation.
</P>
<P>
"If other companies used Fannie Mae's logic in applying accounting
principles, they could dictate the financial results they desired,
and there would be no comparability of financial results between
reporting entities even within the same industry," the report said in
one passage.
</P>
<P>
The brunt of the report's accusations are directed at Howard, who
Ofheo examiners described as the engineer of suspect accounting
machinations. The report accuses Howard of wearing so many different
corporate hats that financial controls and auditing practices were
potentially neutered at Fannie Mae. It also says Fannie Mae
improperly disregarded accounting standards relating to loan
originations and purchases as well as those related to derivatives
used to hedge risk in its vast mortgage portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The report accuses Fannie Mae of creating a "cookie jar" reserve that
Howard could dip into at his discretion to determine the amount of
income or expenses the company chose to recognize in any given
period. And the report cites other apparent machinations beginning in
1998 that helped bolster executive compensation at Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and financiers say a few of the accusations merit closer
scrutiny while most others do not rise to the level of being
improprieties -- much less crimes.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan E. Gray, a financial analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;
Co., said that while regulators might well have found important
technical infractions of accounting rules, Falcon's motivations had
to be considered. "You have a gentlemen that was told he is not
strong enough who now is both the prosecutor and judge," he said.
"The way to keep his job and keep his agency from being phased out
was to be tough."
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Gray said that there could be a significant problem if
Fannie Mae had a "cookie jar" reserve. But he dismissed most of the
other criticisms in the report as immaterial. He said the accusation
of problems with Fannie Mae's derivatives accounting might require
more attention, but he and many others in the financial services
industry said that the complex rules governing mortgage derivatives
created enormous compliance and financial management headaches with
which all CFOs were struggling.
</P>
<P>
The accounting maneuvers that the report says were used to fatten
management's wallets do focus an uncomfortable spotlight on Fannie
Mae's lush compensation practices. It also highlights the baronial
ways of an organization funded in part by taxpayers and with a
charter to help make housing available to low- and moderate-income
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Raines earned about $20 million in total compensation last year,
while Howard pulled in about $7.7 million. Since January, Howard has
also sold Fannie Mae stock worth about $6.95 million. A Fannie Mae
spokesman said that Howard's stock sales were all scheduled in
accordance with a routine sales plan adopted and filed with the SEC
in February.
</P>
<P>
With congressional scrutiny mounting, and the Justice Department
investigation now at hand, both Raines and Howard have something at
stake that is perhaps more precious to them than money: their
reputations.
</P>
<P>
In an unusual agreement with Ofheo reached last Friday, Fannie Mae
said it would institute major changes in its accounting and
management practices, including separating Howard's duties and
instituting new auditing procedures. The company also agreed to add
$5 billion in fresh funds to its capital reserve within the next nine
months, a move apparently intended to shore up its finances in
advance of any financial restatements.
</P>
<P>
That move, however, has not kept investigations from continuing. On
Wednesday, Raines and Howard will have a chance to air their views
before members of Congress. While the complicated nature of the
allegations have circumscribed the executives' abilities to speak
publicly about recent events, some analysts wonder why one of the
most muscular players in Washington has largely fallen silent.
</P>
<P>
"People are shaking their heads, old-timers like me are shaking their
heads and saying, 'What kind of game is Fannie playing here?"' Ely
said. "They have this circling-the-wagons mentality and are not
giving anybody, including their investors, a sense of where this is
going."

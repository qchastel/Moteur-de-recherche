ASSESSING WHAT WILL NOW HAPPEN TO FANNIE MAE

<P>
Fannie Mae, the housing-finance giant, for years has fended off
critics who contend that the company is too big, too powerful and too
risky. But the Securities and Exchange Commission's Wednesday ruling,
that Fannie Mae had seriously breached accounting rules, could touch
off a chain reaction that results in stricter government controls,
legislation limiting its growth, and possibly even a change in top
management.
</P>
<P>
Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike on Thursday demanded that
senior executives, including the chief executive, Franklin D. Raines,
return tens of millions of dollars in bonuses and other compensation
that they had earned based on inaccurate financial statements that
the company issued from 2001 until this year.
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae's board also met on Thursday to be briefed on the SEC's
order that it restate earnings and declare losses of as much as $9
billion as a result of the accounting violations. On Capitol Hill,
lawmakers vowed to swiftly overhaul the oversight of the federally
chartered company.
</P>
<P>
The board members concluded their unscheduled meeting early Thursday
evening without deciding whether to keep or remove Raines after the
announcement by the SEC's top accountant that the company had
violated two rules. That decision will now force the company to
restate its earnings and take steps to significantly raise its
capital level. Three board members, joined by Raines and other
regulators, had attended a briefing at the commission by its chief
accountant on Wednesday shortly before he announced his decision,
people at the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
But people involved in the inquiry said that board members know that
they cannot let the uncertainty hanging over Raines linger, both for
the sake of the company and the markets, and predicted that a
decision would be made soon.
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae, which for years has been one of the most formidable
political forces in Washington, maintained a low public profile. The
company declined to comment further about the findings of the SEC
staff or the remarks of lawmakers. Nor did it issue any statement in
support of its senior management.
</P>
<P>
In response to the findings of the commission, Democrats and
Republicans called on Raines and other executives to return their
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, Raines has made $14 million in salary and
bonus and has taken home $25.6 million in incentive pay. As of the
end of last year, he held options on 1.9 million shares of Fannie Mae
stock, valued at almost $12 million. Fannie Mae also paid almost
$200,000 for Raines' use of company transportation in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Howard, the company's chief financial officer, made $4.3
million in salary and bonus over the last three years and received
$7.4 million in incentive pay. At the end of last year, Howard held
options on 607,699 shares with a value of $11.5 million. Fannie Mae's
stock has fallen a bit since the end of 2003 when it was $75.06.
Thursday the shares closed at $69.30, down $1.39. It is impossible to
determine how many of the executives' options are exercisable at
current prices.
</P>
<P>
Securities lawyers said that it was murky whether a little-used
provision of the landmark corporate law that Congress adopted after
the scandals at Enron and other companies could force Raines and
Howard to forfeit the bonuses and incentive pay they had received.
</P>
<P>
The provision, Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, only
appears to apply to Fannie Mae starting in 2003, when it first filed
stock registration documents with the commission. The company, which
as a congressionally created organization enjoys benefits that other
public companies do not have, including an implicit financial
guarantee from the Treasury and an exemption from state and local
taxes, is exempt from federal securities laws. It reached an
agreement two years ago with the SEC to voluntarily comply with
securities rules beginning in 2003. Section 304, which has proven
troublesome to apply because of its vagueness, also requires a
finding of "misconduct," which the commission has not made.
</P>
<P>
That could change in coming months.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers involved in the Fannie Mae investigation underway at the
commission and at the Justice Department said that, now that the
commission's chief accountant has ruled, the SEC will focus more
sharply on the reasons for the violations and the conduct of top
executives.
</P>
<P>
Raines and other company officials have acknowledged that they
approved of the accounting treatment of derivatives and loan
prepayments that were the subject of the chief accountant's report.
But they have also challenged the conclusions of another agency, the
Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or OFHEO. That agency
precipitated the crisis at Fannie Mae when it found three months ago
that Fannie Mae violated accounting rules as part of an effort to
manipulate earnings and in at least one year, 1998, meet profit
targets that would trigger larger bonuses for executives.
</P>
<P>
Although lawmakers stopped short of seeking the ouster of Raines and
his top aides, some predicted their departure would likely be forced
by the company's board.
</P>
<P>
"I think the board is well out front and ahead on that issue," said
Rep. Richard H. Baker, R-La., who heads a subcommittee overseeing
Fannie Mae. He said that as a result of the findings of the
commission and OFHEO, "I think we'll have legislation on the
president's desk by summer time."
</P>
<P>
Baker also sent a letter to the SEC asking it to examine $200 million
in deferred expenses in 1998 and whether, as OFHEO concluded, it was
done to meet earnings projections that allowed executives to win
their maximum bonuses under an employee incentive program.
</P>
<P>
Even some of the company's strongest supporters appeared to be shaken
in their confidence of its management as a result of the findings.
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that any executive compensation was enhanced as a
result of inaccurate accounting, which led to the achievement of
particular earnings targets, it must be repaid to the corporation,"
said Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the
House Financial Services Committee and one of the company's most
vocal allies on Capitol Hill. "This didn't happen by accident. This
is defective corporate governance."
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said he would
reintroduce legislation that was not adopted this year but that would
strengthen the government's oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
The two companies, created by Congress, play a major role in the
economy by buying mortgages from banks and then either holding them
or selling them to investors as securities.

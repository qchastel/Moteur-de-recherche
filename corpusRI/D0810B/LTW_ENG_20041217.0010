The long battle between sense and Silicon Valley reached a
milestone Thursday, when federal regulators published a rule requiring
companies to account properly for stock options. High-tech firms
continue to argue that the best way to account for options is a matter
of opinion and that their opinion is as valid as the one regulators
arrived at after thousands of hours of consultation. But high tech's
highhandedness has nothing on the leadership at Fannie Mae. Bosses at
the federally chartered mortgage giant also formed their own opinion
of what an accounting rule should say. They did this not merely before
the rule in question went into effect -- but afterward.
</P>
<P>
This arrogance is almost as stunning as the $9 billion
overstatement of profits that resulted. Fannie's top managers looked
at the federal rule on accounting for futures, swaps and other such
financial instruments, and they decided they didn't agree with it.
They requested permission from regulators to go their own way, and
when this was denied they went their own way anyhow. They behaved like
a passenger who sees a ``No Smoking'' sign, checks with the conductor
that the sign means what it says, and then nonchalantly lights up.

We've all been pondering the Kerik question: How did President
Bush's serially flawed Homeland Security Department nominee imagine he
could survive the confirmation process? Fannie Mae's behavior raises
the same question: How did its managers believe they could get away
with this? Perhaps they hoped to hide behind financial complexity: For
a long time, critics have raised questions about Fannie's financial
soundness, and Fannie has fired back with firm denials. It was hard to
know whom to believe. In September a devastating report on Fannie put
the lender on the defensive. But Fannie's chief executive, Franklin
Raines, continued to raise the complexity defense, saying the
accounting weaknesses identified in the report were a matter of
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
Now the chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission
has ruled that the report was right and that Fannie had violated
accounting standards, overstating its profit by 38 percent since
January 2001. Tough consequences will follow: The Justice Department
is pursuing a criminal investigation; the SEC is pursuing a civil one;
the House promises hearings; and class-action lawsuits are in the
works. The price of Fannie's accounting hubris is going to be
significant.
</P>
<P>
But the most important response to Fannie Mae's humiliation goes
beyond punishment of individuals. Fannie Mae is the second-biggest
financial institution in the country, and its collapse could
destabilize financial markets and damage the economy. The September
report raised a question about ``the overall safety and soundness of
the enterprise,'' suggesting that a collapse is alarmingly
conceivable. Federal oversight of Fannie has traditionally been light,
not least because of the lender's clout in Congress. It's time to
invigorate it.

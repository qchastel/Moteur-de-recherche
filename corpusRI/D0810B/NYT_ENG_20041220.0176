ACCOUNTABILITY AT FANNIE MAE SHOULD START RIGHT THERE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you are responsible for massive amounts of accounting, maybe it's
not a good idea to criticize someone else's accounting.
</P>
<P>
You might end up like Fannie Mae CEO Franklin D. Raines.
</P>
<P>
Raines, 55, a former budget director under President Clinton, has
long held himself up as a paragon of corporate ethics. But now it
looks as if Raines is about $9 billion short at the company he runs.
</P>
<P>
The Federal National Mortgage Association, a.k.a. Fannie Mae, is a
government-sponsored private company and the largest source of funds
for the U.S. mortgage market. It holds nearly $1 trillion in debt,
making it the second-largest debtholder behind the government.
</P>
<P>
After an advisory from the Securities and Exchange Commission last
week, Fannie Mae is due for an earnings restatement that will erase
more than a third of its profits over the past three and a half
years. During this period, Raines made $14 million in salary and
bonus, plus $25.6 million in incentive pay.
</P>
<P>
Yet before the highly paid Raines was dodging his own accounting
scandal, he was wagging a finger at others.
</P>
<P>
Here's what he told Congress about Enron in 2002: "It is wholly
irresponsible and unacceptable for corporate leaders to say they did
not know ... about the operations and activities of their company,
particularly when it comes to risks that threaten the fundamental
viability of their company."
</P>
<P>
Then in January, Raines brought The Business Roundtable Institute for
Corporate Ethics to the University of Virginia. Raines is co-chairman
of the Roundtable, a club for CEOs from leading corporations. And who
better to pontificate about ethics than a bunch of CEOs who lord over
10 million employees?
</P>
<P>
"The CEOs of the Business Roundtable are aiming to make a lasting
contribution to business ethics and the way our companies are run,"
Raines said.
</P>
<P>
But what will be Raines' lasting contribution? Since accounting woes
surfaced at Fannie Mae, he argues that he relied on advice from
Fannie Mae's auditor, KPMG, and adhered to Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles, or GAAP. According to Monday's Wall Street
Journal, Raines privately makes the case that he did nothing at
Fannie Mae that warrants his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Does any of this sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
"Getting numbers wrong by $9 billion is someone's fault," said John
Bazley, an accounting professor at the University of Denver's Daniels
College of Business. "In this environment, it tends to put the CEO on
the spot."
</P>
<P>
Raines refuses to be put on the spot. Fannie Mae's regulator -- the
Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight -- alleged in
September that the company made errors. In October, Raines went
before Congress and denied the accusation. Then he went to the SEC
for a second opinion, only to be told last week that Fannie Mae
should restate earnings.
</P>
<P>
Accounting at Fannie Mae is complex. The area in which Fannie Mae
misstated earnings -- derivatives -- is exceedingly complex.
Derivatives are financial contracts that Fannie Mae uses to hedge
against interest rate fluctuations. Their value is derived from debt,
securities, currencies and commodities. Accounting for them involves
assumptions and predictions -- a thick realm of grey.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Raines believed Fannie Mae could hide in this complexity. But
the issue that the SEC addressed last week is simple. Essentially,
Fannie Mae didn't like the accounting rules regarding derivatives, so
it made up its own.
</P>
<P>
"Fannie Mae internally developed its own unique methodology," SEC
Chief Accountant Donald T. Nicolaisen wrote.
</P>
<P>
This would be like me as a taxpayer making up my own depreciation
schedules to calculate deductions instead of using those prescribed
by the government. It wouldn't hold up in an audit. Yet Raines signed
off on the books and defended the methods.
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae's board met Sunday night to discuss Raines' future. No
decision has been announced, but it's a possibility Raines and a few
others will be stepping down.
</P>
<P>
It's time for corporate leaders to quit paying lip service to the
ideals of corporate governance, ethics, integrity and transparency,
and just tell the truth in their financial statements.

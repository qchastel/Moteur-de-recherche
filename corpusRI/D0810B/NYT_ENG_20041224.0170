AT FANNIE, THE TIES THAT BLIND
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After hemming and hawing and bobbing and weaving, the board of
directors of Fannie Mae finally jettisoned Franklin D. Raines, the
mortgage finance giant's former chief executive, and Timothy Howard,
its former chief financial officer, last week. They appear to have
done so only under duress from Fannie's chief regulator, the Office
of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which in September put the
company on notice that its improper accounting had vastly overstated
profits and misrepresented its financial position.
</P>
<P>
The board's reluctance to defenestrate Raines and Howard, who appear
to have misstated their company's financial statements to the tune of
around $9 billion, fed suspicions that Fannie Mae's directors were
loyal to management first, and shareholders second.
</P>
<P>
Questions of allegiance were also raised when it became clear that
Fannie's directors allowed Raines to retire rather than to be fired
outright. That distinction means that he will reap millions of
dollars in benefits and stock awards that he may otherwise have lost.
Regulators are now investigating the compensation awarded to Fannie's
executives; Raines will receive an annual pension of more than $1
million under the terms of his exit.
</P>
<P>
With a new year approaching, it seems a perfect time for the Fannie
board to look hard and long at its own roles in the mess. But because
nobody ever takes responsibility for wrongdoing today -- especially
not high-powered directors of public companies -- a rigorous
self-analysis from Fannie's board is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Maybe we should do it for them.
</P>
<P>
Here's the question: Just how independent are Fannie Mae's
independent directors? Under its charter, it has 18 directors.
Thirteen are elected annually by shareholders, and five are appointed
by the president. Two presidential appointees were on the audit
committee at the end of 2003, but they are no longer associated with
the company. President Bush has declined to appoint new directors to
the board, leaving those seats vacant.
</P>
<P>
In any enormous accounting debacle, all eyes turn first to a
company's audit committee. The company considers all of them to be
independent.
</P>
<P>
As of last year, they included Thomas P. Gerrity, the chairman and a
former dean of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania;
Frederic V. Malek, the chairman of Thayer Capital Partners, a private
equity firm; Anne M. Mulcahy, the chief executive of Xerox; and Joe
K. Pickett, the retired chief executive of HomeSide International,
parent of a mortgage lending company. The two presidential appointees
on the committee at the time were Taylor C. Segue III, a lawyer in
Michigan at Howard &amp; Howard; and William R. Harvey, president of
Hampton University in Hampton, Va.
</P>
<P>
Fannie's audit committee is charged with overseeing the accounting,
reporting and financial practices of Fannie Mae, including the
integrity of its financial statements and its compliance with
regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>
Hmmm. Sound like they sort of fell down on the job? Yes, indeed, said
Greg Taxin, chief executive of Glass Lewis, an institutional advisory
firm that advised Fannie shareholders to vote against all audit
committee members up for re-election at Fannie Mae last year. "The
point of that committee is to protect shareholders from precisely
what happened here," he said. "This audit committee needs to be
replaced."
</P>
<P>
A Fannie Mae spokesman said that none of the company's directors were
available to comment for this article. Segue did not return a phone
call seeking comment and Harvey could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
Mulcahy left Fannie's board last September, a few days before OFHEO's
devastating report was made public. She joined the board of Citigroup
and said that she could not be a director at two financial services
concerns simultaneously. She can run, but because she became a
director at Fannie in 2000 she will not be able to hide from scrutiny
of the board's actions during the years it was found to have cooked
its books. A spokesman for Xerox did not return a request for comment
from Mulcahy.
</P>
<P>
While the audit committee members had an obligation to monitor
Fannie's accounting, they are not the only directors bearing
responsibility for the debacle at the company. The entire board
should don a hair shirt.
</P>
<P>
Take Ann Korologos. She is Fannie Mae's presiding director and the
person heading the special review committee of the board. Her tenure
at Fannie Mae has been long, since 1994. The vice chairwoman of the
RAND Corp. board of trustees and former secretary of labor under
President Ronald Reagan, Korologos must now oversee the investigation
of Fannie Mae's accounting practices, governance and structure and
executive compensation.
</P>
<P>
But Korologos' other affiliations show links to Fannie Mae. She is
chairwoman emeritus of the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit group in
Washington that has received $280,000 in grants from the Fannie Mae
Foundation, a nonprofit arm that works for affordable housing,
between 1996 and 2002. She was the institute's chairwoman for the
first four of those years.
</P>
<P>
Malek, another Fannie audit committee member, joins Korologos at
Aspen; he is an "active trustee" there.
</P>
<P>
(The Aspen Institute's original goal, according to its Web site, was
"for American business leaders to lift their sights above the
possessions which possess them, to confront their own nature as human
beings, to regain control over their own humanity by becoming more
self-aware, more self-correcting and hence more self-fulfilling.")
</P>
<P>
Korologos has also been a visiting fellow at the Urban Institute,
which has received $2.65 million in grants from the Fannie Mae
Foundation since 1990, and she sits on the corporate council of the
Conservation Fund, a nonprofit group that works to protect the
nation's land and water resources. The Conservation Fund has received
$54,000 from the Fannie Mae Foundation since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another recipient of Fannie Mae Foundation grants -- $125,000 since
1993 -- is the Federal City Council, a nonprofit organization based
in Washington that works to improve the city. Korologos was the
council's president from 1990 to 1995. And H. Patrick Swygert, the
president of Howard University and a Fannie director since 2000, also
has ties to the Federal City Council.
</P>
<P>
Fannie also considers Swygert to be independent. But Fannie employed
his son in its technology unit until late last spring. And since
1989, the Fannie Mae Foundation has dispensed 35 grants to Howard
University, totaling $555,186. Almost $400,000 of those grants went
to the university during the years that Swygert was sitting on
Fannie's board.
</P>
<P>
Then there is Malek, the private investor with close ties to Fannie
managers. He is a partner with Raines in the Washington Baseball
Club, which is bringing the Montreal Expos to the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
A Fannie spokesman said the company's criteria for independence were
far stricter than those of the New York Stock Exchange. Since the
company changed its guidelines in 2003, donations to charities with
which directors are affiliated do not exceed $100,000 a year. He said
the directors acted quickly and appropriately when its regulator,
OFHEO, made the findings of its investigation public. After the
Securities and Exchange Commission said it had agreed with OFHEO that
Fannie had misrepresented its financial position, the board chose to
act more deliberately to make sure the decisions it made were the
right ones, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It is altogether possible that Fannie Mae's board has acted entirely
properly and in the shareholders' interests at all times. But the
appearance of conflicts still resonates, especially in its lumbering
approach to ousting Raines and Howard.
</P>
<P>
"This board has all the classic hallmarks of a cozy, friendly board,"
Taxin, the institutional investors' adviser, said. "Everything from
the personal and professional relationships that go back many years
between all these people, to the charity and business relationships
that exist.
</P>
<P>
"After being accused of billion-dollar misstatements and having
received warnings from the regulator, this board really had to think
quite hard whether the CEO and CFO had to be fired. In this era, that
should have been a fairly easy decision to make."

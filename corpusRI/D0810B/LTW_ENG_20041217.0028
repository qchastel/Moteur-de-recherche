Baseball, AOL, Fannie: Raines Strikes Out
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been something of a bad week for Frank Raines.
</P>
<P>
First, the D.C. Council managed to unravel a carefully negotiated
deal to bring Major League Baseball back to Washington, which Raines,
as a leading member of the would-be local ownership group, has been
working on for years.
</P>
<P>
Then Time Warner and America Online agreed to pay more than half a
billion dollars to settle civil and criminal charges stemming from
allegedly fraudulent accounting practices dating to when AOL was a
separate company and Director Raines was a member of its audit
committee. Raines was also a member of the Time Warner audit committee
when those practices were vigorously defended after being exposed by
my intrepid colleague, Alec Klein, in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Securities and Exchange Commission concluded that
Fannie Mae, where Raines is chairman and chief executive, had engaged
in questionable accounting practices over the past four years --
practices that Raines stubbornly defended even after serious questions
had been raised.
</P>
<P>
My guess is that there will be plenty of quiet whispering around
the punch bowl at the annual Raines Christmas party this year.
</P>
<P>
In the baseball matter, of course, Raines is as much a victim of
the District's political bumbling as the rest of us. But what's
baffling about the two accounting imbroglios is how Raines and so many
other smart executives and professionals could have been so stupid.
</P>
<P>
Let's give the directors at Time Warner and AOL the benefit of the
doubt and assume that they knew nothing about the true nature of the
transactions with PurchasePro when a reporter from The Washington Post
showed up with documents suggesting they were a sham. What was a
director to do?
</P>
<P>
Considering that all this was happening in the wake of the
unfolding Enron scandal, the answer was pretty clear. You ask your
auditor, H. Stephen Hurst of Ernst &amp; Young, to review the transactions
again. And after Hurst reaffirms that they are kosher, you hire Thomas
Yannucci of Kirkland &amp; Ellis, a lawyer who specializes in defending
companies against unfavorable press stories, to relay these assurances
to The Post and argue against publishing Klein's story.
</P>
<P>
Now, two years and many subpoenas later, it turns out that Klein
was right and Time Warner shareholders are out $500 million. So can
someone please explain to me why Ernst &amp; Young is still Time Warner's
auditor and why Hurst is still licensed to certify accounts of public
companies? Or why Stephen Bollenbach, the Hilton hotels chief, and Fay
Vincent, the former baseball commissioner, are still on the Time
Warner audit committee? Or why any editor would believe Tom Yannucci
when he shows up to declare a company's virtue and demand that a story
not be published?
</P>
<P>
At Fannie Mae, Raines seemed to understand the stakes back in
October when he told a House committee he had checked and rechecked
his firm's accounting and would take personal responsibility for it.
So many questions had been raised about these issues over the past two
years that there are really only two possibilities: Raines either knew
that Fannie's accounting was questionable, which I doubt, or he should
have known, in which case he failed in his duty of care. In either
case, with $9 billion in reported profit in jeopardy, he is now
duty-bound to resign and take Chief Financial Officer Timothy Howard
with him.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as Fannie directors resume their urgent discussions this
weekend, they need to move quickly to replace KPMG as the company's
auditor for having provided them with bad advice. And the members of
the audit committee -- Tom Gerrity, the former dean of the Wharton
School of Management; mortgage banker Joe Pickett; and real estate
developer Stephen B. Ashley -- should seriously consider tendering
their resignations as well. Like Raines and the auditors, they are
selected and paid handsomely for their integrity and their good
judgment. With the mishandling of these accounting issues, one of
those qualities has been seriously called into question.

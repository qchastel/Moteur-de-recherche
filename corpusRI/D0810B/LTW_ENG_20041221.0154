Raines, Howard Out Under Pressure at Fannie Mae
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Franklin Raines stepped down Tuesday as chairman and
chief executive of Fannie Mae, as the company's directors ended days
of tense and emotional deliberations and bowed to pressure from
regulators who wanted him out.
</P>
<P>
J. Timothy Howard, the company's longtime chief financial officer,
also is leaving. Raines' departure was structured as an early
retirement. Howard resigned.
</P>
<P>
The departures come less than a week after the Securities and
Exchange Commission directed the giant mortgage-funding company to
make accounting corrections that could erase $9 billion of past
profit.
</P>
<P>
The Washington D.C.-based housing finance company, which stands
behind or owns a quarter of the nation's mortgages, faces a criminal
investigation by the Justice Department; a civil investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission; an ongoing probe of other
accounting issues by its main regulator, the Office of Federal Housing
Enterprise Oversight; and class-action lawsuits by investors. In
addition, Fannie's board has hired outside lawyers to investigate the
regulators' allegations.
</P>
<P>
The government-sponsored company has been on the defensive since
September, when OFHEO alleged that Fannie had systematically
manipulated accounting estimates, ignored accounting requirements it
had lobbied unsuccessfully against and operated with weak internal
controls that helped obscure the other problems. The report said that
Fannie Mae delayed booking $200 million of expenses in 1998, which
allowed Raines and other top executives to receive millions of dollars
in bonuses linked to Fannie's profit.
</P>
<P>
A source with knowledge of the board's deliberations in recent days
described a sometimes painful debate. Raines, the source said, at
times argued passionately that he had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
Raines, 55, is one of the most prominent African Americans in
corporate America. He rose from a family that supplemented work with
welfare to become a Rhodes scholar, president of the Harvard
University Board of Overseers, director of the Office of Management
and Budget under President Bill Clinton and a leader of the Washington
business community. His compensation last year, including $3 million
in stock options, totaled about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
Fannie's federal regulator, however, demanded management changes,
holding Raines responsible for a corporate culture that emphasized
stable earnings at the expense of accurate financial disclosures.
Sources said the regulator was determined to initiate a public
proceeding to remove Raines if the board did not act.
</P>
<P>
The costs of an all-out fight with a federal regulator would be too
great, Fannie's board ultimately concluded, so Raines was told he
would have to go.
</P>
<P>
The board had decided by Monday evening to accept Howard's
resignation. But its announcement was held up, as directors continued
to discuss different scenarios in which Raines would remain chief
executive, including the appointment of an independent chairman.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Raines said: ``I previously stated that I would
hold myself accountable if the SEC determined that significant
mistakes were made in the Company's accounting. Although, to my
knowledge, the Company has always made good faith efforts to get its
accounting right, the SEC has determined that mistakes were made. By
my early retirement, I have held myself accountable.''
</P>
<P>
Ann McLaughlin Korologos, the presiding non-management director,
thanked Raines and Howard for their ``many contributions'' and said
the board ``takes these steps today to move the company forward.'' The
company also announced that the board's audit committee has dismissed
KPMG LLP, the outside accounting firm that audited the financial
statements Fannie will now correct.
</P>
<P>
Armando Falcon Jr., head of OFHEO, commended the board's action and
said, ``We are encouraged that the Board's announcement signals a new
culture and a new direction for Fannie Mae.''
</P>
<P>
The upheaval at Fannie Mae comes a year after similar problems at
its smaller rival, McLean, Va.-based Freddie Mac, forced out two
Freddie chief executives in rapid succession.
</P>
<P>
The company announced that board member Stephen Ashley, a former
president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, will become
non-executive chairman. Daniel Mudd, the company's vice chairman and
chief operating officer, will serve as interim chief executive. And
Robert Levin, executive vice president, will serve as interim chief
financial officer while the company seeks permanent replacements.
</P>
<P>
Though it was not apparent at the time, Raines's downfall began in
early 2003, when Freddie Mac disclosed that it had made billions of
dollars of accounting errors. Ensuing investigations revealed that
Freddie Mac executives had gone to elaborate lengths to make its
earnings growth appear smooth.
</P>
<P>
Given the similar nature of two companies, OFHEO decided to take a
closer look at Fannie Mae's accounting. As that review got underway,
Raines complained that Fannie was being unfairly tainted by its
competitors' troubles, and he denied that Fannie had similar problems.
</P>
<P>
In its September report, OFHEO alleged that since a key accounting
rule took effect in 2001, Fannie improperly excluded from earnings
changes in the value of derivatives, complex financial instruments
that can be used to speculate for profit or hedge against risk.
Freddie Mac violated the same rule.
</P>
<P>
Howard, 56, who joined Fannie Mae in 1982 and served as chief
financial officer since 1990, oversaw Fannie's accounting.
</P>
<P>
At a congressional hearing in October, Raines pointed to the SEC as
the authority on accounting matters and pinned his hopes on a
favorable decision from the agency. Last week, the SEC's top
accountant sided with OFHEO on questions of accounting policy, saying
that instead of following the requirements, ``Fannie Mae internally
developed its own unique methodology.''
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, the scandal at Fannie Mae has reinvigorated
efforts to create a more powerful regulator for Fannie and Freddie.
Members of Congress and the Bush administration generally agree that
the companies' primary regulator, OFHEO, is ill-equipped to oversee
huge, complex institutions that could send shock waves through the
economy and financial system if they ever foundered.
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae, for example, has debts to bondholders of $957 billion,
equal to about a fifth of the publicly held portion of the U.S.
national debt. In addition, the company guarantees principal and
interest payments on $1.9 trillion of mortgage-backed securities.
</P>
<P>
Raines' successor must add billions of dollars to Fannie's
reserves, which will be below the company's regulatory minimum when it
records the additional losses.
</P>
<P>
When he became chief executive in 1999, Raines committed Fannie to
achieving double-digit earnings growth for five consecutive years, and
he set a goal of doubling earnings over that period. The company
achieved the goals, but the corrected accounting could change the
picture dramatically, and the need to increase Fannie's reserves will
make it harder for the company to grow in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Established in the 1930s as the country was emerging from the Great
Depression, Fannie borrows money by issuing bonds and uses that money
to buy mortgages from lenders, thereby giving the lenders cash to
issue more loans. Fannie also packages mortgages into securities that
are sold to investors, along with the company's guarantee that it will
pay investors the principal and interest on the loans if the borrowers
default.
</P>
<P>
Some corporate governance specialists were stunned by allegations
that Fannie engaged in accounting manipulations years after the
watershed scandals at Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. Those debacles
inspired tough new legal penalties for accounting manipulations,
served a warning to corporate bosses and seemed to bring about a
change in the culture of America's boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of Enron's collapse, Raines became a spokesman for
the cause of good corporate governance. On behalf of the Business
Roundtable, a group of chief executives of many of the nation's
largest corporations, Raines led a task force that prescribed best
practices for corporate leaders, and he publicly criticized executives
who disclaimed responsibility for wrongdoing within their
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Raines and Fannie Mae ``have been so arrogant, not just to
shareholders but so arrogant in Washington, that it's kind of a
well-deserved comeuppance,'' said Sarah Teslik, former head of the
Council of Institutional Investors.
</P>
<P>
But Arne Christenson, a former Fannie Mae executive who was before
that a top aide to then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, said
Raines will be difficult to replace. ``The thing about Frank is, he
had a blend of business acumen and political savvy that was uniquely
helpful to Fannie Mae,'' Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
``I'm sure he (Raines) would have preferred to have stayed, but
things are the way they are,'' said attorney R. Timothy Columbus, a
close friend of Raines. ``He did what he had to do.''

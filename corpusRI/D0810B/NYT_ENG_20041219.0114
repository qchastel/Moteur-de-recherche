FANNIE MAE DIRECTORS MEET BUT TAKE NO STAND ON TOP EXECUTIVES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
The directors of Fannie Mae concluded a special meeting on Sunday
without announcing whether they would support or replace the
company's senior management, including its chairman and chief
executive, Franklin D. Raines, and its chief financial officer, J.
Timothy Howard.
</P>
<P>
Both executives certified financial statements that the Securities
and Exchange Commission have ordered revised because of violations of
accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
The directors have met several times to discuss management and
capital issue since the commission's decision on Wednesday that the
company had violated accounting standards and must restate its
earnings for the past three-and-a-half years and must raise its
capital level. The company said previously that any requirement that
it restate its earnings could lead it to declare about $9 billion in
losses, wiping out more than a third of its earnings over the period.
</P>
<P>
The senior management of Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest buyer of
mortgages, has come under increasing political and regulatory
pressure after withering criticism from its main regulator, the
Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.
</P>
<P>
That agency concluded in September that company executives had
manipulated expenses to smooth earnings and meet projected financial
targets that would permit the executives to win maximum bonuses. In a
letter on Sept. 20, Armando Falcon Jr., the director of the oversight
office, told Fannie Mae directors that the agency had found
significant evidence that raised "doubts concerning the validity of
previously reported financial results, the adequacy of regulatory
capital, the quality of management supervision and the overall safety
and soundness of the enterprise."
</P>
<P>
Raines has denied that the expenses were manipulated for such
purposes. The SEC and the Justice Department continue to examine
those issues.
</P>
<P>
In testimony before Congress two months ago, Raines suggested that
the oversight office was embarking on a witch hunt and had improperly
prepared and issued its report. He predicted that he and Fannie Mae
would be vindicated by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
Raines' counterattack initially relieved some pressure on Fannie Mae
and its senior management. But the agency suffered a major setback on
Wednesday when the SEC's chief accountant said that the company had
violated accounting rules on its treatment of investments in
derivatives and in the way it accounted for losses from prepaid
loans.

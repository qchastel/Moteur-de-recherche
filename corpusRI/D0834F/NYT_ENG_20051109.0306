A CITY'S VOTERS WEARY OF THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN SPOTLIGHT Terry Aguayo
and Gary Gately contributed reporting for this article. DOVER, Pa.
-- In the end, voters in Dover said they were
tired of being portrayed as a northern version of Dayton,
Tenn., a Bible Belt hamlet where 80 years ago a
biology teacher named John Scopes was tried for illegally teaching
evolution.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the residents of Dover ousted all eight school board
members running for re-election who had put their town in
a global spotlight -- and their school district on trial
-- for being the first in the nation to introduce
intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in science class.
In swept the full Dover CARES slate of eight candidates,
which had coalesced to oppose the change in the science
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
"I think the people of Dover are tired of the attention
over such a miniscule thing, and they want a change,"
said Lonny Langione, who had served on the school board
in years past and supported the challengers. "A lot of
the people I talked to were upset because the school
board came to using taxpayer money to advance their own
agenda."
</P>
<P>
Before it took up intelligent design, Dover was a typical American
town experiencing typical American growing pains: family farmers selling out
to developers, fields sprouting McMansions, overcrowded classrooms, SUVs speeding down
roads built for tractors.
</P>
<P>
By wading into the great reawakening of a national debate over
the teaching of evolution, the town of Dover was diverted
from bread-and-butter issues, and found itself divided in surprising ways.
</P>
<P>
The lines were not neatly drawn. Christians who belonged to the
same church found themselves on opposite sides. Fathers quarreled with
sons. Next-door neighbors posted dueling lawn signs. Registered Republicans cast
their party affiliations aside to run with the victorious Dover
CARES slate when election rules forced all eight of its
candidates to run on the Democratic line.
</P>
<P>
Voters themselves crossed party lines to vote for the candidates they
favored. If they had not, the school board incumbents, all
of whom ran on the Republican line, probably would have
prevailed in a district where 70 percent of voters are
registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
"It really did pit neighbor against neighbor," said Connie LaCoe, an
elementary school teacher who has lived in the community for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the election was close. Only 26 votes separated
the winner of one seat from his rival.
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that we won all eight seats," said the Rev.
Warren Eshbach, the spokesman for Dover CARES, whose son, Robert,
was among the winning candidates. "It shows what good bipartisanship
can do."
</P>
<P>
The election came only four days after closing arguments in a
six-week trial of the Dover school board and administrators in
U.S. District Court in Harrisburg, about 25 miles to the
northeast. Eleven parents had sued the Dover board on constitutional
grounds, claiming that intelligent design was an outgrowth of religious
creationism. The case will be decided by Judge John E.
Jones III, who said he expected to rule by early
January.
</P>
<P>
The majority of voters rejected the school board's argument that they
were only trying to expose students to a variety of
theories about the development of living organisms. The policy did
not actually tell teachers to teach intelligent design, just to
mention it in a four-paragraph statement to be read to
students.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that evolution is "not a fact" and that
students could explore intelligent design by reading "Of Pandas and
People" in the school library.
</P>
<P>
The debate over Darwin versus intelligent design has played out in
places like Myers Barbershop, where the owner, Barry Myers, has
been trimming the townspeople's hair for 37 years.
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think we got here by some big bang,"
said Myers, who said he voted for the incumbents. "I
think if they have the right people to teach it,
it should be taught."
</P>
<P>
Teaching intelligent design, he said, would help bring a "moral compass"
to the classroom. But his son, Matt Myers, 34, who
also works in his father's barbershop, voiced a decidedly different
view.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad the board's been voted out," he said. "I don't
think science teachers are qualified to teach intelligent design."
</P>
<P>
He said that intelligent design should be offered as an elective,
a position advocated by several Dover CARES candidates.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was hard-fought and at times nasty. Dover school board
members sent out a mass mailing accusing the Dover CARES
slate of allying with the American Civil Liberties Union --
a group, it said in the mailing, that had also
defended terrorists and the North American Man/Boy Love Association. The
ACLU is representing the plaintiffs against the Dover board.
</P>
<P>
"That's the level they were willing to sink to," said Bryan
Rehm, who ran with the Dover CARES slate and was
also a plaintiff in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
The case will not be affected by the election in the
short term, lawyers involved in it said. The judge must
still issue a ruling on the intelligent design policy as
it stands. However, the new school board, which takes office
in early December, could decide to revoke the current policy.
</P>
<P>
Many Dover residents, like Lisa Vilkas, simply want the entire controversy
to disappear.
</P>
<P>
"I just can't wait until it just fizzles," said Vilkas as
she sat in a van outside the high school on
Wednesday, waiting for two of her daughters.

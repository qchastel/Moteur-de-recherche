Major US science group opposes "intelligent design" doctrine

<P>
The largest US science 
society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science 
(AAAS), urged a Pennsylvania federal court Friday to prohibit an 
anti-evolution doctrine known as "intelligent design" in biology 
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
The organization and the US National Center for Science 
Education issued a statement, supporting students' parents to sue 
the Dover school district, Pennsylvania, against its decision to 
include " intelligent design," which says life has a God-like 
creator, in the curriculum of ninth-grade biology classes.
</P>
<P>
The school district requires teachers to read a disclaimer 
prior to a unit on evolution. The disclaimer says that 
"intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that 
differs from Darwin's view." It also notes that a reference book 
on intelligent design is available to students.
</P>
<P>
The parents and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said 
this policy violates the constitutional separation of church and 
state, which forbids teaching religion in public schools.
</P>
<P>
They also argued that intelligent design is unscientific and 
has no place in a science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
"The Dover disclaimer brings religion straight into the science
classroom," said Alan Leshner, chief executive officer for the 
AAAS.
</P>
<P>
It misrepresents the state of knowledge about evolution, he 
said, and implies that a religious belief has a science base. And 
by referring students to a non-science text, the disclaimer 
"surely will confuse them about what is and is not science."
</P>
<P>
"Intelligent design" holds that nature is so complex it must 
have been the work of an God-like creator rather than the result 
of natural selection, as argued by Charles Darwin in his 1859 
Theory of Evolution.
</P>
<P>
The Dover school district said there are "gaps" in evolution, 
which it emphasizes is a theory rather than established fact, and 
that students have a right to consider other views on the origins 
of life.
</P>
<P>
It also argued that it does not teach intelligent design 
directly but simply makes students aware of its existence as an 
alternative to evolution. It denied intelligent design is 
"religion in disguise", saying it is a scientific theory.
</P>
<P>
Under the influence of conservative religious groups, 
educational boards of several states have allowed, or will allow  
the "intelligent design" doctrine to be taught in basic schools as
a rival to the evolution theory.
</P>
<P>
The Pennsylvanian lawsuit, which is set to begin in a federal 
court on Sept. 26, will become a crucial sign in a new battle 
against the "intelligent design" movement, according to Eugenie 
Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science 
Education.
</P>
<P>
"If the parents win the upcoming case, it will definitely throw
sand in the gears of the 'intelligent design' movement," Scott 
said.

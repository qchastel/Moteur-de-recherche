WAR OF IDEAS FOUGHT IN A SMALL-TOWN COURTROOM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HARRISBURG, Pa.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Route 74 is the main road into
and out of Dover borough, a tidy hamlet of 1,800
set in rolling, wooded hills that at this time of
year are dressed in the reds and golds of autumn.
</P>
<P>
It was here, in October 2004, that a school board led
by fundamentalist Christians included so-called intelligent design in its biology
curriculum, launching the latest federal courtroom battle over the place
of religion in the classroom, a warfare of ideas that
has roiled America's political waters ever since the Scopes "monkey
trial" of 1925, and beyond -- way back to the
adoption of the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Dover Township -- a larger incorporated area of about
20,000 -- will elect a new school board.
</P>
<P>
At the northern edge of town on Route 74 stands a
billboard that represents the differing positions over science and religion,
ideology and theology, that have riven Dover. On the north
side of the billboard is an appeal from the incumbent
board:
</P>
<P>
"TAXPAYERS. Your School Board Puts Dover Independent of ACLU. VOTE REPUBLICAN."
On the other side is an appeal from the opposing
camp, Dover Cares: "Quality Education," it proclaims. "Common Sense. Common
Cause."
</P>
<P>
At the trial, which ended Friday after six weeks of testimony,
one plaintiff, Julie Smith, told of her daughter coming home
from school and saying to her: "Mom, evolution is a
lie. What kind of Christian are you?"
</P>
<P>
Bryan Rehm, a Dover Cares candidate and one of the 11
parents who have sued the board, said simply: "This community
is ready for healing."
</P>
<P>
Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District was the first legal test
for intelligent design. At issue, is whether the policy of
the board to incorporate intelligent design into its curriculum was
motivated by religious or educational principles. If either the purpose,
or the effect, of a public school policy is religious,
it would violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment,
which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mandate a separation
of church and state.
</P>
<P>
The last time the Supreme Court was asked to decide a
similar issue was 1987, when Louisiana schools were requiring creationism
to be taught alongside Darwinism. In Edwards vs. Aguillard, the
court struck that state law.
</P>
<P>
Intelligent design supporters maintain that Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection,
which underpins the position that man is descended from apes,
cannot fully explain the origin of complex forms of life;
thus, a higher intelligence must have designed them. Opponents of
intelligent design say the theory is a means to introduce
religion into the classroom and lacks scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
The trial, held in Harrisburg, about 20 miles north of Dover,
in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge John E. Jones
III, was the first time a court has been asked
to decide whether intelligent design can be taught in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
Many consider it the most important challenge to evolutionary science in
many years. It attracted international media attention. Paramount Pictures sent
a representative to the courtroom. The New Yorker magazine staffed
it, as did Harper's Magazine, whose story is being written
by Matthew Chapman, who happens to be the great-great-grandson of
Charles Darwin.
</P>
<P>
At issue was a four-paragraph statement adopted by the Dover school
board, which was read to ninth-grade biology students as they
begin to study the theory of evolution and which says:
</P>
<P>
"Because Darwin's Theory is a theory, it continues to be tested
... The Theory is not a fact. Gaps exist in
the Theory for which there is no evidence ... Intelligent
Design is an explanation of the origin of life that
differs from Darwin's view ... Students are encouraged to keep
an open mind."
</P>
<P>
The Dover board is defended by the Thomas More Law Center
of Michigan, a nonprofit firm founded by two conservative Roman
Catholics, whose Web site states: "Our purpose is to be
the sword and shield for people of faith ... to
defend and protect Christians and their religious beliefs in the
public square."
</P>
<P>
Intelligent design is science, defendants say, because the "irreducible complexity" of
some aspects of the natural world cannot be accounted for
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs, whose attorneys include Witold J. Walczak, of the American
Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, argued that intelligent design is
creationism in pseudoscientific garb. They pointed to what has become
known as the "wedge document," a memo prepared by the
Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based think tank that has been at
the forefront of attacking Darwinism for promoting atheism and destroying
cultural and moral values.
</P>
<P>
The "wedge document" appeared on the Web in 1999, and promises
to stifle scientific materialism, replacing it with "a science consonant
with Christian and theistic convictions." Intelligent design, the memo said,
"will function as a wedge" in that struggle.
</P>
<P>
In court, the plaintiffs quoted from two versions of a textbook,
"Of Pandas and People." One version predates the Supreme Court's
1987 decision in the Louisiana creationism case; the other came
after that landmark ruling and is now available in Dover
school libraries.
</P>
<P>
The pre-1987 text said: "Creation means that various forms of life
began abruptly through the agency of an intelligent creator, with
their distinctive features already intact -- fish with fins, birds
with feathers, beaks and wings, etc."
</P>
<P>
The newer edition states: "Intelligent design means that various forms of
life began abruptly though an intelligent agent ... ."
</P>
<P>
"When we talk about an intelligent designer," argued plaintiffs' attorney Eric
J. Rothschild, "with the ability to design and create and
build biological life, we are talking about God. ... Science
has no way of proving or measuring supernatural or divine
action."
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that Judge Jones' decision will have far-reaching implications.
"This is the World Series and Oscars and Nobel Prize
of the evolution biz all wrapped into one," said Eugenie
Scott, the executive director of the Oakland-based National Center for
Science Education, who travels the country defending evolution and who
played a crucial role in assembling what she calls "a
dream team" of expert witnesses for the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
"The results will be extremely significant for American public schools," Scott
said. "If the judge rules for the district, I think
this will give a green light to school districts across
the country that would like to introduce some form of
creationism in the classroom."
</P>
<P>
In a November Gallup poll, only 35 percent of those polled
"believed confidently" that Darwin's theory was "supported by the evidence,"
whereas 45 percent believed that "God created man in his
present form."
</P>
<P>
Richard Thompson, president of the Thomas More Law Center and chief
counsel for the Dover board, agrees with Scott. "Intelligent design
is now being adopted by a number of credible scientists,"
he said. "If the Dover school district wins this case,
you're going to see intelligent design popping up on school
board agendas all over the country."
</P>
<P>
The lead scientific witness for the board was Dr. Michael Behe,
a biochemistry professor at Lehigh University and author of "Darwin's
Black Box," who testified that "the appearance of design in
aspects of biology is overwhelming. Intelligent design is based on
observed, empirical, physical evidence from nature."
</P>
<P>
Behe asserted, as an example, that "scientific literature has no answers
to the question of the origin of the immune system."
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination, the professor -- whose science faculty colleagues at Lehigh
University have issued a statement supporting evolutionary theory as established
science -- was surrounded by stacks of biology and medical
texts and peer-reviewed journals piled there by plaintiffs' attorney Rothschild,
who pointed out that all the writings discussed the evolution
of the immune system. But in his three days of
testimony, Behe did not budge.
</P>
<P>
A second defense witness, Dr. Scott Minnich, a microbiologist at the
University of Idaho, testified that "intelligent design is a good
paradigm, consistent with the empirical evidence." But, he complained: "It's
almost like you're a heretic," if you hold such views.
Intelligent design has been repudiated by the American Association for
the Advancement of Science and the National Academy of Sciences,
the two leading professional organizations in the field.
</P>
<P>
Minnich acknowledged that the "intelligent agent is the God of Christianity,"
but insisted that he didn't "mix religion with science."
</P>
<P>
He offered as an example of intelligent design bacterial flagellum, which
he described as "a true rotary motor," with a propeller,
a universal joint, rings and a drive shaft. Because the
flagellum cannot function without all its parts, he argued, random
selection cannot account for its creation. Because of its "irreducible
complexity," it is "the system that will make or break
intelligent design," he said.
</P>
<P>
The chief scientific witness for the plaintiffs, Kenneth Miller, said that
he, too, was "a person of faith. ... I'm a
Roman Catholic." He is also a Brown University biologist and
co-author of one of the most widely used high school
textbooks --"Biology," which is the primary text employed in Dover
Senior High School. Miller testified that, "If you invoke a
non-natural cause, a spirit force or something like that in
your research, I have no way to test it. So
even if you are correct ... that really wouldn't be
a part of science."
</P>
<P>
"The statement by the Dover board of education falsely undermines the
scientific status of the theory of evolution," he said, "and
does a great disservice to science education in Dover."
</P>
<P>
The Dover school district's science teachers, who opposed including intelligent design
in the curriculum, refused to read the statement, which had
to be read instead by an administrator. The original version
contained a sentence suggested by the teachers: "Darwin's theory of
evolution is the dominant scientific explanation of the origin of
species." But the school board edited that out.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most anticipated witness at the trial was William Buckingham,
who as the chairman of the Dover district curriculum committee
last fall, had spearheaded the adoption of the intelligent design
statement. It was Buckingham, a former prison supervisor and member
of an independent fundamentalist church, who cried out at a
board meeting: "Two thousand years ago somebody died on a
cross. Can't someone take a stand for him?"
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination, Buckingham acknowledged there were times his testimony contradicted statements
he had made earlier in sworn depositions, but said his
memory was faulty because he was "addicted to OxyContin," a
prescription opiate, and had twice been in rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Both Buckingham and the former school board president, Alan Bonsell, who
were the leading advocates for the change, acknowledged in testimony
that they believe the book of Genesis is literally true.
</P>
<P>
This week, Bonsell acknowledged that he had earlier testified untruthfully when
he claimed not to know where money was raised to
donate 60 copies of "Of Pandas and People" to the
school library. The money had been raised in Buckingham's church
and funneled through Bonsell's father, so the books could be
donated anonymously. Hearing that, the usually affable Judge Jones lost
patience.
</P>
<P>
Red-faced and visibly angry, he took over examining Bonsell himself, peppering
him with questions for 10 minutes. "You tell me why
you didn't say Mr. Buckingham was involved," he demanded. Then,
later in the week, he snapped at one of the
board's lawyers: "Don't insult my intelligence."
</P>
<P>
Both sides were exquisitely attuned to Jones' moods and interests, because
they had agreed to a bench trial -- a trial
without a jury -- which is common in First Amendment
cases where the arguments are mostly about legal rather than
factual issues.
</P>
<P>
"Thank God" it's a bench trial, said the National Center for
Science Education's Scott, who joked she's called an atheist so
often she thinks it's her first name -- Atheist Eugenie
Scott. "There's no way on God's green earth we'd get
the verdict we want from a jury."
</P>
<P>
The judge was appointed to the bench by President Bush. He
had been a fundraiser for both Bush presidents, and served
former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge in a number of capacities.
The Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, which collects anonymous quotes
from lawyers about judges, describes him as able, and balanced
between plaintiffs and defendants.
</P>
<P>
One lawyer had this to say: "He is willing to give
due consideration to new and different approaches. That is refreshing.
He is willing to do the intellectually challenging work. He
is a proactive judge."
</P>
<P>
And a witty one. There had been testimony that some creationists
believe the Earth was created in seven days, as described
in Genesis, with geological formations such as the Grand Canyon
resulting from the flood described in the story of Noah
and his arc. The Earth, they believe, is no more
than 10,000 years old, whereas the accepted scientific view places
its age at 4.5 billion years, "give or take a
year," as one of the plaintiffs' lawyers remarked.
</P>
<P>
When, on the final day of the trial, one lawyer pointed
out that, "this is the 40th day of the trial,
and tonight will be the 40th night," Jones replied:
</P>
<P>
"That's an interesting coincidence. But it was not by design."
</P>
<P>
Jones said it was his "strong desire to get the case
decided this year." He may issue a narrow opinion limited
to the specific facts of the Dover case. Or he
may make a broader ruling on the constitutionality of teaching
intelligent design in public school classrooms.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how he rules, this trial was the beginning of
what will be a protracted battle in the courts sought
by Christian conservatives such as defense lawyer Thompson.
</P>
<P>
"We're preparing our case for an ultimate review by the Supreme
Court of the United States," Thompson said. He added that
President Bush's nomination of Samuel Alito to fill a vacant
seat on the high court is "absolutely" encouraging. Senators of
both parties who have been meeting with Alito reported he
told them he believed the court might have gone too
far in separating church and state.
</P>
<P>
On the night the trial ended, Theatre Harrisburg opened a new
production of "Inherit the Wind," about the Scopes trial, in
which Clarence Darrow, arguing for a science teacher who taught
evolution in defiance of state law, was defeated by William
Jennings Bryan. That timing, too, was a coincidence.

Intelligent Design Battle Evolves

<P>
The hard-fought school election was over, and there
was hope that the scars from a nationally watched battle between
evolution and intelligent design in public schools would begin to heal
at Monday's meeting of the Dover school board.
</P>
<P>
But bitterness persisted over last week's results, in which eight
candidates opposed to the teaching of intelligent design in this rural
community narrowly defeated eight incumbents, who had included it as
part of the science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
The clash took place as a federal lawsuit over the board's decision
last year was being argued in a court in Harrisburg, north of Dover. A
decision in the case, which pitted the theory of evolution against a
rival belief about the origins of life, is expected next month.
</P>
<P>
``Intelligent design isn't finished here, it isn't finished
anywhere,'' said Alan Bonsell, an outgoing board member, as he left
Monday's meeting, his last. Several hundred people, who filled a
school cafeteria, applauded politely when he said the board had
``worked hard'' to bring Dover students ``a much better future.''
</P>
<P>
The eight victors, who sat in a group, had a different message:
Bernadette Reinking, a newly elected board member, said in an
interview that ``Dover needs to heal and put the divisions behind it,
because we have to get back to our lives. We have to let the
bitterness die down from this battle and focus on our students.''
</P>
<P>
She added, however, that ``nobody ever believed this board should
have tried to impose its beliefs on people. And we're certainly not
going to do that now.'' The new board, she said, was likely to
consider teaching intelligent design in a social studies or philosophy
class -- but not as part of the curriculum in ninth-grade biology.
</P>
<P>
The issue surfaced last year, when the former board voted that a
one-minute statement about intelligent design should be read in
biology classes at Dover High School. It marked the first time a
school board had mandated teaching this belief in a science course.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of intelligent design believe organisms are too complex
to have developed by chance, and that there must have been a
``designer'' who created life. Some believe the designer is God,
although intelligent design makes no reference to this.
</P>
<P>
Under the theory of evolution, which is widely taught in public
schools, life evolved through a process of natural selection and
random mutations. The theory makes no statement one way or another on
the issue of a supernatural agent or divine purpose.
</P>
<P>
After the board acted, 11 parents sued the Dover Area School
District to block the policy, saying intelligent design was a thinly
disguised version of ``creationism,'' a Bible-based belief about the
origins of life. They contended that teaching intelligent design in
science classes would violate the constitutional separation of church
and state.
</P>
<P>
The defendants argued that they placed intelligent design in the
ninth-grade science curriculum to give students exposure to a variety
of viewpoints. A final decision in the non-jury case will be made by
U.S. Judge John E. Jones III.
</P>
<P>
As the trial began in October, the conflict was heating up in the
political arena. Rival slates of candidates were formed over the issue
and lawn signs appeared throughout the community; debates in local
churches sometimes grew intense. On election day, partisans on both
sides worked furiously to turn out supporters.
</P>
<P>
Eight seats were at stake; the term of a ninth board member had not
expired and was not up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
``It was a tough political struggle from the beginning,'' Bonsell
said. ``And everybody had their eye on the lawsuit. It kind of drowned
out a lot of other news.''
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil Liberties
Union, and a victory could force the Dover school board to pay hefty
legal fees. Fearing such an outcome, one outgoing board member urged
his colleagues Monday night to abandon the intelligent design policy,
especially in view of the election.
</P>
<P>
His motion died for lack of a second.
</P>
<P>
``I am compelled to make this proposal on behalf of the voters, who
have spoken,'' said David Napierskie. ``While I believe in intelligent
design, it is clearly in the best interests of our community to move
forward. ...There is sufficient reason to revoke this policy and to
try and dismiss the case. The original lawsuit has become
meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
Both sides seemed weary from the political struggle. In last week's
election, the eight victorious Democratic candidates got 21,265 votes;
the losing Republican side polled 20,197 votes. The outcome was
notable in a community where 70 percent of the voters are Republicans;
the area voted for President Bush by a 3-to-1 margin.

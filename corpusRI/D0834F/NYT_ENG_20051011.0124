NOW ARGUING NEAR YOU: THE EVOLUTION DRAMA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Harrisburg, Pa., lawyers are in court on Wednesday arguing whether
intelligent design should be taught in biology class alongside evolution.
As Richard Thompson, the lawyer representing the school board members
who favor teaching intelligent design, said, "There are two worldviews
that are in conflict."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, in Arcata, Calif., in another trial involving evolution's
place in the school curriculum, a lawyer told a jury,
"The contest between evolution and Christianity is a duel to
the death, between the unbelief that attempts to speak through
so-called science, and the defenders of the Christian faith."
</P>
<P>
The difference is that the Pennsylvania trial, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area
School District, is real, while the one taking place on
the other side of the country is a play performed
by L.A. Theater Works and drawn from the transcripts of
the famed Scopes "monkey trial" of 1925, when a high
school teacher in Tennessee was indicted for teaching evolution.
</P>
<P>
Observing the 80th anniversary of the Scopes trial, Theater Works began
its 23-city tour of Peter Goodchild's radio play "The Great
Tennessee Monkey Trial" on Tuesday night with a rotating cast
of actors that includes Edward Asner, Michael Learned, John de
Lancie and Tom Bosley. Many places where the play, directed
by Gordon Hunt, will be performed -- mainly college campuses
-- are sponsoring additional events like panel discussions and workshops
with the actors.
</P>
<P>
Susan Albert Loewenberg, the producing director of L.A. Theater Works, said
recently: "This is not agitprop theater. Hopefully, this docudrama will
enable people to think about the issue. The presentation will
help to create a useful national conversation." But she emphasized
that the theater company is not promoting either side of
the argument.
</P>
<P>
After this week's performances at Humboldt State University, the company will
make stops in Nashville, Tenn.; Green Bay, Wis.; Purchase, N.Y.;
and other cities before finishing the tour in Los Angeles
in March.
</P>
<P>
"I think the timing is great because it's something that's in
controversy right now," said Roy Furshpan, the director of Center
Arts, which is sponsoring this week's performances at Humboldt State.
Furshpan was not expecting much contention over the performance. "Arcata
is a fairly liberal town," he said.
</P>
<P>
But in Tennessee, home of the Scopes trial, the issue is
white-hot, said Bridgette Kohnhorst, assistant director of performing and fine
arts at Vanderbilt University, where the show and forum are
scheduled for Oct. 19. Kohnhorst said she had been working
on the project long before the Dover School Board voted
to include intelligent design in the science curriculum. The timing,
though, is serendipitous, she said, adding, "You begin conversations about
something like this a whole year earlier, and then what
could be better?"
</P>
<P>
Loewenberg originally commissioned Goodchild, a writer and producer at the British
Broadcasting Corp., in 1992 to work on an adaptation of
the Scopes trial transcripts. ("Inherit the Wind," the 1955 play
and the 1960 film with Spencer Tracy and Fredric March,
was based on the trial.) The company recorded the show,
with Asner as William Jennings Bryan facing off against Charles
Durning as Clarence Darrow.
</P>
<P>
L.A. Theater Works began producing recorded plays in 1987, with a
14-hour recording of the Sinclair Lewis novel "Babbitt." Now the
company has created a library of more than 360 titles
-- the largest collection of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
The recordings are used in an educational outreach program, "Alive and
Aloud," which supplies free radio plays and teaching materials to
2,000 schools. "The Play's the Thing," a weekly two-hour radio
show broadcast on public radio affiliates across the country, features
plays, interviews and other programs. In addition, L.A. Theater Works
has an annual season of 10 or more plays at
the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, where each play
is recorded five times in front of a live audience
and then edited to create a definitive CD version.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, when Loewenberg was thinking about whether to do
a show on tour, she reviewed the results of a
recent company survey of teachers. "Surprisingly, we found that Scopes
was the most utilized of all the recordings," she said,
adding, "and we were already aware of the growing controversy
surrounding the teaching of evolution."
</P>
<P>
The show has traveled before. When the Kansas State Board of
Education decided to remove evolution from the science curriculum in
1999, Loewenberg received a phone call from the television producer
Norman Lear. "He said, 'If I arrange it and pay
for it, will you take the Scopes show to Kansas?"'
Lear's advocacy group, People for the American Way, set up
a performance the following summer at the Lied Center at
the University of Kansas and ran a spirited panel discussion
as well, Loewenberg said.
</P>
<P>
Asner, a Kansas native who was in that show, is one
of several actors who has been with the company since
its beginning. As part of the current tour's revolving cast,
he is returning a third time to play Bryan, the
prosecuting attorney, for the first several stops. Since Asner, like
the other actors, is working for union-scale wages, it is
not a particularly lucrative venture. But, he said, "I love
doing radio; it's a very gratifying experience." He added, "It's
a phenomenal exercise, like trying to get a tune out
of a Schoenberg piece."
</P>
<P>
In each city on the tour, Loewenberg said, the local National
Public Radio affiliate will record and broadcast the production, along
with any discussions, to "extend the conversation."
</P>
<P>
Loewenberg might be interested to find herself in agreement with Bryan,
who said at the 1925 trial, "There can be no
settlement of a great cause without discussion, and people will
not discuss a cause until their attention is drawn to
it."

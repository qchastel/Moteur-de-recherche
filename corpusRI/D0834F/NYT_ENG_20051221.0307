SCHOOLS AROUND THE U.S. PONDER EVOLUTION RULING
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the school board in Muscatine, Iowa, sits down next year
for its twice-a-decade evaluation of the district's science curriculum, the
matter of whether to teach intelligent design as a challenge
to evolution is expected to come up for discussion.
</P>
<P>
But board members disagree about whether they will be swayed by
a sweeping court decision on intelligent design released Tuesday in
Pennsylvania. A federal judge there declared intelligent design to be
"a religious alternative masquerading as a scientific theory" that must
not be taught in a public school science class.

"I don't think that a judge in one state is going
to be able to tell everybody in all other states
what to do," said Paul Brooks, a school board member
in Muscatine who favors teaching intelligent design. The board's vice
president, Ann Hart, demurred. "This determination in Pennsylvania will help
the cause," Hart said, "for those of us who think
intelligent design should not be taught in public school science
classes because of separation of church and state."
</P>
<P>
Educators and legislators in Muscatine and other communities that are considering
intelligent design said they were still just learning about the
results of the landmark trial involving the school board in
Dover, Pa., and had not read the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
The federal district judge in the Pennsylvania case, John E. Jones
III, ruled after a six-week trial that intelligent design was
"an interesting theological argument, but it is not science." He
concluded that it was "unconstitutional to teach ID as an
alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom."
</P>
<P>
The judge's 139-page decision dealt not only with the specific missteps
of the Dover school board, but traced the growth of
the intelligent design movement from the remnants of creationism and
creation science -- which the Supreme Court declared in 1987
to be unconstitutional to teach in public school science class.

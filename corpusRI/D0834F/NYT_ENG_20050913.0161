'INTELLIGENT DESIGN' FACES FIRST COURT TEST 750&amp;add.

?WASHINGTON - A rule instructing high school?biology teachers to tell students
that "intelligent design" is a viable scientific alternative to evolution
faces its first challenge in a federal court this month.
</P>
<P>
?The suit was brought by a 11 parents in the Pennsylvania
town of Dover who charge the school board is attempting
to promote a religion - Christianity - in violation of
the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
?The suit has made Dover, a town 100 miles west of
Philadelphia with five elementary schools, one intermediate school and one
high school, the first battleground in a national struggle over
whether alternatives to evolution should be forced into high-school texts.
</P>
<P>
?Intelligent design holds that the development of life on Earth cannot
be explained solely on the basis of chemical or biological
facts, and instead appears to have been guided a supreme
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
?The town's school board last October passed a resolution requiring that
students in a 9th grade biology course be told that
evolution "is a theory, not a fact" and that "intelligent
design is an explanation of the origin of life that
differs" from evolution.
</P>
<P>
?They students were also invited to read a book, "Of Pandas
and People," in the school library.
</P>
<P>
?The book is published by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics,
a Richardson, Texas, nonprofit organization that describes it as a
"supplemental biology text for high school students." The book presents
intelligent design as a scientific theory.
</P>
<P>
Even President Bush weighed in on the national debate, telling Texas
newspaper reporters last month that he thought "both sides ought
to be taught ... so?people can understand what the debate
is about."
</P>
<P>
?Many scientists call the concept of intelligent design non-scientific.
</P>
<P>
?American Civil Liberties Union lawyers representing the plaintiffs have sought to
depict the Dover matter as part of a national effort
to install intelligent design in classrooms as a scientific rebuttal
of evolution.
</P>
<P>
? The Discovery Institute of Seattle, which calls itself "the nation's
leading research organization and think tank on intelligent design," said
the case pits "the ACLU against the local school board
over its decision to introduce intelligent design into biology classes."
</P>
<P>
?The institute says it supports scientists who are developing the emerging
theory of intelligent design."
</P>
<P>
? These include Charles Thaxton, a Peachtree City, Ga., man sometimes
credited with coining the phrase "intelligent design."
</P>
<P>
? Thaxton told lawyers in a deposition that he knew no
one on the Dover school board and had nothing to
do with the board's decision to incorporate the idea into
the biology course.
</P>
<P>
? In arguing that the Dover school board is attempting to
promote a religion, the parents cite cases as old as
the 1925 Scopes Trial in Tennessee and as recent as
a U.S. district court decision earlier this year against the
Cobb County, Ga., school board's decision to place stickers disputing
the theory of evolution on biology text books. ? ?
</P>
<P>
? But much of the legal jockeying leading up to the
trial's Sept. 26 opening in the state capital of Harrisburg
has gravitated to public statements purportedly made by members of
the school board last year as they debated and then
voted, 6-3, to include intelligent design in the biology course.
</P>
<P>
? At that time, Bill Buckingham, chairman of the board's curriculum
committee, was quoted as saying a textbook selected by science
teachers for the course was "laced with Darwinism."
</P>
<P>
? Asked if he was promoting Christianity in the public school,
Buckingham replied that "this country wasn't founded on Muslim beliefs
or evolution" but "on Christianity, and our students should be
taught as such," according to plaintiff's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
? He also proposed that the board buy "Of Pandas and
People" as a supplementary biology text, but was voted down.
</P>
<P>
? The father of another school board member then donated money
to buy 60 copies of the book, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
?School board lawyers, without identifying Buckingham by name, say the plaintiffs
based much of their case on newspaper accounts of a
board member "who, wrestling with addiction to Oxycontin (a pain
medication), occasionally allowed political opponents or reporters to put words
in his mouth."
</P>
<P>
? The board's lawyers said the plaintiffs had tried but failed
to prove that "a cabal of zealots bent on a
religious mission" had "ramrodded the curriculum change heedless of the
science faculty or community."
</P>
<P>
? Instead, the board's lawyers said, the change was thoroughly debated
and board members concluded that "evolution is a theory (not
a fact) and that components of the theory ... are
contested on scientific grounds."
</P>
<P>
(Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
? In its October resolution, the board ordered that students be
read the following statement before taking up evolution:
</P>
<P>
? "Because Darwin's Theory is a theory, it is still being
tested as new evidence is discovered.?The Theory is not a
fact.?Gaps in the Theory exist for which there is no
evidence. A theory is defined as a well-tested explanation that
unifies a broad range of observations.
</P>
<P>
? "Intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life
that differs from Darwin's view. The reference book, 'Of Pandas
and People,' is available for students to see if they
would like to explore this view in an effort to
gain an understanding of what intelligent design actually involves. As
is true with any theory, students are encouraged to keep
an open mind."

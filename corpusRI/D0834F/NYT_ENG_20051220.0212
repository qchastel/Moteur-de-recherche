INTELLIGENT DESIGN DEALT MAJOR SETBACK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - A federal judge in Pennsylvania Tuesday ruled that intelligent
design is "nothing less than the progeny of creationism" and
should not be taught in public schools.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, handed down by a judge appointed by President Bush,
is a major legal setback for proponents of intelligent design,
which holds that living organisms are so complex they cannot
be explained by evolution and must be the work of
a higher power. Christian right leaders have argued that it
should be taught in school systems across the country.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, the first legal test of intelligent design, comes after
a six-week trial in which expert witnesses and parents on
both sides of the dispute took the stand to argue
their positions on a Dover, Pa., school board policy requiring
science teachers to inform students of "gaps" in Charles Darwin's
theory of evolution and to share competing views, including intelligent
design.
</P>
<P>
Intelligent design proponents, mindful of legal barriers against teaching creationism in
public schools, have long argued that their theory passes constitutional
muster because it is not based in religion. They use
the term "intelligent designer," rather than God, to describe an
omniscient force behind life on earth, and they draw on
a pool of scientists to raise questions that they say
Darwin's theory fails to answer.
</P>
<P>
But in a sweeping 139-page opinion that went far beyond the
legality of the Dover policy, Judge John E. Jones III
concluded that intelligent design is religious and that its inclusion
in public school violates the constitutional separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
The ruling rebuked prominent intelligent design theorists, saying their assertion that
evolution cannot coexist with religious beliefs is "utterly false." Jones
also harshly condemned the Dover school board members who backed
it.
</P>
<P>
Those school officials, Jones charged, "time and again lie[d] to cover
their tracks and disguise the real purpose" behind promoting the
theory of intelligent design, which he said was to promote
religion.
</P>
<P>
Jones is a lifelong Republican who ran for Congress and narrowly
lost more than a decade ago. He has described his
mentor as Tom Ridge, the former Pennsylvania governor who served
as homeland security secretary. Bush appointed Jones to the bench
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely the decision will be appealed because a newly elected
Dover school board now opposes intelligent design.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the 11 parents who sued the school district say
Jones's decision sends a warning to other school districts considering
including intelligent design in their curricula.
</P>
<P>
"Although this is a decision by one district court, it is
a carefully reasoned and highly detailed decision that goes through
all the issues that will come up in any school
district," said plaintiff lawyer Richard B. Katskee of Americans United
for Separation of Church and State.
</P>
<P>
Jay D. Wexler, a Boston University law professor who has written
scholarly articles on intelligent design, said that while the ruling
is limited to one district, "the decision is so extremely
broad and negative towards intelligent design that I do think
it will have some chilling effect" on school districts considering
ways to cast doubt on evolution.
</P>
<P>
But John West, senior fellow of the Seattle-based Discovery Institute, a
leading promoter of intelligent design, predicted that the ruling will
spark renewed interest in the theory. "Americans don't like to
be told what to think about and what to study,"
he said, adding that "intelligent design ultimately will rise or
fall on scientific evidence."
</P>
<P>
"This judge obviously thought he had this important place in history,
so why not get up on his soap box," West
added. "But he failed as a matter of law."
</P>
<P>
Citing both scientists appearing at the trial and leading authors on
intelligent design, the Pennsylvania judge repeatedly referred to intelligent design's
"religious nature and aspirations."
</P>
<P>
"Although proponents of [intelligent design] occasionally suggest that the designer could
be a space alien or a time-travelling cell biologist, no
serious alternative to God as the designer has been proposed,"
Jones wrote. "It is notable that not one defense expert
was able to explain how the supernatural action suggested by
ID could be anything other than an inherently religious proposition."
</P>
<P>
This fall's trial inside a Harrisburg, Pa., courtroom drew comparisons to
the famed 1925 Scopes trial, in which evolutionary theory was
pitted against Christian fundamentalism in the trial of a Tennessee
teacher who defied a state law by teaching evolution. Like
the Scopes trial, the Dover case spilled over into the
political arena.
</P>
<P>
Senator Rick Santorum, a conservative Pennsylvania Republican and member of the
Senate leadership, has said that intelligent design is a "legitimate
scientific theory that should be taught in science classes." President
Bush fanned the fires in August when he told a
group of Texas newspaper reporters that he thought intelligent design
should be taught alongside evolution as competing theories.
</P>
<P>
And in November, after Dover voters bounced eight of the nine
school board members supporting intelligent design out of office, televangelist
Pat Robertson warned residents that "if there is a disaster
in your area, don't turn to God, you just rejected
Him from your city."
</P>
<P>
In 1968 the Supreme Court struck down an Arkansas ban on
the teaching of evolution. Subsequent attempts to inject creationism back
into the classroom - including "balanced treatment" statutes that required
creationism to be taught alongside evolution - have also been
blocked by courts.
</P>
<P>
The Discovery Institute, the most prominent proponent of intelligent design, had
distanced itself from the Dover school board's action because it
supports the voluntary, not mandated, teaching of intelligent design in
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
"We were queasy about" the Dover school board action, said West,
because it went too far.
</P>
<P>
The Discovery Institute and other intelligent-design proponents are hoping for a
more favorable outcome for school policies that cast doubt on
evolution but don't mandate teaching alternative theories. In particular, the
US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit is expected
to hand down a ruling soon over a requirement that
biology books in Cobb County, Georgia carry stickers stating that
evolution is "a theory, not a fact."
</P>
<P>
The Discovery Institute also supported a Kansas school board policy, adopted
last month, that injects language that is critical of evolution
into statewide standards.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Pennsylvania district court's broad assault on intelligent design was
widely viewed as a serious setback for its proponents.
</P>
<P>
The judge repeatedly cited the "religious" nature of intelligent design writings,
and quoted a Discovery Institute document stating that the intelligent
design's governing goals are to "defeat scientific materialism and its
destructive moral, cultural and political legacies" and to "replace materialistic
explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings
are created by God."
</P>
<P>
Jones also chastised the Dover school board members who embraced intelligent
design "despite a collective failure to understand" the theory and
in the face of "consistent and unwelcome advice from the
District's science teachers who uniformly opposed the change."
</P>
<P>
The only outside groups consulted were the Discovery Institute and another
intelligent design group "and it is clear that these contacts
was to obtain legal advice, as opposed to science education
information."

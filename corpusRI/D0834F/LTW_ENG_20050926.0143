Pennsylvania Case Is Newest Round in Evolution Debate

New barrages sounded in the evolution war Monday
as lawyers for a group of parents challenged the teaching of
intelligent design as nothing more than an old argument for God's hand
wrapped in fancy new cloth.
</P>
<P>
``This clever tactical repackaging of creationism does not merit
consideration,'' Witold Walczak, legal director of the Pennsylvania
American Civil Liberties Union and a lawyer for the parents, told U.S.
District Judge John E. Jones in opening arguments. ``Intelligent
design admits that it is not science unless science is redefined to
include the supernatural.''
</P>
<P>
This is, he added, ``a 21st century version of creationism.''
</P>
<P>
Eleven parents from Dover, in central Pennsylvania, are seeking to
block their school board from requiring that high school biology
teachers read a four-paragraph statement to students that casts doubt
on Darwin's theory of evolution. This mandatory statement notes that
intelligent design offers an alternative theory for the origin and
evolution of life -- namely, that life in all of its complexity could
not have arisen without the help of an intelligent hand.
</P>
<P>
The foremost advocates of intelligent design are silent on whether
that intelligent hand belongs to God or some other intelligent force,
even including a space alien. The school board, represented by the
Thomas More Law Center, a conservative, religiously grounded nonprofit
firm, took the position that the case was about freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
``There is in fact a controversy over Darwin's theory,'' Richard
Thompson, chief counsel for the law center, said afterward during an
impromptu news conference on the courthouse steps. ``Clearly both
theories have religious implications. But this is not about God.''
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, Dover school board members -- who voted 6-3 for
the new policy -- made it clear that they believed that the origin of
life was guided by a heavenly hand. Several of them suggested that
their views on evolution are far closer to Young Earth Creationism,
which holds that God created the world 6,000 years ago and that Noah's
flood covered Earth, than to intelligent design.
</P>
<P>
One board member told a public meeting -- in a remark he has since
tried to deny -- that the nation ``was founded on Christianity, and our
students should be taught as such.''
</P>
<P>
The war over the teaching of evolution is almost a century old, the
first great shot having been fired in Dayton, Tenn., in the famous
1925 Scopes ``monkey trial,'' in which the ACLU defended a teacher
convicted of teaching evolution. Former presidential candidate and
prairie populist Williams Jennings Bryan represented the school board.
Another shot sounded in 1987, when the Supreme Court prohibited the
teaching of creationism in public schools, ruling that it was not
science but religion, and violated the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that Supreme Court ruling, intelligent design began
to appear on the lecture circuit, championed by a small band of
scientists and academics. Intelligent design advocates tend to
concentrate their criticism on Darwinian theory; they have been far
less successful at laying a foundation for a new scientific theory,
which by definition must be testable.
</P>
<P>
This was a point hammered at Monday as the ACLU called its first
witness, Kenneth R. Miller, a Brown University biology professor and
author of a biology textbook used in nearly half the schools in the
nation -- including in Dover. Miller noted that virtually every
prominent scientific organization in the United States has upheld
Darwin's theory of evolution as an unshakeable pillar of science.
</P>
<P>
Intelligent design, he emphasized, has not fared nearly as well.
</P>
<P>
``Intelligent design is inherently religious. It is a form of
creationism,'' Miller said during four hours of testimony that often
came to resemble an extended college seminar. ``If you invoke a
spiritual force in science, I can't test or replicate it.
</P>
<P>
``Scientific theories are not hunches,'' he added. ``When we say
'theory,' we mean a strong, overarching explanation that ties together
many facts and enables us to make testable predictions.''
</P>
<P>
The school board's attorneys countered by arguing that several of
the leading intelligent design theorists are respected scientists and
professors. And they said the school board merely makes students aware
of another viewpoint. The board also mandated the placement in the
school library of the book ``Of Pandas and People.'' The book makes
the case for intelligent design, and the school board's attorneys made
the case that it was sort of an alternative textbook.
</P>
<P>
But Miller rejoined in his testimony that it was nothing of the
sort. He pointed out many examples of outdated or distorted science in
the book. He said the errors were so numerous as to amount to an
intentional misreading of science, designed to drive unwary students
to reject evolutionary theory.
</P>
<P>
``The errors in the book are systematic,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides plan to call a long line of witnesses, from scientists
to philosophers to local teachers and parents. And, in a rare moment
of agreement, they said the case is likely to eventually reach the
Supreme Court.

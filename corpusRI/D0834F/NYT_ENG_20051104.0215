TRIAL OVER INTELLIGENT DESIGN ENDS; JUDGE TO DECIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HARRISBURG, Pa.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's first trial to test the constitutionality
of teaching intelligent design as science ended Friday with a
lawyer for the pro-design Dover school board pronouncing it "the
next great paradigm shift in science."
</P>
<P>
His opponent, an attorney for the 11 parents suing the school
board, dismissed intelligent design as dishonest, unscientific and based entirely
on "a meager little analogy that collapses immediately upon inspection."
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of the six-week long trial in U.S. District Court
on Friday made it clear that two separate but interconnected
entities are actually on trial: the Dover school board and
the fledgling intelligent design movement.
</P>
<P>
The board in Dover, a growing town south of Harrisburg, voted
last year to read to ninth grade biology students a
four-paragraph statement saying that there are "gaps" in the theory
of evolution, and that intelligent design is an alternative they
should explore.
</P>
<P>
At the trial, board members repeatedly said they wanted to "encourage
critical thinking." But the parents presented evidence that the board's
purpose was religious and that the intelligent design statement was
a compromise they settled for after learning they could not
teach creationism.
</P>
<P>
On another level were dueling scientists: those who argued that intelligent
design is an exciting new explanation, versus those who testified
that it does not deserve to be called science.
</P>
<P>
The case will be decided by Judge John E. Jones III,
who said he hopes to issue his ruling before the
end of the year, or early January at the latest.
</P>
<P>
The scientists who advocate intelligent design explained that the complexity of
biological organisms and the "purposeful arrangement of parts" are evidence
that there is a designer. They said their theory is
not religious because they are not claiming the designer is
God, since that is untestable.
</P>
<P>
In his blunt closing argument, the plaintiffs' lawyer, Eric Rothschild, accused
the intelligent design movement of lying just like he said
the school board members had lied when they testified that
their purpose for changing the science curriculum had nothing to
do with religion.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the school board, Patrick Gillen, said in closing
arguments that while some board members had strong religious beliefs,
neither their "primary purpose" nor the effect of their policy
was to advance religion.
</P>
<P>
One question now is whether the judge will base his ruling
more narrowly on the specific actions of the Dover board,
or more broadly on the permissibility of teaching intelligent design
in public school science classes.

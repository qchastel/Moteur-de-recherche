EDITORIAL: NOT SCIENCE AT ALL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 20,000 residents of the rural Dover school district outside Harrisburg,
Pa., won a small victory in court. But it's a
significant decision for science education in public schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Residents of that school district already had taken matters into their
own hands by voting in the Nov. 9 school board
election to oust eight school board members who supported an
anti-evolution, pro-creationism policy.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, in an important court decision, U.S. District Judge John E.
Jones III ruled that Dover school board members violated the
U.S. Constitution with a policy whose real purpose was "to
promote religion in the public school classroom."
</P>
<P>
The Dover policy required ninth-grade biology students to listen to a
statement that, according to the judge, required teachers to "denigrate
or disparage" evolution, to refer to a "religious alternative masquerading
as a scientific theory" and to direct them to a
"creationist text as though it were a science resource."
</P>
<P>
The judge, a Republican appointed to the federal bench three years
ago, linked the notion of intelligent design in a straight
line back to creationism and fundamentalist attacks on evolution in
the 1920s. As such, it is part of "historical and
ongoing religiously driven attempts to advance creationism while denigrating evolution."
Advocates have merely recast creationism in scientific-sounding language.
</P>
<P>
At root, noted Jones, is a "contrived dualism" -- certain fundamentalists
believe that people must either believe in evolution or in
biblical creationism, in God or in godless science. Yet evolution
takes no position on religion. As Jones concluded, evolution "in
no way conflicts with, nor does it deny, the existence
of a divine creator."
</P>
<P>
Jones made it clear that any objective observer, adult or child,
looking at the Dover school district policy could see that
it was a creationist, religious strategy that evolved from earlier
forms of creationism. It's possible that the supernatural "intelligent designer"
they refer to could be a space alien or a
time-traveling cell biologist, but everyone knows the designer they refer
to is the God of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the intelligent design movement, testified proponents in court,
is to change the ground rules of science to include
the supernatural.
</P>
<P>
After an exhaustive examination, Jones stated unequivocally that intelligent design is
not science: "While supernatural explanations may be important and have
merit, they are not part of science" and have "no
place in a science curriculum."
</P>
<P>
The whole project of relabeling creationism as intelligent design is bad
enough. But school board members also lied, the judge said,
time and again "to cover their tracks and disguise the
real purpose" of their policy. One board member even lied
about his role in collecting donations from his church to
buy 60 copies of a creationist book to give to
the school district.
</P>
<P>
Dover's new school board president said the board intends to remove
intelligent design from the science curriculum and has no intention
of appealing Jones' decision. That's a good thing, and other
school boards should follow Dover's lead in abandoning the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
Students, parents and teachers deserved better than to be "dragged into
this legal maelstrom," the judge said, calling the matter a
huge waste of money and time. He intends to award
damages and fees, sending a message to other would-be creationists
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
A "creationism-in-disguise" policy imposes particular religious beliefs on children in public
schools, interfering with parents' rights to educate their children as
they see fit about religion. And not only is it
bad science, it's not science at all.

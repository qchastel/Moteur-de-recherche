ENGINEERS WORK TO KEEP POWER ON IN TEXAS HEAT

<P>
In a hushed, dimly lit room in Austin,
Texas, and in an identical space in nearby Taylor, people
responsible for keeping the lights on in Texas intently scrutinize
computer monitors 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
Above them hangs a bank of displays 16 feet high by
32 feet wide that silently blink with changing data impenetrable
to the average person.
</P>
<P>
The workers also gaze at something more familiar: two monitors displaying
The Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
Those in the control room are employees of a quasi-governmental entity
called ERCOT, the Electrical Reliability Council of Texas. ERCOT's job
is to make sure the power doesn't go out in
Texas. The agency operates and maintains Texas' electric grid, which
serves 85 percent of all of the state's electricity users
and covers 75 percent of the state's sprawling geographic area.
</P>
<P>
As the first hot days of Texas summer count down to
the scorching temperatures of late July and August, ERCOT managers
say the grid is prepared. It's ready to meet the
demands of 20 million Texans; ready to deal with another
peak day like that of Aug. 7, 2003, when the
state's electrical usage reached a record 60,095 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Most Texans knew little of the grid until August 2003, when
the nation's largest power outage caused blackouts in the Northeast.
Studies of the outages indicated problems in Canada cascaded into
the Northeast, leaving New York and Detroit without power for
days.
</P>
<P>
Texas, residents were told, is protected from power outages outside the
state because the system isn't connected to other major grids
in North America. The Texas grid covers the state except
for parts of East Texas, the El Paso area and
parts of the Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
"It's true -- the Texas grid is isolated from every other
state, so what happens in other regions will have no
effect on us," said Mitty Plummer, associate professor of engineering
technology at the University of North Texas.
</P>
<P>
The grid consists of the biggest power transmission lines -- lines
strung from big steel towers -- that carry as much
as 345,000 volts.
</P>
<P>
ERCOT is responsible for making sure electric generation across the state
matches the load, or usage. It's a delicate balancing act
to manage the scheduling of power.
</P>
<P>
At ERCOT's control centers in Taylor -- a bunkerlike building designed
to withstand a Force 3 tornado with winds up to
206 mph -- and its backup center in Austin, computer
programs help workers monitor electrical generation and usage.
</P>
<P>
On a recent day at ERCOT's Austin control room, it was
quiet as about half a dozen workers monitored the system.
But if there's an imbalance between power generation and usage,
"things can get pretty tense and challenging," ERCOT spokeswoman Dottie
Roark said.
</P>
<P>
"It takes a certain kind of person, because they can't go
out to lunch or dinner. They pretty much live here
for 12 hours."
</P>
<P>
Experts in the control room closely monitor frequency -- the heartbeat
of the system -- that reflects the relationship between electrical
generation and usage. At 60 hertz, generation matches usage exactly.
Second by second, 24 hours a day, control-room experts strive
to keep Texas' grid as close to 60 hertz as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Its control room uses sophisticated computer programs that forecast demand, plan
for emergencies and make adjustments. The 60 hertz goal is
just "a continual target, because every time somebody flips a
light switch, it changes," said Paul Wattles, ERCOT's manager of
governmental relations and communications.
</P>
<P>
There's constant communication between ERCOT and every utility that's part of
the grid.
</P>
<P>
"ERCOT is digesting real-time data from everybody, and they'll change generation
patterns to match the load," said Bill Woolsey, assistant chief
transmission operator at CPS, the electric utility in San Antonio.If
there's a drastic, non-routine mismatch -- too much usage and
not enough power generation, or vice versa -- "it can
cascade into a lot of problems," Woolsey said.
</P>
<P>
Weather patterns provide big clues to power usage. "At ERCOT, we're
obsessed about the weather," spokeswoman Roark said, because the system
needs to be ready to respond to demand.
</P>
<P>
Stable as it is, the Texas grid could be threatened by
a huge storm, by multiple equipment failures or by terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a presentation last year to the Texas Legislature, ERCOT officials
said the grid is prepared for emergencies regardless of cause.
</P>
<P>
"We could lose any single, major element of the system --
one outage caused by a tornado or sabotage -- and
it wouldn't put us at risk," said Kent Saathoff, ERCOT's
director of systems operations.
</P>
<P>
It would take a massive, coordinated, simultaneous, forced outage -- basically
an act of war -- to bring down the Texas
grid, a key ERCOT official has told a Texas Senate
committee in response to a question about terrorism threats.
</P>
<P>
ERCOT also continually examines the grid's reserve margins of power --
the gap between available power and forecasted usage. "We make
sure that even if we hit a peak we have
enough power to meet the demand," Roark said.

EDITORIAL: VIRTUALLY UNPROTECTED

The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June

When the East Coast and Midwest were hit by a blackout
in 2003, the first fear of many people was that
terrorists had attacked the electricity grid. It turned out not
to have been terrorism, but the fears were well founded.
Experts have long warned that the nation's power, transportation and
communications systems are vulnerable to "cyberattacks" that could devastate the
economy and cause huge damage to life and property. Now
a new government report has concluded that far too little
is being done to close these gaps.
</P>

After Sept. 11, 2001, a group of leading scientists sent a
stern warning to President Bush about the danger of a
computer-based terrorist attack on the nation's infrastructure. They called for
the creation of a major Cyber-Warfare Defense Project, modeled on
the Manhattan Project, to prevent, detect and respond to potential
attacks. "Fast and resolute mitigating action is needed to avoid
national disaster," the scientists warned.

Power grids, water treatment and distribution systems, major dams, and oil
and chemical refineries are all controlled today by networked computers.
Computers make the nation's infrastructure far more efficient, but they
also make it more vulnerable. A well-planned cyberattack could black
out large parts of the country, cut off water supplies
or worse. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that in 2003
a malicious, invasive program called the Slammer worm infected the
computer network at a nuclear power plant and disabled its
safety monitoring system for nearly five hours.
</P>
<P>
Despite the warnings after 9/11 -- and again after the 2003
blackout -- disturbingly little has been done. The Government Accountability
Office did a rigorous review of the Department of Homeland
Security's progress on every aspect of computer security, and its
findings are not reassuring. It found that the department has
not yet developed assessments of the threat of a cyberattack
or of how vulnerable major computer systems are to such
an attack, nor has it created plans for recovering key
Internet functions in case of an attack. The report also
expressed concern that many of the department's senior cybersecurity officials
have left in the past year. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the
California Democrat who was among those who requested the GAO
report, said last week that it proved that "a national
plan to secure our cybernetworks is virtually nonexistent."
</P>
<P>
Protecting the nation from a potentially devastating cyberattack is not easy.
The technological challenges are considerable -- even major technology companies
have trouble defending themselves against hackers. The number of potential
targets is enormous. And because many of the targets are
in private hands, the Department of Homeland Security has to
work with entities that may be reluctant to follow the
government's lead.
</P>
<P>
But overcoming these obstacles should be a high priority. One of
the lessons of the Sept. 11 attacks in New York
and Washington was how much damage a few men with
simple weapons, like box cutters, could do if they targeted
a point of maximum vulnerability. In a well-planned cyberattack, a
single terrorist with nothing more than a computer and Internet
access could do an extraordinary amount of harm from half
a world away.

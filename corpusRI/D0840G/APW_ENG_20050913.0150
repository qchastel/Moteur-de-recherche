Utility workers' gaffe cuts power to millions in Los Angeles

<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Major portions of the city lost power for more than an hour around lunchtime
after utility workers mistakenly cut several cables, causing a short that
sizzled through the system.
</P>
<P>
Police discounted terrorism almost immediately, though the timing of the outage
caused some concern: It came a day after Sept. 11 and the airing of videotape in
which a purported al-Qaida member threatened Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"We were all freaked out, no doubt," said downtown high-rise worker Vicki
Brakl.
</P>
<P>
Roughly 2 million people were affected by the resultant power surge and outages,
which trapped some in elevators and snarled intersections regionwide. All power
was restored by 3 p.m. (2200 GMT) Monday, about 2 1/2 hours later.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the blackout, many office workers seized the chance for an
extended lunch on a mild afternoon, even as police and fire sirens echoed in the
background.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just reading the paper and seeing a lot of my colleagues out here, so I
guess we all have a good excuse," said Ludwig Welsh as he ate his midday meal
outside his downtown insurance office.
</P>
<P>
There were few reports of injuries. Two men were briefly hospitalized after
inhaling toxic fumes at an oil refinery when smoke backed up after the power
went out, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
Though the Police Department ordered all officers to stay on their shifts and
surveyed the city by helicopter, law enforcement officials dismissed sabotage
even before the utility explained what happened.
</P>
<P>
Still, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa recognized that the timing "created a
heightened sense of concern."
</P>
<P>
The outage began at about 12:30 p.m. (1930 GMT) when workers installing an
automated alert system cut several wires simultaneously, instead of one at a
time, according to Ed Miller of the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power.
</P>
<P>
That caused the short that led to all the trouble. Utility officials initially
said the outage occurred when the cables were incorrectly reconnected.
</P>
<P>
The outage spread north into the San Fernando Valley and hit neighboring cities,
including Burbank and Glendale. But because of the region's patchwork utility
system, pockets of power remained, even as adjacent areas served by the city-run
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power were dark.
</P>
<P>
Though some power experts said the system performed correctly given the surge,
it was the latest indication of the electrical grid's vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, half a million Southern California Edison and DWP customers lost
power for 30 minutes when a transformer shut down automatically because an alarm
mistakenly went off.
</P>
<P>
A blackout in August 2003 that started in Ohio after tree limbs touched a power
line cascaded across the East and into Canada, affecting 50 million people. That
led to demands for more reliability and preparedness.
</P>
<P>
Inside one downtown high-rise Monday, Albert Vasquez had to pry his way out of
an elevator that shut down after the power failed.
</P>
<P>
"It was bizarre," he said. "It went completely dark."
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, 27, a customer service representative, opened the doors with his hands
and went outside.
</P>
<P>
Across the city, traffic was snarled at intersections when stop lights went
dark.
</P>
<P>
Katie Cerio, a stylist for TV commercials, said traffic signals were out in her
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
"They've got people directing traffic, but it's definitely a bit chaotic," Cerio
said as she drove. "But now I just entered West Hollywood and the traffic lights
seems to be on."
</P>
<P>
Gas station pumps stopped working, car washes came to a halt, assembly lines
stalled and restaurant machinery quit in the middle of lunch
hour.
</P>
<P>
At Bob's Big Boy restaurant in Burbank, power was out for about 90
minutes.
</P>
<P>
"All we could serve were salads and cold sandwiches, no hamburgers," manager
Frank Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
At the downtown YMCA, staff used flashlights to help usher exercisers from the
pool and other areas to locker rooms so they could dress before
evacuating.
</P>
<P>
Before its power was restored, UCLA Medical Center was on backup generators and
reported no danger to patients. Childrens Hospital Los Angeles was on backup
power and doctors planned to suspend all unneeded operations the rest of the
day, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The city's transit trains ran during the outage, but with major
delays.
</P>
<P>
"I walk faster than that," said commuter Jennifer Crocker, 27.

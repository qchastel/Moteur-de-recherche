Study: Many warning sirens at U.S. nuclear plants lack backup electric power

More than two dozen nuclear power plants across the United States lack sirens
that would warn of a nuclear emergency if electricity also was blacked out,
according to a report by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight U.S. plants lack backup power for sirens that are supposed to alert
residents in a 16-kilometer (10-mile) radius of trouble, the NRC said. Seventeen
plants have full backup for the systems, while 18 others have at least some
sirens that would remain operable during an outage.
</P>
<P>
The NRC released the information Wednesday as part of its response to a
coalition of 17 activist groups and elected officials that petitioned the
commission in February for information about the siren systems.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we have an inoperable emergency system at a majority of the sites,"
said Paul Gunter, director of the Reactor Watchdog Project for the Washington,
D.C.-based Nuclear Information and Resource Service.
</P>
<P>
Plants that lack any backup power for sirens include the Indian Point plant just
north of New York City and the Davis-Besse plant near Toledo, Ohio. At Three
Mile Island in Middletown, the site of a March 28, 1979, partial meltdown that
remains the worst U.S. nuclear plant accident, only 19 of the 96 sirens would
operate if power went out.
</P>
<P>
During mock terror attacks on plants, NRC officials assume electric power would
be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Working sirens would be crucial since a loss of electricity can challenge
nuclear plants' safety shutdown systems and heighten the risk of a core-melting
accident, nuclear watchdog groups said.
</P>
<P>
The groups have asked the NRC to step in and require plant owners to provide
backup power to the sirens. The NRC said siren upgrades are in the works at
about half the plants that lack warning systems that are fully backed
up.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is revising warning requirements
following the massive August 2003 electrical blackout in the northeastern United
States.
</P>
<P>
Todd Schneider, spokesman for Davis-Besse, said the sirens are only one part of
an emergency plan. Warning messages are also spread by police car loudspeakers
and radio stations.

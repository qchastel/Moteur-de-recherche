POWER GRID IS READY TO HANDLE SUMMER, INDUSTRY GROUP SAYS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York City region and all of New England should
have enough electric power to supply even a record demand
this summer, an organization that monitors the region's power grid
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Utility companies should not have to reduce the supply of power
to businesses or residential customers unless there is an unexpected
disruption or "extremely hot weather conditions," said Charles Durkin, chairman
of the Northeast Power Coordinating Council, a nonprofit group whose
members include utility executives and regulators. Last summer was unusually
cool and did not strain the system, he said.
</P>
<P>
But most New Yorkers remember the August 2003 blackout that kept
the city in the dark for a full day, and
many worry about another one. Energy industry officials offered no
guarantees that there would not be a recurrence, because that
blackout was caused by a breakdown in the transmission network
that started in Ohio and cascaded to New York.
</P>
<P>
They expressed confidence, though, that demand would not exceed supply anytime
soon in New York state or New England. New York
should have enough power to meet the state's requirement of
a cushion of 18 percent more electricity than the expected
peak demand in midsummer, Durkin said.
</P>
<P>
"We're in better shape than last year," said Edward A. Schwerdt,
the council's executive director.
</P>
<P>
The council projects that the maximum available supply of electricity in
New York state this summer will be 39,237 megawatts, which
is 7,000 megawatts more than expected peak demand and 8,000
more than have ever been used. For the entire Northeast,
the council projected that demand would peak in the week
of July 10 at 106,618 megawatts, leaving a cushion of
more than 9,000 megawatts of capacity.
</P>
<P>
The council's outlook was similar in tone to a report issued
last week by the New York Independent System Operator, which
coordinates the flow of electricity in the state.
</P>
<P>
"We're in good shape for this summer," Mark S. Lynch, the
president and chief executive of the system operator said in
an interview Thursday. "We feel comfortable from a supply-and-demand standpoint."
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lynch said, several improvements have been made to try
to prevent another disaster like the blackout of 2003. Engineers
monitoring the power grid in New York now have a
better view of what is happening on transmission lines in
neighboring states and can respond faster to offset problems that
start elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"We think we've done just about everything we can to protect
ourselves," Lynch said. Now, he said, Congress should force all
power system operators to adopt the same standards of reliability.
</P>
<P>
Lynch also expressed concern that not enough additional generation was planned.
Without more local sources of power, New York will become
increasingly reliant on imported electricity and could face shortages within
five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody needs to panic," he said. "But I
don't think enough is being done to create in-state generation."

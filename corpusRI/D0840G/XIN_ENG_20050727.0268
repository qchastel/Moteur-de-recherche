Record heat strains power grid in US: newspaper

<P>
The intense heat wave sweeping 
much of the United States is pushing electricity demand to new 
records, a situation that is stressing the power grid, the Wall 
Street Journal reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Little more than a month into summer, said the report, new 
benchmarks for daily electricity use already have been set in 
Atlanta, Cincinnati, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, among 
other cities.
</P>
<P>
New York set a new record Tuesday of 32,075 megawatts, breaking
the previous high set just last week.
</P>
<P>
The United States as a whole likely set a new record for weekly
electricity use last week, topping by as much as 4 percent the 
previous record demand of 90,640 gigawatt hours, set Aug. 3, 2002,
according to the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association 
representing major utilities. A gigawatt represents one billion 
watts.
</P>
<P>
The surge reflects not just the unusually widespread heat, but 
also a recent upward creep in industrial electricity usage, the 
report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the surging demand provides another big stress 
test for the nation's power grid. In August 2003, a big Northeast 
blackout disrupted service to 50 million people. Two years earlier,
soaring prices and isolated blackouts rolled across California.
</P>
<P>
Since those events, regulators and power companies have made 
changes in their operations designed to help them stay abreast of 
system conditions and head off problems.
</P>
<P>
So far, the improved planning, combined with the addition of a 
number of new power plants, seems to be helping the system's 
reliability, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The omnibus energy bill making its way through Congress also 
could bring changes, by putting in place enforceable electricity 
reliability standards that could force further improvements and 
spur a new generation of nuclear power plants, it added.
</P>
<P>
Still, the report said that the run-up in demand is using up a 
cushion of surplus power that has moderated prices in recent years.
That increases the risk of supply problems developing in a few 
areas. Some places, too, are poorly served by transmission lines, 
raising concern that a rapid boost in demand could create 
temporary shortages.

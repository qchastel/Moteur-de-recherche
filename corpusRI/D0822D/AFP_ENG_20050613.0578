The White House said Monday that 
Lebanon's parliamentary elections appeared to be going well but said 
the United States still worries about Syrian influence over its 
neighbor's internal affairs.

<P>
"Generally speaking, people feel that the elections are being 
conducted well," spokesman Scott McClellan said with three rounds of 
voting completed and one more round remaining.
</P>
<P>
"I think most people are looking at this and would say that the 
people of Lebanon are casting votes for change. But in terms of the 
actual individuals that are being elected, that's up to the people 
of Lebanon to decide," he said.

The elections were the first since Syria withdrew its military 
in April, after a 29-year military presence, in the turmoil that 
followed the February killing of former premier Rafiq Hariri.

<P>
"What we want to make sure is that there are free and fair 
elections and that there is no outside interference or intimidation 
going on inside Lebanon. That means Syria needs to stop meddling 
inside Lebanon," said McClellan.
</P>
<P>
"We have real concerns about Syria's continued intelligence 
presence inside Lebanon," said McClellan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said UN verification teams should return to 
Lebanon and stay there through the formation of a cabinet in order 
to certify whether Syria is complying with a UN resolution calling 
for Damascus to withdraw from its neighbor's affairs.

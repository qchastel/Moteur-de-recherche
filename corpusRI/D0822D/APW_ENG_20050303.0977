Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Thursday he is sending a top envoy back to
Beirut and Damascus to discuss U.N. demands for a Syrian withdrawal from
Lebanon, which he said must be handled with care.
</P>
<P>
Terje Roed-Larsen, the U.N.'s former Mideast envoy who is still handling the
Syria-Lebanon issue, will prepare a report on Syria's compliance with a Security
Council resolution demanding the pullout of its 15,000 troops and intelligence
agents.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrians have indicated that they are planning to withdraw the troops from
Lebanon," Annan told reporters. "Will it be complete withdrawal, partial
withdrawal?"
</P>
<P>
Annan said he hopes when he submits the report to the Security Council in April
"that I will be able to report progress."
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general was asked how soon he would like to see the Syrians
withdraw, and how concerned he was that a speedy pullout might create a
political vacuum that might unsettle Syria's adversaries, the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it's a situation one has to handle with care," Annan said, adding
that all interested parties are aware of the need to avoid precipitating "a
situation that could destabilize Lebanon or cause tensions."
</P>
<P>
Roed-Larsen was in the region last month and his office said contacts were being
made with the Syrian and Lebanese governments on dates for his
return.
</P>
<P>
Pressure on Syria to withdraw its troops and intelligence agents has intensified
since the slayings of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and 16 others
in a Feb. 14 bombing. Many Lebanese blame Syria for the assassination, though
Damascus vehemently denies any involvement.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's worst political crisis in years has increasingly isolated Syria, with
Egypt and Saudi Arabia stepping in to encourage Damascus to withdraw. Even
Syria's traditional ally, Russia, joined the United States, France and the
United Nations in calling for a pullout.
</P>
<P>
Syria sent troops in 1976 to help quell a civil war in Lebanon. They remained
through 14 years of fighting and are still there. Damascus is seen as pulling
the strings in Lebanese politics _ most recently in pressing for a
constitutional amendment to allow a second term for pro-Syrian President Emile
Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted a resolution Sept. 2 calling on Syria to pull all
its troops from its smaller neighbor and urging Lebanon's parliament not to
amend the constitution. Defying the council, parliament approved an amendment
hours later extending Lahoud's term for three years.

An opposition leader charged Thursday that Syrian military intelligence was
still operating in Lebanon, six weeks after Syria withdrew its troops from the
country, and said he feared there would be more assassinations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on local television, Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon's Druse
community, said Syrian generals had been spotted in eastern Bekaa Valley and
central Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Officially, the Syrians have left. But on the intelligence level they stayed,"
Jumblatt said in a talk show on LBC television.
</P>
<P>
Syrian intelligence in Lebanon "is not to monitor Israel. It is in order for the
tutelage and the sabotage to continue," he said, referring to Syria's past
domination of the Lebanese security service.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese intelligence apparatus, or its remnants, and the Syrian
intelligence apparatus still exist in Lebanon," Jumblatt added.
</P>
<P>
His comments came ahead of a U.N. envoy's traveling to Damascus this weekend to
meet the Syrian President Bashar Assad. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Thursday he was considering sending another team to verify the reports of Syrian
intelligence operatives remaining in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. military team was sent to Lebanon last month to verify the withdrawal of
all Syrian troops and intelligence operatives, as called for by the U.N.
Security Council in a September 2004 resolution. It verified the pullout of all
Syrian troops, but said it could not be certain that all intelligence operatives
had left Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
U.N. diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several countries have
told Annan there is evidence that Syrian intelligence operatives are still in
Lebanon, performing a variety of activities.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have made no secret of their concern that Syrian intelligence
officers may still be in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In his interview, Jumblatt said Brig. Gen. Rustum Ghazale, Syria's last
intelligence chief in Lebanon, was seen having lunch in one of the restaurants
in the eastern Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border. He also said several Syrian
generals were spotted in Lebanon. They include Ali Diab and Mahmoud Jabbour, who
were spotted in the Chouf, the Druse heartland in central Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Jumblatt expressed fears of further assassinations after last week's bombing
that killed the anti-Syrian journalist, Samir Kassir.
</P>
<P>
"Probably there is a decision _ with the knowledge or without the knowledge of
President Assad _ to continue the assassinations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's opposition has blamed Syria and its Lebanese allies in the government
for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in bomb explosion on
Feb. 14 that killed 20 others people. His killing sparked mass anti-Syrian
protests in Lebanon and intensified international pressure for Syria to withdraw
its army. The pullout was completed April 26.

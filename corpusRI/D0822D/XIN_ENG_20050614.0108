Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on 
Tuesday met with visiting Saudi Foreign Minister Saud bin al-Faisal
over the Syria-Lebanon issue, Egypt's official MENA news agency 
reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting "covered Arab issues, especially the latest 
developments in Syria and Lebanon," Presidential spokesman Soliman 
Awad was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Awad skipped a question whether Mubarak will visit Syria soon, 
but said Mubarak's "consultations are constant with all parties 
concerned in containing the situation in Syria and Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Syria was forced to withdraw forces from Lebanon at the end of 
April by mass anti-Syrian protests in Lebanon and mounting 
international pressure to quit its tiny neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The outpouring of public anger was triggered by the 
assassination of former Lebanese Premier Rafik Hariri on Feb. 14 in
a massive bombing in central Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Faisal arrived here earlier Tuesday on a brief visit to Egypt. 
The Saudi minister left for home after talks with Mubarak.

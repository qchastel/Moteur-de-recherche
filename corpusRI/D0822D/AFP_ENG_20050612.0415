<P>
Syria's ambassador to the United 
States denied Sunday that Damascus has a "hit list" targeting 
Lebanese opposition leaders and insisted that his country had 
withdrawn intelligence officers from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Ambassador Imad Moustapha told CNN it was in his 
country's "strategic interest" to have the "best possible" relations 
with its smaller neighbor, whose political opposition held protests 
this year against Syria's 29-year troop presence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"There are forces that don't want to see a good, friendly, 
brotherly relation between Syria and Lebanon, and they are creating 
this myth and these stories about Syria going to kill Lebanese 
leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
President George W. Bush on Friday called on Syria to remove 
intelligence agents from Lebanon, while White House spokesman Scott 
McClellan said Washington had heard reports of a Syrian "hit list" 
against key Lebanese public figures.
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that the world's unique superpower, the United 
States of America, would degrade itself to this level," Moustapha 
said.
</P>
<P>
"Do you instigate against a whole country based on 
unsubstantiated wild stories," he said, adding that the allegations 
have "exceeded all limits of wisdom and of logic."
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that Syria has removed all troops and 
intelligence agents from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We have made a strategic decision. We have withdrawn from 
Lebanon completely and categorically, every Syrian troop, every 
Syrian agent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sinister campaign against Syria that is unjustified, 
inacurate and unfair," Moustapha said.
</P>
<P>
A US- and French-backed UN Security Council resolution passed in 
September ordered all foreign nations to withdraw their forces from 
Lebanon, whose voters on Sunday went to the polls for a third round 
of legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The elections, which will be held in four stages, is the first 
balloting free of Syria's military presence, and follows the 
February killing of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri which plunged 
Lebanon into turmoil.

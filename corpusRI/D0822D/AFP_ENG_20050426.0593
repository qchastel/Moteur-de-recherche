WASHINGTON, April 26
</DATELINE>

<P>
The United States on Tuesday hailed 
Syria's troop pullout from Lebanon as a "historic" day for the 
Lebanese but stayed wary of Damascus' intention pending UN 
verification of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Officials here also ducked questions on whether the move would 
improve strained US-Syrian relations and lead to the return of 
Washington's ambassador to Damascus who was recalled for 
consultations in February.
</P>
<P>
"We think today is a historic day for Lebanon and its people," 
Ereli told the daily State Department briefing. "After almost three 
decades Syria has withdrawn its military forces from Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He called the pullout "an important first step" towards 
compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1559 adopted last 
year to order Syria's forces out of neighboring Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Syria was also obliged to withdraw its 
intelligence officers and "I think there are some lingering concerns 
that not all Syrian intelligence assets are out of Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has sent a team of inspectors to Lebanon and 
Damascus, Ereli said, and "we await the report of this verification 
team to provide a considered judgment on whether the withdrawal is 
complete."

A U.N. team has verified the pullout of all Syrian troops and intelligence
officials from Lebanon, Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced
Monday.

"We have verified all the withdrawal, including the border area," he told
reporters.

<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution last Sept. 2 calling on Syria to
withdraw all its troops and intelligence operatives from Lebanon. But it was the
international pressure following the Feb. 14 assassination of Lebanon's former
anti-Syrian prime minister, Rafik Hariri, that spurred the Syrians to
leave.

<P>
Syria's last soldier in Lebanon walked across the border on April 26, ending a
29-year military presence that was the key to Damascus' control of
Lebanon.

<P>
The United Nations dispatched a team led by Senegalese Brig. Gen. Mouhamadou
Kandji, the deputy military adviser for the U.N. peacekeeping department, to
verify the withdrawal.

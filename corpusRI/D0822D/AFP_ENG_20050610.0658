<P>
US President George W. Bush issued a 
new warning to Syria on Friday to withdraw its forces from Lebanon, 
with the White House saying it believed the Damascus government has 
a hit list of opponents in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he was "disturbed" by reports that Syrian intelligence 
remain in Lebanon, in breach of a UN resolution ordering all Syrian 
forces out of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our message to Syria -- and it's not just the message of the 
United States; the United Nations has said the same thing -- is that 
in order for Lebanon to be free," Syria needs to "not only remove 
their military, but to remove intelligence officers as well," Bush 
said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday ordered a UN 
verification mission back to Lebanon because of reports of 
"elements" of Syrian intelligence still in the country which is 
halfway through a four-stage national election.
</P>
<P>
A UN Security Council resolution passed in September ordered all 
foreign nations to withdraw their forces from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria has strongly denied that any of its forces remain in the 
neighbouring country where it has had a predominant influence for 
three decades.
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, Information Minister Mehdi Dakhlallah said the 
comments by Bush and other US administration officials were "false 
and lacking in objectivity".
</P>
<P>
"All Syrian forces, whatever their service, have been withdrawn 
from Lebanon," the minister told the official SANA news agency.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the United States was 
"deeply concerned about Syria's interference and intimidation inside 
Lebanon." He welcomed the return of the UN mission.
</P>
<P>
"Syria needs to comply fully with United Nations Council 
Resolution 1559. That means getting all their intelligence 
operatives out of Lebanon," he added. "We are concerned that those 
intelligence operatives are interfering in Lebanon's internal 
affairs."
</P>
<P>
McClellan also spoke of a Syrian "hit list" of opponents of its 
influence.
</P>
<P>
"There are reports that we have been hearing about for some time 
about a Syrian hit list targeting key Lebanese public figures of 
various political and religious persuasions for assassination," 
McClellan told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the reports had resurfaced following the recent 
assassination of anti-Syrian journalist Samir Kassir.
</P>
<P>
The State Department has also warned about Syria's role in the 
Lebanese election, but spokesman Sean McCormack held back from the 
use of sanctions that could be applied under the Syria 
Accountability Act.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an issue between the US and Syria, this is an issue 
between Syria and the rest of the world," McCormack told a briefing 
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said that the number of Syrian agents in Lebanon had not reduced 
despite the withdrawal promise by Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Terje Roed-Larsen, the UN secretary general's envoy for Lebanon, 
is to meet Syria's President Bashir Al-Assad in Damascus on Sunday 
to discuss the Syrian withdrawal and the UN resolution.

Armstrong says he's victim of 'setup'; WADA to review lab work

_ Even facing the most serious drug allegations of his career, Lance Armstrong
says he sleeps well at night.
</P>
<P>
The seven-time Tour de France champion continues to try to beat back reports in
the French media that he used a banned blood booster in his first tour victory
in 1999. On Thursday, he lashed out at the French lab that produced the findings
in question.
</P>
<P>
"There's a setup here and I'm stuck in the middle of it," Armstrong told The
Associated Press. "I absolutely do not trust that laboratory."
</P>
<P>
The French sports daily L'Equipe reported Tuesday that new exams on six urine
samples Armstrong provided during the 1999 tour resulted in positive results for
the red blood cell-booster EPO.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong's comment came after Dick Pound, head of the World Anti-Doping Agency,
said officials had received the lab results and would review them. Armstrong
also said that while Pound might trust the lab that tested the samples, "I
certainly don't."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Armstrong elaborated on that distrust during an appearance on
CNN's "Larry King Live."
</P>
<P>
"A guy in a Parisian laboratory opens up your sample, you know, Jean Francois
so-and-so, and he tests it _ nobody's there to observe, no protocol was followed
_ and then you get a call from a newspaper that says `We found you to be
positive six times for EPO.' Well, since when did newspapers start governing
sports?"
</P>
<P>
Although frustrated by the report and the difficulty of proving his case,
Armstrong said he sleeps well at night knowing that he's competed
drug-free.
</P>
<P>
"All I can do is come on this stage and tell my story and be honest. I've always
done that," he said. "Since this stuff's rolled out, I sleep great at night ....
I don't have a problem looking at myself in the mirror."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong questions the validity of testing samples frozen six years ago, how
those samples were handled since, and how he could be expected to defend himself
when the only confirming evidence _ the 'A' sample used for the 1999 tests _ no
longer exists.
</P>
<P>
He also charged officials at the suburban Paris lab with violating WADA code for
failing to safeguard the anonymity of any remaining 'B' samples it
had.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, we all want clean sport," Armstrong told King. "And fortunately, an
organization called WADA has come along and has really governed the world of
anti-doping. They have set about a protocol and a code that everybody has to
live by. And (the lab) violated the code several times."
</P>
<P>
The French report appears stronger than previous doping allegations raised
against Armstrong, said Pound, the WADA chairman.
</P>
<P>
"There's been an awful lot of rumor and accusation about him for a number of
years, always of the he-said, she-said variety. This appears _ I haven't seen
the documents myself _ to have some documentary connection. That's a lot more
serious. It's got to be taken more seriously," Pound said.
</P>
<P>
"If he had one, you could say it was an aberration. When you get up to six,
there's got to be some explanation."
</P>
<P>
Pound said the lab is accredited by the International Olympic Committee and that
he trusts it handled the samples properly. Pound also questioned the need for
two samples to confirm a positive test.
</P>
<P>
"You can count on the fingers of one hand the times a B sample has not confirmed
the result of the A sample," Pound said. "It's almost always a delaying
tactic."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said that contradicts WADA's own drug testing policy.
</P>
<P>
"For the head of the agency to say he actually doesn't believe in the code ...
if your career is riding on the line, wouldn't you want a B sample?" Armstrong
told the AP. "The French have been after (me) forever, and `Whoops!' there's no
B sample? The stakes are too high."
</P>
<P>
Pound said the lab had asked WADA months ago if the agency was interested in
reviewing its findings and that he agreed. He said the agency didn't expect
names to be connected to the findings, but only wanted to see if the leftover
samples from 1999 would show riders used EPO.
</P>
<P>
"They said it's simply research," Pound said.
</P>
<P>
Pound said he's waiting for WADA Science Director Olivier Rabin to return from
Europe to review the results.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong told King he was tested dozens of times during all his Tour de France
races, and was under exceptional scrutiny _ including right before his final
race in June.
</P>
<P>
"Just a day before the start we had a knock on the door, and the minister of
sport had sent a crew down there to collect two samples of urine and two samples
of blood," Armstrong said. "And we checked around and found out that nobody else
in the peloton was tested that day. So I can't say 'witch hunt' loud
enough."

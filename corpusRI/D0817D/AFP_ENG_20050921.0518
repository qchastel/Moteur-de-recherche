French lab condemned over Armstrong doping slur

<P>
The IOC Athletes Commission and the 
Summer Olympic sports (ASOIF) have demanded the French lab that 
claimed Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong had tested positive 
for doping in 1999 be suspended.
</P>
<P>
The demand, in a letter to Dick Pound, the president of the 
World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and obtained by AFP, insists the 
laboratory broke a host of rules set down in the World Anti-Doping 
Code.
</P>
<P>
"The consequences of a positive test for an athlete are so 
severe that the procedures that lead to such a result must adhere to 
extremely strict rules and the results must be based on irrefutable 
evidence.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, it appears that numerous violations of the World 
Anti-Doping Code have been committed and that the most basic 
guarantees, for which every athlete has a right, have been held up 
to ridicule," said the letter, signed by ASOIF president Denis 
Oswald and Sergei Bubka, head of the IOC's athletes commission.
</P>
<P>
ASOIF and the athletes commission claim that the tests carried 
out by the Ch√¢tenay-Malabry laboratory on Armstrong's sample were 
illegal.
</P>
<P>
They also complain that the system used by the lab brings into 
doubt the whole procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"WADAs International Standard for Laboratories goes on to say 
that laboratories must use a unique internal code for each sample, 
that no information that could link an athlete with an individual 
result may be included in its reports to WADA and, in general, that 
athlete confidentiality is a key concern for all laboratories 
engaged in doping control cases.
</P>
<P>
"Confidentiality requires extra safeguards given the sensitive 
nature of these tests.
</P>
<P>
"However, in this case, the results of the analysis that have 
been done for research purposes, not even anti-doping control 
purposes, have been reported not with the internal laboratory code 
(which was not even necessary for reporting research results), but 
with the sample code!
</P>
<P>
"The results have been reported in a way so as to be able to 
identify the race, the day other samples were taken and, based on 
the doping control form containing the sample code, the identity of 
the athletes tested!
</P>
<P>
"This is simply unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"This says a lot about the complicity and the professional 
ethics of those involved.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the lab itself does not have the right to publicly 
confirm or comment upon analyses considering these were done 
illegally and their identification was made in violation of the 
guarantee of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
"These events not only cast serious doubt on the credibility of 
the French anti-doping system, but also on the entire world-wide 
anti-doping fight if such blatant transgressions are not rectified 
and those responsible properly disciplined," they complained.
</P>
<P>
Oswald and Bubka warned that athletes may be wary of competing 
in France in the future "if their due rights are so carelessly 
disregarded and there is the possibility that they too could find 
themselves facing accusations at the end of procedures to which they 
were not a party."
</P>
<P>
Pound said that although WADA did not have all the facts of the 
case there did not appear to be any ethical rules broken by the 
French laboratory.

Armstrong calls Tour director's remarks 'preposterous'

<P>
Lance Armstrong went on the offensive Wednesday, saying it was "preposterous"
for the director of the Tour de France to suggest the seven-time champion
"fooled" race officials and the sporting world by doping.
</P>
<P>
He also took to task the French newspaper that accused him, the laboratory that
released the urine samples in question and any officials of the Tour and sports
ministries involved in putting the story together.
</P>
<P>
"Where to start?" Armstrong mused during a conference call from Washington,
D.C., when asked what he found most objectionable about the controversy. "This
has been a long, love-hate relationship between myself and the
French."
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe reported Tuesday that six urine samples Armstrong provided during his
first tour win in 1999 tested positive for the red blood cell-booster EPO. On
Wednesday, tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc sounded convinced that Armstrong had
been caught.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time _ and these are no longer rumors, or insinuations, these are
proven scientific facts _ someone has shown me that in 1999, Armstrong had a
banned substance called EPO in his body," Leblanc told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is now in his court. Why, how, by whom? He owes explanations to us and
to everyone who follows the Tour. Today, what L'Equipe revealed shows me that I
was fooled. We were all fooled."
</P>
<P>
The Tour did not respond Wednesday to a request by The Associated Press to
interview Leblanc. But Armstrong said he had talked with him by
phone.
</P>
<P>
"I actually spoke to him for about 30 minutes and he didn't say any of that
stuff to me personally," Armstrong said. "But to say that I've 'fooled' the fans
is preposterous. I've been doing this a long time. We have not just one year of
only 'B' samples; we have seven years of 'A' and 'B' samples. They've all been
negative."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong questioned the validity of testing samples frozen seven years ago and
how those samples were handled since. He also charged officials at the suburban
Paris laboratory with violating World Anti-Doping Agency code for failing to
safeguard the anonymity of any remaining 'B' samples it had.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't surprise me at all that they have samples. Clearly they've tested
all of my samples since then to the highest degree. But when I gave those
samples," he said, referring to 1999, "there was not EPO in those samples. I
guarantee that."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong saved his most withering criticism for L'Equipe.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is great business for them. Unfortunately, I'm caught in the
cross-hairs."
</P>
<P>
A moment later, he added, "I think they've been planning it for a while. I think
they much would have preferred to have done this at start of the Tour, or the
middle, but for some reason, it was delayed.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of day, I think that's what it's all about ... selling
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"And," he added, "it sells."
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe, linked to the Tour de France through its parent company, has often
raised questions about Armstrong and doping. On Tuesday, the banner headline of
its four-page report was "The Armstrong Lie."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong was in Washington for a previously scheduled meeting with sponsors. He
said their support was intact and that he was considering legal action to
discover who leaked the details.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, it would cost a million and a half dollars and a year of my
life. I have a lot better things to do with the million and a half ... a lot
better things I can do with my time. Ultimately, I have to ask myself that
question."
</P>
<P>
Fellow cyclists came to Armstrong's defense Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Armstrong always told me that he never used doping products," five-time winner
Eddy Merckx told Le Monde newspaper. "Choosing between a journalist and Lance's
word, I trust Armstrong."
</P>
<P>
Five-time champion Miguel Indurain said he couldn't understand why scientists
would use samples from the '99 Tour for their tests.
</P>
<P>
"I feel the news is in bad taste and out of place, given that it happened six
years ago after his first tour victory, and after he won six more," Indurain
wrote in the Spanish sports daily Marca. "With the little I have to go on, it is
difficult to take a position, but I think at this stage there's no sense in
stirring all this up."
</P>
<P>
EPO, formally known as erythropoietin, was on the list of banned substances when
Armstrong won his first Tour, but there was no effective test to detect the
drug, which builds endurance by boosting the production of oxygen-rich red blood
cells.
</P>
<P>
The allegations took six years to surface because EPO tests on the 1999 samples
were carried out only last year, when scientists at the national doping test lab
opened them up for research to perfect EPO screening.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe's investigation was based on the second set of two samples. The first
set was used up during analysis in 1999; without it, disciplinary action against
Armstrong would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
French Sports Minister Jean-Francois Lamour said he had doubts about L'Equipe's
report because he had not seen the originals of some of the documents it
cited.
</P>
<P>
"I do not confirm it," he told RTL radio. But he added: "If what L'Equipe says
is true, I can tell you that it's a serious blow for cycling."
</P>
<P>
Jacques de Ceaurriz, the head of France's anti-doping laboratory, told Europe-1
radio that at least 15 urine samples from the 1999 Tour had tested positive for
EPO. The year before, there were more than 40 positive samples, he said _
reflecting how widespread the drug was when riders thought they could not be
caught.
</P>
<P>
The lab said it could not confirm that the positive results cited in L'Equipe
were Armstrong's. It noted that the samples were anonymous, bearing only a
six-digit number to identify the rider, and could not be matched with any one
cyclist.
</P>
<P>
However, L'Equipe said it was able to confirm the samples were Armstrong's by
matching the cyclist's medical certificates with the results of positive doping
tests bearing the same sample numbers.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong has insisted throughout his career that he has never taken drugs to
enhance his performance. In his autobiography, "It's Not About the Bike," he
said he was administered EPO during his chemotherapy treatment to battle
cancer.
</P>
<P>
"It was the only thing that kept me alive," he wrote.

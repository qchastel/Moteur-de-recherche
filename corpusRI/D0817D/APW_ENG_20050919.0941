The International Cycling Union denies accusations that its president supplied a
French sports newspaper with documents which it used to accuse Lance Armstrong
of doping at the 1999 Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the UCI said World Anti-Doping Agency chief Dick Pound was
blocking its investigation by withholding information.
</P>
<P>
Pound said last week he received a letter from UCI president Hein Verbruggen
saying he had provided L'Equipe with forms indicating Armstrong had tested
positive for EPO during his first Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Pound's transparently erroneous statements about the UCI being the source
of the forms are difficult to explain, except that they appear to be an attempt
by Mr. Pound to draw attention away from his efforts to obstruct and delay the
UCI investigation," UCI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Verbruggen has never been involved personally, contrary to what Mr. Pound
said in another statement. However, it is also apparent that the reporters were
given at least five and perhaps 15 of Lance Armstrong's doping control forms
from the 1999 Tour de France, and it is certain that those forms did not come
from the UCI."
</P>
<P>
The UCI said it was conducting an investigation at WADA's request.
</P>
<P>
"It has been three weeks ... and WADA has failed, to date, to provide all the
documents and information we have requested, which we need to conduct the
investigation, even though WADA has stated its willingness to assist the UCI,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation of the testing and the results that were published must
logically start with the laboratory and WADA and we are waiting for a response
from them to our questions."
</P>
<P>
UCI also called on WADA to either censure its chief or assign someone else to
deal with this case.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential for the WADA Board to hold Mr. Pound accountable and ... act
swiftly and definitively to establish that conduct of this type will not be
tolerated."
</P>
<P>
Last month, L'Equipe published evidence allegedly showing that six of
Armstrong's frozen urine samples from 1999 came back positive for
endurance-boosting EPO when they were retested last year.
</P>
<P>
The seven-time Tour de France champion denied ever using banned drugs, and said
he was the victim of a "witch hunt."
</P>
<P>
UCI said it had not received enough information to make a judgment on the
allegations. It also criticized L'Equipe for targeting Armstrong, and criticized
Pound for making public statements on the "likely guilt of the athlete" without
knowing all the facts.
</P>
<P>
Pound questioned the UCI's willingness to fully investigate L'Equipe's
allegations and wondered whether the cycling body was merely looking for a
"scapegoat."
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting to see whether they have a commitment to get at the truth and the
whole truth before we decide to participate further in the investigation," Pound
said at the time. "If one of the issues that the UCI wants to explore is how
some of this information became public, that's fine. But we're not prepared to
sit by and participate in an investigation that focuses only on how the
information became public."

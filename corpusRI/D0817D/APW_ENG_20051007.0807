IOC chief calls for independent inquiry in Armstrong case

<P>
IOC president Jacques Rogge called Friday for outside "independent observers" to
investigate allegations that seven-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong
tested positive for EPO at the 1999 race.
</P>
<P>
Both the International Cycling Union and the World Anti-Doping Agency have
announced separate inquiries into the case, but Rogge said he prefers a fully
independent probe.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked that an independent inquiry be started to pinpoint the different
responsibilities," Rogge said, adding he hoped "the inquiry, if possible, would
also be able to show whether the sample was positive."
</P>
<P>
In August, the French sports paper L'Equipe published documentation alleging six
of Armstrong's frozen urine samples from the 1999 Tour came back positive for
endurance-boosting EPO when they were retested last year.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong denied using banned drugs and said he was the victim of a "witch
hunt."
</P>
<P>
Rogge wants a group of "independent observers" who are linked to WADA but
operate autonomously to settle the issues if the UCI and WADA investigations
lead to different conclusions.
</P>
<P>
"If they have the same conclusion, no problem. But if they differ it would be
good to go to the independent observers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rogge questioned whether the samples belonged to Armstrong and whether they
contained EPO. He insisted Armstrong's rights had not properly been
respected.
</P>
<P>
"Armstrong still enjoys the presumption of innocence," he said in an interview
on the sidelines of a meeting with Belgian business leaders.
</P>
<P>
Rogge also said he wants to extend to all sporting federations the system of
keeping doping samples for eight years for possible retroactive sanctions. He
hopes WADA will come up with a viable procedure within the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
"It can be solved quickly," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the UCI said it had appointed Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman and his
firm to conduct an independent investigation into L'Equipe's allegations. The
cycling body said WADA's investigation was flawed because it was an "involved
party."
</P>
<P>
The leaders of WADA and UCI have been engaged in a bitter feud over the case.
Last month, WADA chief Dick Pound accused former UCI president Hein Verbruggen
of leaking documents about the alleged positive tests to L'Equipe. He also
questioned UCI's willingness to fully investigate the allegations.
</P>
<P>
UCI denied Pound's accusations and claimed he was blocking its investigation by
withholding information.
</P>
<P>
Cycling did not test for EPO until 2001. Backup "B" samples from 1999 were
frozen and tested for EPO last year. Any sanctions are unlikely because the
original "A" samples were used up and can't be verified for confirmation.

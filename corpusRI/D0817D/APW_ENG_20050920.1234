World Anti-Doping Agency chief Dick Pound denied claims by the International
Cycling Union that WADA withheld information for the probe into whether Lance
Armstrong used banned substances during the 1999 Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
"We tried to the best of our possibilities to provide the information that we
have," Pound told a news conference on Tuesday after a meeting of WADA's
executive committee.
</P>
<P>
He said he was puzzled by a request from cycling's world governing body for
information on Armstrong because WADA did not exist at the time of the alleged
doping incidents.
</P>
<P>
Pound said WADA was concerned about the "accusatory approach" by UCI, which
accused WADA of withholding information.
</P>
<P>
"We were only formed after these events took place in 1999," Pound said. "We are
unable to answer questions of what may have been on the minds of the UCI or the
lab."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the UCI denied Pound's assertion that its president Hein Verbruggen
supplied information to the French newspaper L'Equipe, which reported last month
that Armstrong's urine samples from the 1999 race contained traces of the banned
endurance-enhancing drug EPO.
</P>
<P>
The UCI urged WADA to censure Pound or assign someone else to the
case.
</P>
<P>
"I thought about sanctioning myself and decided against it," Pound
quipped.
</P>
<P>
"We're a bit nervous about the way this is going, so while we're willing to be
helpful in the context of a full investigation, we're not there to participate
in something that amounts to a search of how the information made its way in the
public domain."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong has denied ever using banned drugs, and said he was the victim of a
"witch hunt" after the article was published.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Pound said on Tuesday that FIFA was inching closer to compliance
with WADA's anti-doping code after the soccer body revised its rules to allow
WADA to appeal any FIFA rulings to the Court of Arbitration for
Sport.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement amounted to "a good decision" avoiding future public
confrontation, he said. Pound said this year FIFA risked expulsion from the
Olympics because it failed to accept two-year bans for serious doping
offenses.
</P>
<P>
WADA also announced that it approved the 2006 list of prohibited substances and
methods, which would be published before October and go into effect on Jan. 1,
2006.
</P>
<P>
WADA said in a news release that the new list was a "consolidation list and
includes only minor modifications."

SPORTS COLUMN: A COMBATIVE ARMSTRONG IS COMMITTED TO BATTLING ON
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first, it sounded like a delicious prank -- Lance Armstrong
riding again in France, just to annoy his critics. The
champion who would not go away.
</P>
<P>
In reality, it is a terrible idea. The last thing Armstrong,
the seven-time winner of the Tour de France, needs next
year is to be racing downhill in the Alps or
the Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
Now that Armstrong has taken on institutional France as the source
of the latest drug charges against him, who knows what
plastic shopping bag or stray foot might be lurking amidst
the swarms on the mountainsides?
</P>
<P>
"There are other countries in Europe," Armstrong said Tuesday, referring to
the challenging national races of Italy or Spain.
</P>
<P>
He is nothing if not combative. During the 2004 Tour, Armstrong
chased down Filippo Simeoni, an Italian cyclist who had testified
against Armstrong's adviser, Dr. Michele Ferrari, who has since been
implicated in unethical practices.
</P>
<P>
It was hardly normal for a Tour leader to intervene in
a harmless breakaway, but Armstrong had to aggress Simeoni.
</P>
<P>
Just as he was on his bicycle, Armstrong, in the first
months of retirement, is a ferocious legal competitor. Armstrong, who
has vehemently denied ever using performance-enhancing drugs, is now vowing
to pursue two cases even though they could very well
open unpleasant testimony.
</P>
<P>
"That's the way I was raised," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Armstrong is combating the Aug. 23 article in
L'Equipe, the French sports daily, that said six of his
1999 samples tested for EPO, the blood-boosting drug, appeared positive
in a recent test.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong is not about to lose any of his seven championships,
nor should he. The retroactive tests were done only on
the B urine samples that had been retained from 1999.
A subsequent article in The New York Times revealed a
collegial controversy among scientists about the current test for EPO.
The release of this data, whether accurate or not, violates
all standards of confidentiality and control that should govern drug
testing.
</P>
<P>
The International Cycling Union, known as UCI, which has belatedly ratcheted
up its testing process in recent years, appeared to shrug
off the charges last week, lacking further proof.
</P>
<P>
"The question is not about me but about the process and
the ethics," Armstrong said Tuesday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
There are, however, enough claims and rumors and old enemies and
circumstantial evidence going around to do continued harm to Armstrong's
image in his home country -- the cancer survivor who
won the Tour seven times and has built a foundation
to fight the disease that almost killed him. He is
battling for his reputation as he often attacked a competitor
on the slopes of France.
</P>
<P>
"You do 'Larry King Live,"' Armstrong said Tuesday, citing one Internet
poll that showed 87 percent of the people believed him
-- "stateside." Still, doubts have been raised.
</P>
<P>
A trial, scheduled for High Court in London on Nov. 6
involves his suit concerning excerpts from the book "L.A. Confidentiel:
Les Secrets de Lance Armstrong," published in The Sunday Times
of London in 2004.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to it," Armstrong said. "You sit there and
tell your side of it."
</P>
<P>
It is likely that some people critical of Armstrong in the
book will be testifying. "There will be cross-examination," Armstrong said.
"My lawyers tell me they do this all the time."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong might be liable for court costs, which could amount to
more than $1 million, if he dropped the Sunday Times
suit. "But Lance feels he was defamed by The Sunday
Times," Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's agent, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The book contains voluminous allusions to drug use in cycling that
resulted in the deaths of dozens of young riders, plus
various scandals and suspensions. So far it has been published
only in French.
</P>
<P>
The other impending legal case involves Armstrong's suit to claim the
$5 million bonus for winning his sixth consecutive Tour in
2004, as guaranteed by an insurance company, SCA Promotions, in
Texas. SCA has cited the book and other doubts as
a reason for not paying.
</P>
<P>
"That's a question of Texas contract law," Armstrong said. "What's the
deal? Pay the money."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong concedes that the L'Equipe charges may be raised in some
of his legal cases. The paper is owned by the
same corporation that runs the Tour de France, which made
millions of dollars from American tourism and corporate involvement during
the Armstrong years. When Armstrong retired, the 1999 B samples
somehow materialized at L'Equipe.
</P>
<P>
Stapleton and Armstrong have been highly critical of Richard W. Pound,
the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency, for calling for
further investigation of the 1999 tests. They say the B
samples should never have been released and are unreliable, six
years later, given the upgraded testing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"EPO is a powerful drug," Armstrong said Tuesday. "Some say it
makes you 10 percent faster. Let's say I took EPO
in 1999 and didn't take it from 2000 to 2005.
My performance never dropped off. Obviously, I'm not saying I
did. But I only got faster."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said there are "many factors" for his being investigated in
France, including the loss of dominance by French riders in
the past two decades. He has generally been well received
by French cycling fans by the side of the road,
however, and claiming French anti-Americanism is not fair.
</P>
<P>
Many Europeans assume that cyclists rely on chemicals in one form
or another. American sports fans are only now developing their
cynical side after recent developments in baseball.
</P>
<P>
It appears that Armstrong has a large tiger by the tail,
in what he had depicted as a placid retirement. Since
his last ride up the Champs-Elysees, on July 24, Armstrong
has proposed to his girlfriend, Sheryl Crow, spent time with
his three children, and, through the Lance Armstrong Foundation, donated
$500,000 to cancer victims uprooted by Hurricane Katrina.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, he has appeared at a testimonial to his
blocking back, George Hincapie, in South Carolina on Saturday; rooted
for his peer, Andre Agassi, at the U.S. Open in
New York on Sunday; then jetted out to Sun Valley,
Idaho, to cycle with his pal Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
Mostly, Lance Armstrong's retirement sounds much like his racing career. People
pursue him. He pursues people.

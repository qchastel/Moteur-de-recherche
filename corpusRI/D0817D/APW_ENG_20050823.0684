French sports daily L'Equipe reported Tuesday that Lance Armstrong used the
performance-enhancing drug EPO to help win his first Tour de France in 1999, a
report the seven-time Tour winner vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe devoted four pages to its allegations, with the front-page headline
"The Armstrong Lie." The paper said that signs of EPO use showed up in
Armstrong's urine six times during the '99 race.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the witch hunt continues and tomorrow's article is nothing short
of tabloid journalism," Armstrong wrote on his Web site. "I will simply restate
what I have said many times: I have never taken performance-enhancing
drugs."
</P>
<P>
However, Tour de France director Jean-Marie Leblanc said Tuesday that L'Equipe's
report seemed "very complete, very professional, very meticulous" and that it
"appears credible."
</P>
<P>
"We are very shocked, very troubled by the revelations we read this morning,"
Leblanc told RTL radio. He cautioned that Armstrong, his doctors and his aides
should be heard out before people make any final judgment.
</P>
<P>
Leblanc also said any disciplinary action appeared unlikely, based on the
L'Equipe account. The paper's investigation was based solely on B samples _ the
second of two samples used in doping tests. The A samples were used in 1999 for
analysis at the time.
</P>
<P>
The governing body of world cycling did not begin using a urine test for EPO
until 2001. For years, it had been impossible to detect the drug, called
erythropoietin, which builds endurance by boosting the production of oxygen-rich
red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
EPO tests on the 1999 B urine samples were not carried out until last year, when
scientists performed research on them to fine-tune EPO testing methods, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The national anti-doping laboratory in Chatenay-Malabry, which developed the EPO
test and analyzed the urine samples in question, said it could not confirm that
the positive EPO results were Armstrong's.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the samples were anonymous, bearing only a a six-digit number to
identify the rider, and could not be matched with the name of any one
cyclist.
</P>
<P>
However, L'Equipe said it was able to make the match. It printed photos of what
it said were official doping documents. On one side of the page, it showed what
it said were the results of EPO tests from anonymous riders used for lab
research. On the other, it showed Armstrong's medical certificates, signed by
doctors and riders after doping tests _ and bearing the same identifying number
printed on the results.
</P>
<P>
The lab statement said it had promised to turn over its results to the World
Anti-Doping Agency "on condition that they could not be used in any disciplinary
proceeding."
</P>
<P>
"It will be very interesting to see what UCI does and what the U.S. Cycling
Federation does and what Lance Armstrong has to say," WADA chairman Dick Pound
said. "If the evidence is seen as credible than yes, he has an obligation to
come forward and specifically give his comments, especially after his previous
comments that he has never used drugs.
</P>
<P>
"If anything were found, we couldn't do anything because we didn't even exist in
1999. But it's important that the truth must always be made clear," Pound
added.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe, whose parent company is closely linked to the Tour, has frequently
raised questions about how Armstrong could have made his spectacular comeback
from testicular cancer without using performance enhancers. L'Equipe is owned by
the Amaury Group whose subsidiary, Amaury Sport Organization, organizes the Tour
de France and other sporting events.
</P>
<P>
A former L'Equipe journalist, Pierre Ballester, was co-author of a book
published last year that contained doping allegations against Armstrong. He
wrote the book with The Sunday Times sportswriter David Walsh.
</P>
<P>
In the book, "L.A. Confidential, the Secrets of Lance Armstrong," one of the
cyclist's former assistants claimed that Armstrong once asked her to dispose of
used syringes and give him makeup to conceal needle marks on his
arms.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong has taken libel action against The Sunday Times after the British
newspaper reprinted allegations in a review of the book in June 2004. The case
will go to trial in London's High Court in November.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong retired from cycling after his record seventh straight Tour victory
last month.

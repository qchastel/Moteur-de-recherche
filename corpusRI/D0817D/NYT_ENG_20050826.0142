TEXAS SCIENTIST DEFENDS ARMSTRONG

<P>
A University of Texas scientist is coming to
the defense of Lance Armstrong amid allegations that the Tour
de France champion used a banned substance to help him
win in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ed Coyle, director of UT's Human Performance Laboratory, studied the physiology
of Armstrong from 1992 to 1999. He said Thursday that
Armstrong's record victory streak and the edge he has on
other cyclists can be explained by science and not the
taking of erythropoietin, or EPO, the blood booster reportedly found
in his urine samples from 1999.
</P>
<P>
Coyle, a nutritional adviser to the International Olympic Committee and a
former editor of the International Journal of Sports Medicine, concluded
that the cycling champion showed an 18 percent improvement during
the seven years he studied Armstrong by significantly increasing his
slow-twitch muscle fibers, losing body mass and taking a modern
approach to a sport that embraces obsolete training ideas.
</P>
<P>
"Again, before searching for explanations in conspiracy and cheating, you should
first look at human nature for signs of ignorance and
difficulty with change," Coyle said via e-mail Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this summer, Coyle published his observations of Armstrong in the
June edition of "The Journal of Applied Physiology." European reporters
have searched out Coyle this week to comment on the
report in the Paris newspaper L'Equipe that alleged Armstrong tested
positive for EPO six times in 1999. The newspaper reported
that a laboratory outside Paris had tested the frozen Tour
de France urine samples and that documents link six of
the positive tests to Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong took the offensive after the stories were published, stating that
in 1999 "when I gave those samples, there was not
EPO in those samples. I guarantee that."
</P>
<P>
The samples tested were all B, or backup, specimens. The A
tests were discarded after testing in 1999. There is now
nothing left to retest.
</P>
<P>
"They've put Lance in Pandora's Box," said Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's attorney.
"And he can't defend himself."
</P>
<P>
Coyle said none of the physiological changes that led to Armstrong's
seven victories could be linked to a use of an
illegal chemical. EPO is a drug legally prescribed for patients
with kidney problems and those undergoing chemotherapy. The substance helps
build oxygen-carrying red blood cells. Cyclists and cross-country skiers have
illegally used EPO to better endurance, but Coyle estimated that
taking the drug gives someone only a 3 percent to
5 percent improvement in performance.
</P>
<P>
Cyclists who use EPO inject the drug during training and not
during racing, which is why the World Anti Doping Agency
has been focusing so much attention on out-of-competition testing.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong told the Austin American-Statesman on Thursday that he has donated
"close to six figures" of his own salary to the
international cycling federation for the specific use of bettering a
test for EPO.
</P>
<P>
He was the focus of six out -of-competition tests earlier this
year, he said. Armstrong estimated that he's been tested at
least 300 times in his seven-year winning streak.
</P>
<P>
"We have seven years of 'A' and 'B' samples," Armstrong said.
"They've all been negative."
</P>
<P>
During Coyle's seven-year study, Armstrong dropped 15 pounds and trained hard
enough to increase the percentage of slow-twitch muscle fibers in
his body from 60 percent to 80 percent. Typically, the
best endurance athletes are naturally blessed with more slow-twitch fibers,
which need less energy to function at a high level
for long periods of time. Most cyclists are in the
60 percent range while non-athletes are between 40 and 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
"I'm certain these improvements have nothing to do with blood or
EPO, but are due simply to seven years of training
and a modest diet in the spring months before the
Tour de France," Coyle said.
</P>
<P>
Coyle also said Armstrong's two main rivals -- Germany's Jan Ullrich
and Italy's Ivan Basso -- do not come into the
Tour with the same conditioning as Armstrong. Ullrich, the 1997
champion, usually comes into the Tour overweight and is at
his best in the race's final week. Basso, who finished
second to Armstrong this July, rode the three-week Giro d'Italia
in May, which may have sapped his strength.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm saying is that Armstrong's European competitors are beating themselves
by entering the race tired and unprepared to climb," Coyle
said.

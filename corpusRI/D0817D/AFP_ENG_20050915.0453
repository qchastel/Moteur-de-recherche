<P>
WADA boss Dick Pound has claimed UCI 
head Hein Verbruggen tipped off L'Equipe in the Armstrong doping 
case.
</P>
<P>
Pound told a press conference in Montreal on Thursday that it 
was Verbruggen who had given information about Armstrong to the 
French daily, which reported on August 23 that urine samples from 
Armstrong's first of seven Tour de France wins in 1999 contained 
traces of banned blood-boosting drug EPO.
</P>
<P>
When asked if Verbruggen had given information to French daily 
L'Equipe, Pound said: "Yes. He at least has shown all six (doping 
test forms signed by Armstrong) to the journalist and he gave the 
journalist at least one copy."
</P>
<P>
Since the fall-out from the allegations, Verbruggen has never 
publicly pointed the finger at the American.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong has continually denied he took performance-enhancing 
substances and pointed out proper procedures had not been followed 
and no B sample was provided.

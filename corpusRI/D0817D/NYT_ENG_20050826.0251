TOP U.S. CYCLING GROUP STANDING BY ARMSTRONG
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of USA Cycling defended Lance Armstrong on Friday, saying
that new doping charges were unfair and lacked credibility.
</P>
<P>
The French newspaper L'Equipe reported Tuesday that traces of the performance-enhancing
drug EPO had been found in frozen samples of Armstrong's
urine from 1999, the year he won the first of
seven Tour de France titles.
</P>
<P>
But Gerard Bisceglia, the chief executive of USA Cycling, said the
report was flawed because it was based on the testing
of only B samples of Armstrong's urine. The A samples,
which were destroyed in 1999, also must be tested for
a valid result, Bisceglia said.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance is there are protocols and procedures that are well
defined and laid out in the WADA, USADA codes," he
said in a telephone interview, referring to the World Anti-Doping
Agency and the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. "We religiously adhere to
those policies.
</P>
<P>
"We are adamantly against doping in the sport. We also have
a responsibility and obligation to look out for the rights
of our riders and members. In this particular case, our
rider has been denied due process."
</P>
<P>
Bisceglia said he decided to speak out after reading statements from
officials of the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Tour de
France who supported the L'Equipe report.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe quoted the Tour de France director, Jean-Marie Leblanc, as saying,
"For the first time -- and these are no longer
rumors, or insinuations, these are proven scientific facts -- someone
has shown me that in 1999, Armstrong had a banned
substance called EPO in his body."
</P>
<P>
According to The Associated Press, Dick Pound, the head of the
World Anti-Doping Agency, said the lab that recorded the positive
tests was accredited by the International Olympic Committee. L'Equipe reported
that the samples belonged to Armstrong, a claim the lab
would not confirm.
</P>
<P>
"You can count on the fingers of one hand the times
a B sample has not confirmed the result of the
A sample," Pound was quoted as saying. "It's almost always
a delaying tactic."
</P>
<P>
Bisceglia said his main complaint was that Armstrong would not have
the opportunity to prove his innocence because of the absence
of an A sample.
</P>
<P>
"When people start using comments like, 'irrefutable scientific evidence,' that's a
pretty strong statement to make," Bisceglia said, "when the person
you're making it about has never been given the opportunity
to refute the statement.
</P>
<P>
"You're making claims about something that took place in 1999. Based
on what I've read, it's pretty clear that any opportunity
to have a black-and-white resolution to this case has been
destroyed."
</P>
<P>
Bisceglia said USA Cycling, the governing body for the sport in
the United States, would not look into the L'Equipe report.
Typically, the organization takes action in doping cases only when
guilt has been proven, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is going to become anything more than
a news story," Bisceglia said.

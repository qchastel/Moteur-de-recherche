FRENCH NEWSPAPER SAYS ARMSTRONG USED ILLEGAL DRUGS LYNN ZINSER AND LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN CONTRIBUTED REPORTING FROM NEW YORK

<P>
The French sports newspaper L'Equipe charged Tuesday that Lance
Armstrong used an illegal performance-enhancing drug in 1999 to win
his first of seven consecutive Tours.
</P>
<P>
"Lance Armstrong has used EPO," the banned erythropoietin, to increase the
red blood corpuscles that carry oxygen to muscles, the newspaper
stated in a four-page report that began with a front-page
headline, "The Armstrong Lie."
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Armstrong, who retired on July 24 after his latest
victory, strongly denied the charge. But Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director
of the Tour de France, called the newspaper's report "very
complete, very professional, very meticulous." He said on RTL radio
that the charge "appears credible." Leblanc added that disciplinary action
seemed unlikely since the tests were based on only the
second, or B, urine sample taken during the race. The
A sample was tested in 1999 but was not frozen.
</P>
<P>
No tests for EPO were available in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong has been under suspicion and investigated a handful of times
since his comeback in 1999 from testicular cancer, but has
never been found guilty of doping.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the witch hunt continues," he said on his Web site,
adding that the "article is nothing short of tabloid journalism."
He added, "I will simply restate what I have said
many times: I have never taken performance-enhancing drugs."
</P>
<P>
The tests were done at the Chatenay-Malabry laboratory outside Paris last
year, the specialist doping facility confirmed. The urine samples were
tested in 2004 to help scientists refine EPO detection methods,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The lab confirmed that it had conducted the tests, but said
it could not confirm that the samples were Armstrong's because
the labels were identified only by six-digit labels.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe said it had decoded the labels by matching each sample
with forms filed with the French Cycling Federation during the
tour. Those forms, filled out each time a sample was
taken in a drug test, identified the donor by name
as well as the six digits on his urine sample.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe reproduced both what it said were the results of the
laboratory's tests, with sample number, and the forms with the
same number and Armstrong's name. L'Equipe, which said it conducted
"a long, painstaking and rigorous investigation," reproduced what it said
were EPO tests of frozen urine samples taken from riders
during the 1999 Tour.
</P>
<P>
Doctors commonly store blood, urine and other samples so they can
do tests that may become necessary or available years after
the samples were taken. They usually compare those tests with
control samples to make sure that freezing or other storage
techniques do not distort the findings. In a drug test,
for example, they might compare a suspect sample of stored
blood with one that contained no drugs. Six samples that
the paper said were taken from Armstrong proved positive for
the "indisputable" use of EPO, the paper said. It added
that six other samples from riders who were not identified
had also proven positive. "It cannot be regarded as a
positive test in the strict regulatory sense," the newspaper said,
doubting that French sanctions were likely.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe said the World Antidoping Agency or the U.S. Antidoping Agency
could act, but that appears unlikely even if the charges
were further substantiated. French sports minister Jean-Francois Lamour told the
Associated Press that because the A sample was disposed of
after the initial 1999 testing, the B sample would not
be enough to pursue charges and punishment.
</P>
<P>
The sample also pre-dates the formation of the World Anti-Doping Agency,
which was launched in 2000 to administer Olympic drug testing
worldwide, as well as the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, also started
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"If anything were found, we couldn't do anything because we didn't
even exist in 1999," said the WADA chairman, Richard Pound.
Still, Pound encouraged the International and U.S. cycling federations to
look into the allegations, saying, "it's important that the truth
must always be made clear."
</P>
<P>
Clarity, though, may be illusive. There was no worldwide standard on
freezing samples until 2004, when the WADA code was adopted
by most countries to govern such matters. And the reliability
of the urine test for EPO, first used in 2000,
has been a source of concern.
</P>
<P>
USA Cycling spokesman Andy Lee said the organization would have no
comment.
</P>
<P>
As he continued to win the Tour de France year in
and year out, Armstrong has occasionally been the target of
doping suspicions in L'Equipe, which is owned by the same
company that owns the Tour de France --- the Amaury
Sports Organisation - and works out of the same building.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Indurain of Spain, who won the Tour five times in
the 1990s, was quoted on the Web site todociciclismo.com on
Tuesday as saying, "They have been out to get him
in France for a number of years."
</P>
<P>
The continuing suspicions have embroiled Armstrong in at least four court
suits that are still to be heard. In what seems
to be the biggest one, he is suing The Sunday
Times of London for reprinting doping charges made in a
book, "L.A. Confidential, the Secrets of Lance Armstrong," in 2004.
The other cases involve an Italian rider, a former personal
assistant who, like Armstrong, is a Texan, and an American
insurance company that has refused to pay a bonus of
several million dollars to the rider because of its doubts
about his Tour victory two years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the month since he retired, Armstrong has been spending his
time with his three children, with his companion, the singer
Sheryl Crow, and with work for his foundation to combat
cancer. On Saturday, he visited President Bush's ranch and rode
with him on mountain bikes across the Texas landscape. Armstrong
is a member of the President's Council on Cancer and
has pressed him for more research funds.

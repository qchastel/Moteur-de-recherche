Notes by the New York Times' Judith Miller that were turned over in a criminal
investigation contain the name of a covert CIA officer, but the reporter has
told prosecutors she cannot recall who disclosed the name, the newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor in the case asked Miller in recent days to explain how Valerie
Plame _ misspelled in those notes as "Valerie Flame" _ appeared in the same
notebook the reporter used in interviewing her confidential source, Vice
President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, according to the Times.
</P>
<P>
In response to questioning by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, Miller replied
that she "didn't think" she heard Plame's name from Cheney's aide, I. Lewis
"Scooter" Libby.
</P>
<P>
"I said I believed the information came from another source, whom I could not
recall," Miller wrote, recounting her testimony for an article that the
newspaper posted on its Web site Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Valerie Flame" actually was the name in the notebook, and the Times said Miller
should have written Valerie Plame.

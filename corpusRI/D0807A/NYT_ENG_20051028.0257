CHENEY AIDE INDICTED; LIBBY RESIGNS OVER PERJURY CHARGES IN CIA LEAK
CASE; ROVE PROBE GOES ON FACES CHARGES OF PERJURY, OBSTRUCTION
IN CIA LEAK INVESTIGATION FACES CHARGES OF PERJURY, MAKING FALSE
STATEMENTS, OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE WASHINGTON - I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby,
Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, was indicted Friday
on charges of perjury, making false statements, and obstruction of
justice in the investigation into the leaked name of a
CIA operative. In a potentially damaging sign for the Bush
administration, special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald said that although his investigation
is nearly complete, "It's not over."
</P>
<P>
Libby, 55, one of the administration's most influential advisers in the
decision to invade Iraq, resigned immediately upon being informed of
his indictment.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald, after refusing for months to speak to the press, forcefully
defended his decision to indict Libby.
</P>
<P>
"When a vice president's chief of staff is charged with perjury
and obstruction of justice, it does show the world that
this is a country that takes its law seriously, that
all citizens are bound by the law," Fitzgerald said at
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Karl Rove, President Bush's deputy chief of staff and close political
adviser, was not indicted but still faced the possibility of
prosecution. Fitzgerald said that his investigation was still ongoing.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Rove was "off the hook," Fitzgerald responded: "I'm not
going to comment on any one name."
</P>
<P>
The Libby indictment is the latest in a series of problems
for President Bush, who has suffered from low approval ratings
and who on Thursday withdrew the troubled Supreme Court nomination
of his counsel, Harriet Miers. In a terse comment to
reporters Friday, Bush said he accepted Libby's resignation and called
the charges "serious." But he cautioned that Libby must be
"presumed innocent and entitled to due process."
</P>
<P>
Libby said in a statement that it was a "sad day"
but he was "confident that at the end of this
process I will be completely and totally exonerated."
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all five charges, Libby could receive a maximum
of 30 years in prison and a $1.25 million fine.
</P>
<P>
Cheney issued a statement saying he accepted Libby's resignation "with deep
regret."
</P>
<P>
"Scooter Libby is one of the most capable and talented individuals
I have ever known," Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
Cheney, and perhaps Bush, might be called to testify at Libby's
trial, in a case that could examine the way White
House officials sought to rebut criticism of the decision to
go to war.
</P>
<P>
The 22-page indictment of Libby lays out how Cheney's closest adviser
allegedly lied to the grand jury about his discussions with
reporters about the identity of Valerie Plame Wilson. Libby told
the grand jury that he learned of her employment at
the CIA from reporters. But the indictment said he learned
about Plame's job from Cheney, an unnamed senior CIA official,
an unnamed CIA briefer, an unnamed "senior White House official,"
and an unnamed undersecretary of state.
</P>
<P>
One of the key questions left unanswered by the indictment is
whether Cheney played any role in leaking Plame's identity. At
the press conference, Fitzgerald declined to respond to any questions
about Cheney's role, saying, "I'm not making allegations about anyone
not charged in the indictment."
</P>
<P>
Like past Washington scandals, the indictment gave new life to the
adage that "it's not the crime, it's the cover-up."
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald's investigation initially focused on whether there was a violation of
a 1982 law that prohibits government officials from knowingly releasing
the name of a covert agent. But Fitzgerald did not
bring charges on that statute, which is considered difficult to
prosecute because of the need to prove intent.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Fitzgerald brought five charges: that Libby twice lied to FBI
agents about his role in discussing Plame with reporters; twice
committed perjury in speaking about his actions to the grand
jury; and obstructed justice by trying to impede the grand
jury's investigation through his pattern of lies and obfuscations.
</P>
<P>
Valerie Plame Wilson is the wife of Joseph Wilson, a former
US ambassador with experience in Africa. In 2002, Cheney's office
asked the CIA to investigate claims that Iraq was trying
to acquire material for nuclear weapons from Niger. The CIA
sent Joseph Wilson, who reported back to the CIA that
he doubted the claim that Iraq was seeking a material
known as yellowcake from Niger. Nonetheless, Bush said in his
January 2003 State of the Union speech that British intelligence
had found that Iraq was seeking materials from Africa.
</P>
<P>
Starting in May 2003, Joseph Wilson became the anonymous source of
stories about his doubts that Iraq had sought nuclear materials
from Niger and the White House quickly determined that he
was the source. That, in turn, led Libby to ask
government officials about Joseph Wilson and to determine whether his
wife, who worked at the CIA, suggested that the agency
send him to investigate Cheney's questions about Niger.
</P>
<P>
The indictment says that Libby learned about Valerie Plame Wilson's identity
from Cheney in June 2003, contradicting Libby's assertion to the
grand jury that he learned about her from reporters. "Libby
learned from the Vice President that Wilson's wife worked for
the CIA in the Counterproliferation division," the indictment says.
</P>
<P>
On or around June 11, 2003, Libby was told by an
unidentified CIA official "that Wilson's wife was employed by the
CIA and that the idea of sending him to Niger
originated with her," according to the indictment. The following day,
Libby was told by an unnamed undersecretary of state that
Plame worked for the CIA. Two days later, Libby discussed
both Wilsons with his CIA briefer, the indictment says.
</P>
<P>
The White House's interest in Valerie Plame Wilson intensified when her
husband went public with his doubts in a New York
Times op-ed piece in July in which he said that
the Bush administration twisted evidence about Iraq's effort to acquire
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The indictment laid out the chronology of Libby's knowledge about Valerie
Plame Wilson in an effort to show that he lied
about that knowledge when he spoke to the FBI and
the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
For example, the indictment says that Libby testified before that grand
jury that he learned around July 10, 2003 about Valerie
Plame Wilson from Tim Russert, the moderator of NBC-TV's "Meet
The Press." Libby testified that Russert asked if he knew
that Valerie Plame Wilson worked for the CIA. Libby testified
that he was surprised to hear that she worked for
the CIA, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
The indictment says this was a false statement because "Libby was
well aware that Wilson's wife worked at the CIA and
Libby had participated in multiple prior conversations concerning this topic."
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Libby testified that he told Matthew Cooper of Time magazine
on or about July 12, 2003 that he had heard
that reporters were saying Wilson's wife worked for the CIA.
The indictment said this was a false statement and that
Libby instead "confirmed to Cooper, without qualification, that Libby had
heard that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA."
</P>
<P>
And, the indictment says, Libby testified that he told Judith Miller
of The New York Times on or about July 12,
2003 that he had heard that reporters were saying Valerie
Plame Wilson worked for the CIA but that he did
not know if it was true. The indictment said this,
too, was a false statement because Libby did not provide
such a statement to Miller.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who spent 85 days in jail before acknowledging that Libby
was her source, and who never wrote about the Wilsons,
has said that she discussed Valerie Plame Wilson with Libby
but could not say who first told her about Wilson.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wilson, addressing the administration's motive in leaking his wife's CIA
job, said in a statement released Friday, "I feel that
my family was a acked for my speaking the truth
about the events that led our country to war."
</P>
<P>
The indictment provides some clues about unanswered questions in the case.
The indictment says that Libby told then-White House press secretary
Ari Fleischer around July 7, 2003 that Valerie Plame Wilson
worked at the CIA "and noted that such information was
not widely known." But the indictment does not say what
Fleischer did with that information.
</P>
<P>
The indictment also says that Libby spoke to a senior White
House aide identified only as "Official A" around July 10,
2003, and that this official had previously spoken about Valerie
Plame Wilson with columnist Robert Novak. It was Novak's July
14, 2003 column that revealed her identity and set the
investigation in motion. Novak has never revealed the names of
his two sources for that column.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted sources as saying Rove was "Official A."
</P>
<P>
Friday, Rove's lawyer, Robert Luskin, said in a statement that Rove
was cooperating with the investigation, adding, "We are confident that
when the special counsel finishes his work, he will conclude
that Mr. Rove has done nothing wrong."
</P>
<P>
The special counsel, Fitzgerald, said the term of the grand jury
has expired, but he stressed that, "It's an ordinary course
to keep a grand jury open to consider other matters,
and that's what we will be doing."
</P>
<P>
He would not comment on whether further indictments would be brought.
</P>
<P>
"We're not quite done," Fitzgerald said. "But I don't want to
... add to a feverish pitch. You know, it's very,
very routine that you keep a grand jury available for
what you might need. And that's all I can say
because of the rules of grand jury secrecy."

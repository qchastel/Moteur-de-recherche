SENATOR ASKS BUSH TO REVEAL SOURCE OF CIA LEAK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on President Bush Wednesday
to reveal who leaked the name of a CIA operative
to the press after reports that columnist Robert Novak said
he is "confident the president knows who the source is."
</P>
<P>
A special prosecutor has been probing whether administration officials leaked the
name of CIA agent Valerie Plame to Novak and others
in an organized effort to retaliate against her husband, administration
critic Joseph Wilson. As a covert officer, Plame is protected
under a statute that makes it a crime under certain
circumstances to reveal her identity.
</P>
<P>
"In keeping with your stated desire to root out leaks, I
urge you to share with the American people whatever knowledge
you have about which senior administration officials were responsible for
disclosing Ms. Plame's identity as a CIA operative," Schumer wrote
Bush in a letter.
</P>
<P>
The White House would not discuss the letter, saying its policy
is to not comment on the leak while it is
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The investigation has led to the indictment of Vice President Dick
Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, on
charges of perjury, making false statements and obstructing justice in
the case. Libby pleaded not guilty, setting the stage for
a high-profile trial.
</P>
<P>
Bush's closest political adviser, Karl Rove, is still under investigation in
the matter and has testified four times before a federal
grand jury. White House officials flatly denied two years ago
that he and Libby had any involvement in outing the
identity of Plame.
</P>
<P>
Novak first identified Plame as a CIA operative in a newspaper
column on July 14, 2003, attributing the information to administration
officials. Eight days earlier, Wilson had written an opinion piece
in The New York Times that suggested that the administration
manipulated intelligence on the Iraqi weapons program to justify going
to war.
</P>
<P>
Novak has never revealed his sources publicly.
</P>
<P>
According to the Raleigh News and Observer, Novak on Tuesday told
a luncheon sponsored by the John Locke Foundation, a conservative
think tank, "I'm confident the president knows who the source
is... I'd be amazed if he doesn't."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, "Don't bug me...Bug the president as to
whether he should reveal who the source is."
</P>
<P>
Novak also said his role in the Plame affair "snowballed out
of proportion" as a result of a "campaign by the
left."
</P>
<P>
But he also blamed "extremely bad management of the issue by
the White House."
</P>
<P>
"Once you give an issue to a special prosecutor, you lose
control of it," he said, according to the newspaper.

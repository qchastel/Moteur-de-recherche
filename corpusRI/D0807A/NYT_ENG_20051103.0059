LIBBY PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO CHARGES RELATED TO CIA LEAK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I. Lewis Libby Jr., Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of
staff, pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges that he lied
about disclosing classified information.
</P>
<P>
Libby, 55, resigned as Cheney's top aide last week after he
was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that
he lied about his role in the leaking of the
name of an undercover CIA agent to journalists.
</P>
<P>
Libby entered the plea in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge
Reggie B. Walton, an appointee of President Bush.
</P>
<P>
The grand jury indicted Libby, after a nearly two-year investigation, on
charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and making false statements.
The five-count indictment charges that Libby lied to FBI agents
and to the grand jury about how -- and when
-- he came to learn classified information about a CIA
operative, Valerie Plame. If convicted on each count, Libby faces
up to 30 years in prison and a $1.25 million
fine.
</P>
<P>
Libby has acknowledged speaking to reporters about Plame, but has denied
that he revealed that she was an undercover operative, which
could be a violation of federal law.
</P>
<P>
The grand jury did not indict Karl Rove, President Bush's top
political strategist, who had also become entangled in the investigation.
However, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the special counsel in the case,
said in announcing the indictment of Libby last week that
the probe is "not over."
</P>
<P>
After his indictment last week, Libby issued a statement saying he
expected to be "totally exonerated."
</P>
<P>
The five charges relate to Libby's testimony to the grand jury,
and statements he made to authorities regarding discussions he had
with Tim Russert of NBC News, Judith Miller of The
New York Times, and Matthew Cooper of Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said during a news conference last week that Libby had
at least seven conversations with various government officials about Plame
before he claimed to have learned her identity from Russert.
The special counsel said Libby and Russert had, in fact,
never discussed Plame.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, what appears is that Libby's
story that he was at the tail end of a
chain of phone calls, passing on from one reporter what
he heard from another, was not true," Fitzgerald said during
the news conference. "It was false. He was at the
beginning of the chain of phone calls, the first official
to disclose this information outside the government to a reporter.
And then he lied about it afterwards, under oath, and
repeatedly."
</P>
<P>
While the federal investigation had originally centered on who had leaked
the name of Plame, no one has been charged with
violating a 1982 federal law that prohibits revealing the identity
of covert operatives.
</P>
<P>
Plame is married to Joseph C. Wilson IV, a former ambassador,
who criticized the Bush administration's stated reasons for going to
war in Iraq. In 2002, Wilson traveled to Niger at
the behest of the CIA to investigate whether the African
nation had been discussing supplying uranium to Saddam Hussein so
that Iraq could develop nuclear weapons. Wilson, who said he
found no evidence of such an effort, later challenged a
statement made by President Bush about Iraqi attempts to obtain
uranium yellowcake from Niger.
</P>
<P>
Wilson has said that Bush administration officials revealed the identity of
his wife to the reporters as a way of retaliating
against him.

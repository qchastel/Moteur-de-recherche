Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald is disputing the claim of Vice President Dick
Cheney's former top aide that the prosecutor lacked the legal authority to
indict him in the CIA leak investigation.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald opposed the request by I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby that a judge dismiss
the five-count indictment against him in the Valerie Plame affair. In court
papers, the prosecutor argued that being allowed to operate outside any control
of the U.S. Justice Department is constitutional and in accordance with federal
law.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, investigating the disclosure of Plame's CIA undercover status,
is not supervised by the Justice Department and he is not required to inform
anyone at the department about the investigation's progress.
</P>
<P>
In a court filing in February, Libby said that only Congress could approve such
an arrangement.
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general may delegate powers, but he may not abdicate
responsibility," Libby's lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald replied that the attorney general has been granted broad legal
authority by Congress "to delegate any of his functions to other offices of the
Department of Justice."
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald is the U.S. attorney in Chicago. He was appointed in December 2003 by
then-Deputy Attorney General James Comey. John Ashcroft, the attorney general at
the time, disqualified himself from the matter because of potential conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald obtained an indictment of Libby on five counts of perjury,
obstruction and lying to the FBI.

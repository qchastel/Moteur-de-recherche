CHENEY AIDE RESIGNS, FACES 5 COUNTS IN CIA IDENTITY LEAK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of
staff and a key architect of the Iraq war, was
indicted Friday on felony charges of perjury, making false statements
to FBI agents and obstruction of justice for impeding the
federal grand jury investigating the CIA leak case.
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of the indictment Friday afternoon, Libby resigned.
</P>
<P>
Karl Rove, President Bush's senior adviser and deputy chief of staff,
was not charged with any crime in the case, but
his lawyers indicated that he still could be a target
of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The five-count indictment alleges that Libby lied to FBI agents on
two occasions, perjured himself during two appearances before the grand
jury and obstructed justice when he "knowingly and corruptly endeavored
to influence, obstruct and impede" the grand jury's efforts to
find out who leaked Valerie Plame's status as a CIA
covert agent to reporters in the spring of 2003.
</P>
<P>
The charges carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison
and a $1.25 million fine, although legal experts say it's
unlikely Libby would face such a severe penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald said that even though Libby was not
charged with violating the federal Intelligence Identities Protection Act of
1982 -- which makes it a crime to disclose the
identity of intelligence agents working undercover -- the charges against
Libby were significant.
</P>
<P>
"The need to get to the bottom of what happened, and
whether national security was compromised by inadvertence, by recklessness, by
maliciousness is extremely important," Fitzgerald said at a packed news
conference at the Justice Department in Washington, D.C. "We need
to know the truth. And anyone who would go into
a grand jury and lie and obstruct and impede the
investigation has committed a serious crime."
</P>
<P>
Libby, in a statement, said he planned to fight the charges.
</P>
<P>
"I have conducted my responsibilities honorably and truthfully, including with respect
to this investigation," Libby said. "It is with deep regret
that I step aside from that service today. I am
confident that at the end of this process I will
be completely and totally exonerated."
</P>
<P>
The indictment shook the White House, which was already reeling from
the withdrawal of Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers a day
earlier. Bush flew back from a speech in Norfolk, Va.,
to appear on the White House's South Lawn to address
the charges against Libby.
</P>
<P>
"Today I accepted the resignation of Scooter Libby," Bush said. "Scooter
has worked tirelessly on behalf of the American people and
sacrificed much in the service to this country."
</P>
<P>
The president called the charges by the grand jury "serious," but
he added, "each individual is presumed innocent and entitled to
due process and a fair trial."
</P>
<P>
The indictment also was a personal blow to Vice President Dick
Cheney. Libby, 55, has been described as Cheney's alter ego,
and the two men have been close since they worked
together at the Defense Department more than a decade ago.
In a statement, Cheney said he accepted Libby's resignation reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
"Scooter Libby is one of the most capable and talented individuals
I have ever known," Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
If the case comes to trial, Cheney is likely to be
called to testify. The indictment confirmed that Cheney told Libby
in a meeting on June 12, 2003, that Plame worked
for the CIA in the counterproliferation division -- information the
vice president learned from the CIA.
</P>
<P>
While the White House was relieved that Rove was not indicted,
the prospect of a criminal trial for Libby poses a
serious threat to the Bush administration: exposing secretive discussions by
top officials before and during the Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The case also could put a spotlight on the long-running feud
between Cheney's office and the CIA over intelligence on the
possibility of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that was
used to justify the 2003 invasion.
</P>
<P>
"This should have been played out in congressional hearings to delve
into the reasons for going to war," former U.S. attorney
Joseph diGenova said on CNN. "Now we are going to
have this played out in a criminal trial, which is
not a good way to discuss public policy, but it's
going to happen."
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald's two-year investigation focused on whether Bush administration officials deliberately leaked
Plame's identity in July 2003 to retaliate against her husband,
former U.S. ambassador Joseph Wilson, who had recently returned from
a trip to Niger to assess reports that Iraq had
tried to buy yellowcake uranium. Wilson disputed the administration's claims
that Iraq had sought the uranium to build nuclear weapons,
writing a July 6, 2003, op-ed article in the New
York Times titled "What I Didn't Find in Africa."
</P>
<P>
The piece was widely seen as an embarrassment for the administration.
Eight days after it was published, syndicated columnist Robert Novak
reported that two administration officials had told him Wilson had
been sent to Niger at the suggestion of his wife
and identified Plame as a CIA agent.
</P>
<P>
Libby, in his discussions with FBI agents and the grand jury,
maintained that he heard about Plame's covert status in discussions
with journalists.
</P>
<P>
But the indictment alleges that Libby actively sought information from government
officials about Wilson's trip to Africa and played a key
role in spreading the word that Wilson's wife was a
secret CIA operative.
</P>
<P>
When the investigation of the leak began in the fall of
2003, Libby told FBI agents that it was veteran NBC
newsman Tim Russert who told him, "Hey, do you know
that all reporters know that Mr. Wilson's wife works at
the CIA?" according to Fitzgerald. Libby then told the FBI
that he passed this information to Judith Miller of the
New York Times and Matthew Cooper of Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the grand jury, Libby noted that he learned
of Plame's identity from Cheney in June 2003, but he
said he had forgotten it. Libby said it was Russert's
phone call that led him to pass on the information
to Miller and Cooper.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a compelling story that would lead the FBI
to go away, if only it were true," Fitzgerald said.
"It's not true."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the indictment documents seven occasions on which Libby allegedly
discussed Plame's identity prior to his conversation with Russert. Libby
had discussed her role as a CIA agent with at
least four people in the government, including Cheney, and on
at least three occasions he shared the news of Plame's
identity with other government officials, the indictment says. The indictment
alleges that Libby's conversation with Russert was not about Plame's
identity.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said Libby was the first person to tell any reporter
about the case when the vice president's top aide revealed
it to Miller on June 23, 2003.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, what appears is that Mr.
Libby's story that he was at the tail end of
a chain of phone calls, passing on from one reporter
what he heard from another, was not true," Fitzgerald said.
"He was at the beginning of the chain of phone
calls, the first official to disclose this information outside the
government to a reporter. And then he lied about it
afterward, under oath and repeatedly."
</P>
<P>
Libby's lawyer, Joseph Tate, previewing what may be his defense strategy,
said it appeared that Libby's poor memory may have contributed
to the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
"As lawyers, we recognize that a person's recollection and memory of
events will not always match those of other people, particularly
when they are asked to testify months after the events
occurred," Tate said. "This is especially true in the hectic
rush of issues and events at a busy time for
our government."
</P>
<P>
Legal analysts speculated that Libby may agree to a plea deal
to reduce his sentence and to spare the administration a
long and embarrassing trial. But Tate said he planned a
vigorous defense of his client.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Wilson read a statement at the federal courthouse
in Washington, D.C., on Friday, saying the indictment marked a
"sad day for America."
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the final outcome of the investigation and the prosecution, I
continue to believe that revealing my wife Valerie's secret CIA
identity was very wrong and harmful to our nation," the
statement read. "I feel that my family was attacked for
my speaking the truth about the events that led our
country to war."

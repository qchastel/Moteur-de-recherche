Documents Reveal New Details of Libby Conversations

<P>
Court documents released Friday provide new details
about the testimony that Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of
staff gave to a grand jury investigating his conversations with
reporters and administration officials about a CIA operative.
</P>
<P>
The documents say Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby denied in his testimony
ever mentioning CIA operative Valerie Plame to former White House
press secretary Ari Fleischer or former New York Times reporter Judith
Miller in separate conversations he had with them in July 2003, and
further never disclosed talking to Miller about Plame in June 2003.
</P>
<P>
Libby was indicted in October on five counts of perjury, making
false statements and obstruction of justice in the course of Special
Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald's investigation into the leak of Plame's
identity to the media. The indictment charges that Libby lied to
investigators when he said he did not provide information about Plame
to two reporters and when he said he learned about Plame from a third,
NBC's Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
Libby has pleaded not guilty to the charges and a judge Friday set
his trial for January.
</P>
<P>
The information about Libby and other individuals' secret grand
jury testimony is included in sections of a once-sealed federal court
opinion, portions of which the court made public Friday. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that
because Libby had been indicted, much of the material in the opinion
that dealt with the grand jury investigation no longer needed to be
kept secret.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the details of the testimony reveal many more
insights into the case than Fitzgerald shared in his formal indictment
of Libby or in a news conference announcing the charges.
</P>
<P>
Miller testified last year that Libby first mentioned Plame to her
in a conversation in late June 2003 when she visited his office in the
Eisenhower Executive Office Building, and they discussed her again on
July 8 and July 12.
</P>
<P>
Fleischer testified that at a lunch with Libby in July 2003, Libby
relayed to him ``on the q.t.'' that former ambassador Joseph Wilson's
wife worked at the CIA and sent Wilson on a fact-finding trip to
Niger. Fleischer told the grand jury that he thought the lunch was
``kinda weird'' because Libby was normally ``tight-lipped'' and not so
chummy that he would share such confidences with the press secretary.
</P>
<P>
The papers reveal that Libby said he never discussed Wilson's wife
with Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
Also, Fitzgerald thought in February 2005 -- about a year into his
investigation of the leak of Plame's name -- that charging Libby with a
leak was ``off the table'' without other evidence, the court record
says. He stressed to the circuit court that it was essential, however,
to question journalists such as Miller before concluding whether Libby
had violated federal laws barring the release of the identity of
intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald began investigating in early 2004 whether administration
officials broke the law and leaked information about Plame as
retaliation. Her name and CIA role appeared in a July 2003 syndicated
column by Robert D. Novak -- eight days after Wilson publicly
criticized the Bush administration's justification for waging war with
Iraq.

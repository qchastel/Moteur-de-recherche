<P>
Karl Rove, the White House deputy chief of staff, told President George W. Bush
and others that he never engaged in an effort to disclose a CIA operative's
identity to discredit her husband's criticism of the administration's Iraq
policy, according to people with knowledge of Rove's account in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
They said Rove's denial to Bush occurred during a brief conversation in the fall
of 2003, shortly after media reports revealed that Valerie Plame, former
Ambassador Joseph Wilson's wife, worked as a covert CIA operative.
</P>
<P>
Those with direct knowledge of evidence gathered in the criminal investigation
spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of grand jury
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald is wrapping up an investigation into
whether Rove; Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter"
Libby; or other presidential aides divulged Plame's identity in violation of
federal law.
</P>
<P>
Besides the disclosure of Plame's identity, the investigation is examining
whether presidential aides mishandled classified information, made false
statements or obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
Rove is to testify before the grand jury soon for a fourth time, although
prosecutors have told him they no longer can assure he will avoid indictment.
Rove offered in July to return to the grand jury for additional testimony, and
Fitzgerald accepted that offer after taking grand jury testimony from the
formerly jailed New York Times reporter Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
The discussion with Bush, along with others, was general and did not get into
specifics concerning Rove's contacts with two reporters, Time magazine's Matthew
Cooper and syndicated columnist Robert Novak, who wrote stories identifying
Plame, the people familiar with Rove's account said.
</P>
<P>
They said Bush asked Rove to assure him he was not involved in an effort to
divulge Plame's identity and punish Wilson, and the longtime confidant assured
him that was so. He answered similarly when White House press secretary Scott
McClellan asked a similar question.
</P>
<P>
Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, refused to comment Friday on specifics of the
discussions with Bush but confirmed his client maintains _ then and now _ he did
not engage in an effort to disclose Plame's identity.
</P>
<P>
Rove has told a grand jury he first learned of Plame's work for the CIA from
news reporters and then discussed it with Novak and Cooper.
</P>
<P>
"Did Karl purposely set out to disclose Valerie Plame's identity in order to
punish Joe Wilson for his criticism? The answer is, `No,'" Luskin said. "That
was his answer in July 2003 and in October 2003 (when he first testified). And
it remains his answer today."
</P>
<P>
"He always truthfully denied that he was ever part of any campaign to punish Joe
Wilson by disclosing the identity of his wife," Luskin said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Rove's discussions with reporters, investigators also are looking into a
delay in learning about Rove's contact with Cooper and an e-mail between Rove
and now-National Security Adviser Steve Hadley that referenced the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
Cooper's contact with Rove did not come up in Rove's first interview or grand
jury appearance, but he volunteered the information and provided the e-mail
during a second grand jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
Wilson, Plame's husband, went public on July 6, 2003, with criticism of Bush
administration officials, suggesting they manipulated intelligence to justify
the Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Eight days later, Novak revealed the identity of Wilson's wife, giving her
maiden name, Valerie Plame, the name she used as a covert CIA officer. Novak
said his information about Wilson's wife had come from two senior administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
Rove acknowledged talking to Novak about the story. Cooper wrote a similar story
a few days after also talking with Rove.

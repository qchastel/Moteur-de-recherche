Top White House aide I. Lewis 
"Scooter" Libby was indicted Friday on five counts of obstruction of 
justice, making false statements and perjury.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Libby, who resigned immediately from his job as 
chief of staff to Vice President Dick Chency, faces up to 30 years 
in prison and a 1.24 million dollar fine.
</P>
<P>
The charges:
</P>
<P>
-- One count of obstruction of justice. The indictment alleges 
Libby, in his role as a senior government official, had access to 
classified information and came to learn the identity of a covert 
CIA agent whose husband was a critic of the Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges Libby then proceeded to "mislead and 
deceive the grand jury as to when, and the manner and means by which 
(he) acquired and subsequently disclosed to the media information 
concerning the employment of Valerie Plame by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
Plame is the wife of Joseph Wilson, a former ambassador who 
attacked the intelligence used by the administration to justify the 
Iraq invasion in March 2003.
</P>
<P>
If convicted on that count Libby faces up to 10 years in prison 
and a 250,000-dollar fine.
</P>
<P>
-- Two counts of making false statements. The indictment alleges 
that Libby lied to FBI agents who interviewed him on October 14 and 
November 26, 2003 about conversations he had with a reporter from 
NBC News and another from Time magazine concerning Plame's 
employment at the CIA.
</P>
<P>
Each count carries a maximum five years in prison and a 
250,000-dollar fine.
</P>
<P>
-- Two counts of perjury. The indictment alleges that Libby 
committed perjury while testifying under oath before the grand jury 
on March 5 and March 24, 2004. It alleges that Libby told jurors 
that he had learned from the media that Plame worked for the CIA 
when in fact he had learned about it from Vice President Cheney and 
officials at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
Each count carries a maximum five years in prison and a 
250,000-dollar fine.

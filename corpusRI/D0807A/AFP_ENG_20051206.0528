Valerie Plame to leave the CIA: report

LOS ANGELES, Dec 6
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valerie Plame, the spy whose outing 
sparked a major scandal and the indictment of a top White House 
official, is leaving the CIA, the Los Angeles Times said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Plame's undercover work at the Central Intelligence Agency was 
revealed in the US media shortly after her husband, former US 
diplomat Joseph Wilson, publicly criticized the US rationale for 
going to war with Iraq in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
Plame, 42, is a specialist in weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Friends said she would be spending more time in the future with 
her family, including her five year old twins, the newspaper 
reported.
</P>
<P>
After her outing, "she did not have a career left," Larry 
Johnson, a former CIA officer and a friend of Plame, told the Times. 
"She was no longer able to work as a clandestine officer, which was 
her reason for being."
</P>
<P>
The CIA, contacted by AFP, refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
Plame has been silent since the onset of the scandal but allowed 
herself to be photographed for the magazine Vanity Fair, which 
showed her seated beside her husband in a convertible, mysterious in 
a scarf and dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
A two-year probe into who illegally leaked Plame's identity 
landed one journalist in jail for 85 days for refusing to divulge 
her source, and toppled a top White House official.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff I. Lewis 
'Scooter' Libby was charged with five counts of obstruction of 
justice, perjury and making false statements, arising from the 
probe.
</P>
<P>
Libby pleaded not guilty to the charges and resigned his White 
House job to fight them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lawyer for Karl Rove, President George W. Bush's 
chief political aide, said Rove has been told he is still under 
investigation over the leak of Plame's identity.

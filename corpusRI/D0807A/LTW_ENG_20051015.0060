Times' Miller Says Libby Told Her About CIA Operative
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Cheney's chief of staff discussed with New York
Times correspondent Judith Miller the fact that the wife of a White
House critic worked for the CIA on as many as three occasions before
the woman, Valerie Plame, was publicly identified, according to a
Times account published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During two of the 2003 conversations with I. Lewis ``Scooter''
Libby, Miller said, she wrote versions of Plame's name in her
notebook, although in one of these she believes the name came from
another confidential source she said she cannot recall.
</P>
<P>
In a disclosure that could figure in special prosecutor Patrick J.
Fitzgerald's investigation, Miller said she initially refused to
testify about her discussions with Libby because she believed he was
signaling her that she should not cooperate in the CIA leak
investigation unless her account would clear him.
</P>
<P>
Miller said her lawyer Floyd Abrams told her that Libby's attorney,
Joseph Tate, had related part of Libby's grand jury testimony and was
``pressing about what you would say. When I wouldn't give him an
assurance that you would exonerate Libby, if you were to cooperate, he
then immediately gave me this, 'Don't go there,' or 'We don't want you
there.' ''
</P>
<P>
Tate strongly denied such a conversation in an e-mail to the Times,
calling the account ``outrageous'' and insisting that ``I never once
suggested that she should not testify. It was just the opposite.'' He
did not return a phone call from The Washington Post Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Miller was jailed for 85 days for refusing to testify about Libby,
until she reached an accommodation last month with Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald has been investigating whether any administration
officials -- including Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, who testified
for a fourth time Friday -- broke the law by disclosing the identity of
a covert CIA operative. Lawyers involved in the case have said they
believe he is investigating other potential crimes, such as whether
there was a conspiracy in the administration to discredit Plame's
husband and White House critic, former ambassador Joseph Wilson IV. A
grand jury examining the issue expires on Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
Libby, though little known to the public, was a major supporter of
the Iraq war and wields great influence on foreign policy and other
issues within the administration.
</P>
<P>
In the first on-the-record account of what she told a federal grand
jury in two recent appearances, Miller described a meeting on June 23,
2003, with Libby in the Old Executive Office Building. She said her
notes leave open the possibility that Libby told her Wilson's wife
might work at the CIA. ``Wife works at bureau?'' the notes say.
</P>
<P>
This conversation -- for which Miller only recently found her notes
-- occurred when Wilson had not yet gone public with his criticism that
President Bush had exaggerated evidence that Iraq was seeking weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
During that encounter, Miller said in the Times, Libby was angry
about reports that Cheney and other senior officials had embraced
flimsy evidence about Iraq seeking nuclear material in the African
nation of Niger and was concerned about ``selective leaking'' by the
CIA to distance the agency if no illegal Iraqi weapons were found.
Libby noted that the CIA had sent a ``clandestine guy'' -- a reference
to Wilson -- to Niger on a fact-finding mission.
</P>
<P>
On July 8, 2003 -- two days after Wilson published a denunciation of
the White House on the weapons issue -- Miller had breakfast with Libby
at the St. Regis Hotel. Miller said Libby told her that Wilson's wife
worked for a CIA bureau called Winpac, for weapons intelligence,
nonproliferation and arms control. Miller said she testified, however,
that Libby did not refer to Plame by name or mention her covert
status.
</P>
<P>
Her notebook from that day includes the notation ``Valerie Flame,''
but she says the name appeared in a different section of the notebook
from her Libby interview notes and that she believes it came from
another source.
</P>
<P>
That raises the question of whether other administration officials
discussed Plame's CIA status with Miller after Libby, by her
recollection, was the first to raise it. By the time she and Libby
discussed Plame again, by phone on July 12, Miller said, she had
talked about Wilson's wife -- her notes from that conversation refer
incorrectly to ``Victoria Wilson'' -- with other unidentified sources.
Fitzgerald lost the opportunity to question Miller about these sources
by agreeing, as part of the deal that led to her release from jail
last month, to ask only about conversations with Libby.
</P>
<P>
It is not known precisely what Libby has told the grand jury. A
source close to the Cheney aide has said that Libby did acknowledge
discussing Wilson's wife with Miller but that he never knew Plame's
name or her covert status.
</P>
<P>
The probe was triggered after syndicated columnist Robert D. Novak
wrote on July 14, 2003, that ``two senior administration officials''
had told him that Plame was a CIA operative who had helped arrange her
husband's 2002 trip to Niger to investigate whether Iraq had sought to
buy weapons-grade uranium there.
</P>
<P>
Miller said Fitzgerald asked her before the grand jury whether
Libby ever indicated that Cheney had approved of Libby's interviews
with her or was aware of them. The answer, she said, was no.
</P>
<P>
By Miller's account, Fitzgerald asked during her testimony
``whether I thought Mr. Libby had tried to shape my testimony''
through a letter he sent while she was in jail in suburban Alexandria,
Va. In the letter, Libby urged Miller to accept his waiver of the
confidentiality she had promised him after initially rejecting such an
offer as not fully voluntary.
</P>
<P>
``The public report of every other reporter's testimony makes clear
that they did not discuss Ms. Plame's name or identity with me,''
Libby wrote. Miller said she testified that the wording surprised her
``because it might be perceived as an effort by Mr. Libby to suggest
that I, too, would say we had not discussed Ms. Plame's identity. Yet
my notes suggested that we had discussed her job.''
</P>
<P>
Times Executive Editor Bill Keller was quoted as saying: ``Judy
believed Libby was afraid of her testimony. She thought Libby had
reason to be afraid of her testimony.''
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. told the paper:
``Maybe a deal was possible earlier. ... If so, shame on us. I tend to
think not.''
</P>
<P>
The article and accompanying first-person piece by Miller, posted
online Saturday and published in Sunday's editions, contain
conflicting accounts of why Miller never wrote a story about the
outing of Plame. Miller told her newspaper that she ``made a strong
recommendation to my editor'' that a story be pursued but ``was told
no.'' She would not identify the editor. Managing Editor Jill
Abramson, the Washington bureau chief at the time, said Miller never
made any such recommendation.
</P>
<P>
Another possible conflict between Miller and the Times involves a
Post report in fall 2003 that ``two top White House officials
disclosed Plame's identity to at least six Washington journalists.''
Philip Taubman, who succeeded Abramson as Washington bureau chief,
said he asked Miller whether she was among the six, which she denied.
Miller told him the subject of Wilson and his wife had come up in
casual conversation with government officials, Taubman said, and ``she
had not been at the receiving end of a concerted effort, a deliberate
organized effort to put out information.''
</P>
<P>
One journalistic issue involves what Miller describes as her
agreement to modify her description of Libby as a ``senior
administration official'' when it came to information about Libby.
Miller said she agreed to describe Libby only as a ``former Hill
staffer,'' which is technically accurate because he once worked on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
The publication follows weeks of criticism of the Times for failing
to tell the full story of its reporter's involvement. Keller said in a
statement that ``no other reporter drawn into this investigation has
provided such a detailed report. We're relieved that we can finally
put this story in the hands of our readers, who will draw their own
conclusions.'' Times editors would not comment further, a spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
Miller, a Pulitzer Prize winner, says she went to see Libby in June
2003 as part of a team effort to examine why no illegal weapons were
found in Iraq. Libby, she said, wanted to talk about Wilson's mission
to Niger.
</P>
<P>
In agreeing to testify, Miller acknowledged in the Times account,
she was worried about the prospect of spending many more months in
jail. She said she decided to accept Libby's waiver after receiving
his letter and asking him in a phone conversation: ``Do you really
want me to testify? Are you sure you really want me to testify?''
Libby's reply was something like ``absolutely,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
Miller's attorney Abrams and Times Co. lawyer George Freeman told
the paper they worried that Miller's decision to testify would prompt
observers to say the newspaper had caved in.
</P>
<P>
One unusual aspect of the Times account is that it acknowledges
what a controversial figure Miller, 57, has been at the paper. One
former editor, Douglas Frantz, said Miller once called herself ``Miss
Run Amok'' and said it meant ``I can do whatever I want.''
</P>
<P>
Her reputation suffered a ``blow,'' the Times acknowledged, after
some of her stories on whether Saddam Hussein harbored illegal weapons
did not pan out. ``I told her there was unease, discomfort,
unhappiness over some of the coverage,'' said Roger Cohen, the foreign
editor at the time. Miller conceded that ``I got it totally wrong''
but blamed the misinformation on her sources.
</P>
<P>
Miller would not allow the Times reporters to review her notes and
would not discuss her interactions with editors, the article said.
</P>
<P>
To a remarkable degree, Miller was calling the shots on dealing
with Fitzgerald's inquiry. Keller and Sulzberger both told the paper
that they did not press Miller for details of her conversations with
Libby or ask to see her notes while battling Fitzgerald's subpoena in
the courts.
</P>
<P>
Even after other news organizations disclosed that Libby was
Miller's source, Times editors did not publish his name, discouraged
some story suggestions by reporters and killed an article about
Libby's role in the high-profile case.
</P>
<P>
The case, which cost the Times millions of dollars in legal fees,
so constrained its coverage that the paper did not name Libby as
Miller's source until well after other news organizations did. Keller
said he largely ceded supervision of the story to managing editor
Abramson because ``it was just too awkward'' for him while enmeshed in
meetings about the paper's defense of Miller.
</P>
<P>
Asked what she regretted about the Times' handling of the matter,
Abramson told the paper, ``The entire thing.''

Special prosecutor Fitzgerald appears at federal courthouse in continuing CIA leak probe

<P>
Six weeks after a White House aide was indicted in the CIA leak case, special
prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was back at work Wednesday before another grand
jury with top presidential political adviser Karl Rove still under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald did not comment on the nearly-three-hour grand jury session where the
prosecutor was accompanied by three deputies and an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
Rove, one of President George W. Bush's most powerful advisers, has been
noticeably at Bush's side this week after weeks of avoiding many public
appearances with the president.
</P>
<P>
A renewal of interest in the case would threaten to derail Bush's efforts to
overcome some of the lowest approval ratings of his presidency, dragged down by
a public uproar over the CIA leak investigation as well as the unpopular war in
Iraq and the administration's fumbling of Hurricane Katrina relief.
</P>
<P>
In the last grand jury activity in the leak probe, on Oct. 28, I. Lewis
"Scooter" Libby, a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, was indicted on five
counts of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to the FBI. Libby resigned
and has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
For nearly two years, Fitzgerald has been looking into who leaked the identity
of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame to the news media.
</P>
<P>
Plame's identity was disclosed eight days after her husband, former U.S.
ambassador Joseph Wilson, publicly accused the administration of twisting
intelligence to exaggerate the Iraqi threat in the run-up to the
war.
</P>
<P>
Rove was not indicted, but Fitzgerald made clear at the time of the Libby
indictment that his investigation is not finished.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor underscored that point in court papers last month, saying that
the probe continues and will involve proceedings before a different grand jury.
The first grand jury term expired the day it indicted Libby.
</P>
<P>
Rove's legal problems stem from the fact that it was not until more than a year
into the criminal investigation that he told the prosecutor about disclosing the
CIA status of Wilson's wife to Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper on July 11,
2003.
</P>
<P>
Rove says he had forgotten the Cooper conversation, which occurred days before
Plame's identity was revealed by conservative columnist Robert
Novak.
</P>
<P>
The presidential adviser revealed the CIA employment of Wilson's wife to Cooper
two days after the presidential aide and Novak discussed Plame's CIA
status.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department launched the criminal investigation 2 1/2 months later,
prompting the White House to insist that neither Rove nor Libby had been
involved in leaking Plame's identity.

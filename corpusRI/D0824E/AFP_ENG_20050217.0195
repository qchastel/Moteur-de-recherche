<P>
Scientists in the Netherlands say they 
have developed a powerful diagnostic tool, based on a telltale gene 
"signature," that could help breast-cancer patients avoid 
unnecessary follow-up treatment.
</P>
<P>
The research, reported in next Saturday's issue of the British 
medical weekly The Lancet, is focussed on a condition called 
lymph-node negative breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
If diagnosed in time, up to 70 percent of women who are given 
surgery or radiotherapy for this disease are cured.
</P>
<P>
The treatment usually entails follow-up care in the form of 
chemotherapy -- powerful drugs that act on tumours -- or hormone 
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Such medication is routinely recommended as a precaution to 
prevent any recurrence of the cancer. Only about a third of all 
patients actually need the follow-up therapy, however, which can be 
aggressive with big side-effects.
</P>
<P>
Dutch doctors believe that the new diagnostic can help pinpoint 
those women who are genetically more at risk of a recurrence than 
others, and this could spare low-risk patients from having to 
undergo unnecessary follow-up treatment.
</P>
<P>
They found a "signature" of protein markers, expressed by 76 
genes, which were frequently found among 115 stored tumours taken 
from patients who had lymph-node negative breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
The team then tested the "signature" on the genetic profile of 
171 other cancer patients who had had initial treatment for their 
tumour and whose health had been carefully monitored over the next 
five years to see if the cancer had returned.
</P>
<P>
They found the "signature" was 93-percent accurate in predicting 
those who had had a recurrence within five years, although it was 
much less precise (48-percent accurate) in predicting patients whose 
disease did not return in that time.
</P>
<P>
Breast cancer, like ovarian cancer, is a "silent killer" of 
women.
</P>
<P>
This is why doctors recommend regular mammary screenings and why 
they are so keen on getting a tool to help identify women who could 
be genetically at risk.
</P>
<P>
The study is led by John Foekens of the Erasmus Medical Centre 
in Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
Several previous studies have also identified gene "signatures" 
to test for breast cancer, although this is the largest by far.
</P>
<P>
The problem though is that the proposed "signatures" either 
overlap or are different. At the moment, there is no global 
agreement as to what should be the common set of genes that should 
be incorporated in a standard test.

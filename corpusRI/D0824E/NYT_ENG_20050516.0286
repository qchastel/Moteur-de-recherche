STUDY OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS FINDS BENEFIT IN LOW-FAT DIETS

Breast cancer patients who follow diets low in fat may reduce
the chance that their tumors will return, scientists reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was, researchers said, the first time that a large, rigorous
study showed that diet could have any impact on any
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Women in the study who were assigned to follow a low-fat
diet had more than a 20 percent reduction in their
rate of recurrence over five years, the investigators found. Of
975 women assigned to a low-fat diet, 96, or 9.8
percent, had recurrences. But 181 of 1,462 women, or 12.4
percent, who were assigned to maintain their usual diet had
their cancer return.

The study's principal investigator, Dr. Rowan T. Chlebowski of the Los
Angeles Biomedical Research Institute in Torrance, Calif., described the data
Monday at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology in Orlando.

In a telephone interview, Chlebowski explained that the women already had
had the standard medical treatment -- lumpectomy or mastectomy followed
by radiation and then hormonal therapy or chemotherapy when appropriate.
Although the treatments varied, the two groups were equivalent because
the women were assigned at random to follow a low-fat
diet. The additional benefit from diet, Chlebowski said, was equivalent
to adding a new drug to their regimen.

"This is the first randomized clinical trial showing that diet may
have an impact on breast cancer outcome, or any cancer
outcome, for that matter," Chlebowski said.
</P>
<P>
But he and independent experts at the meeting and elsewhere said
the study's findings, which were only marginally statistically significant, must
be confirmed before recommending that women with breast cancer follow
such a diet.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear, they said, what made the difference. It
could be the small amount of fat the women ate,
or it could be that they lost weight. Other studies
have found that breast cancer is less likely to recur
in women who lose weight after their initial treatment. The
study began in 1994 and enrolled 2,437 postmenopausal women with
early-stage breast cancer. Of them, 975 were assigned to a
diet so low in fat that, Chlebowski said, it was
about as low as possible without being a vegetarian diet.
They consumed on average 33.3 grams of fat a day.
</P>
<P>
The 1,462 women in the control group, who were instructed to
follow their usual diet, consumed 51.3 grams of fat a
day.

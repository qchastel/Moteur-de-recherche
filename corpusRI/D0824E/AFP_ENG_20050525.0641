<P>
Women stricken with breast cancer can 
boost their chances of survival by 50 percent with some exercise, 
according to a study published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is good news for women with breast cancer," said Doctor 
Michelle Holmes, a Harvard Medical School assistant professor who 
led the study published in the Journal of the Medical Association 
(JAMA).
</P>
<P>
"Women with breast cancer have little to lose and much to gain 
from exercise," Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted among some 3,000 nurses diagnosed with 
different stages of breast cancer between 1984-1998 and who were 
monitored until June 2002.
</P>
<P>
The research showed that walking at an average pace for three to 
five hours a week reduced the risk of death by 50 percent compared 
to more sedentary women.
</P>
<P>
"The most logical explanation is that physical activity lowers 
hormone levels, and the lower hormone levels reduce the chances of a 
recurrence," Homes said.
</P>
<P>
"Women don't have to run marathons for the maximum benefit," she 
added.
</P>
<P>
Some 211,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year 
in the United States, and 40,000 die of the disease each year, the 
second deadliest after lung cancer.

Sisters help scientists puzzle out genes' role in breast cancer

A new U.S. study will investigate genetic and environmental causes of
breast cancer by enrolling 50,000 sisters of women already diagnosed
with the disease.

<P>
The Sister Study, conducted by the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences, part of the government's National
Institutes of Health, is the largest study of its kind.

"By studying sisters who share the same genes, often had similar
experiences and environments, and are at twice the risk of developing
breast cancer, we have a better chance of learning what causes this
disease," Dr. Dale Sandler, the study's principal investigator, said
in a statement Monday.

<P>
The sisters who volunteer will donate blood, urine, toenails _ even
household dust _ to help uncover how daily rituals and routines, as
well as genetics, factor into breast cancer risk.

"Genes are important, but they don't explain it all," said Sandler,
chief of the epidemiology branch at the environmental health
institute. "The truth is that only half of breast cancer cases can be
attributed to known factors."
</P>
<P>
For instance, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that normally limit cell
growth. Women who inherit an altered version of either gene have a
higher risk of getting breast or ovarian cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2,
however, are implicated in just 5 percent to 10 percent of breast
cancer cases.

Breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women,
after skin cancer. Some 215,990 American women will be diagnosed with
breast cancer this year, according to the American Cancer Society.
The disease will kill about 40,110 American women in 2004, according
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
To be eligible for the study, women need to be between 35 and 74
years old. Women who have not been diagnosed with breast cancer are
eligible if a sister, living or dead, has had breast cancer. The
women will be tracked for 10 years so researchers can study what
links the few who get breast cancer compared with the majority who do
not.

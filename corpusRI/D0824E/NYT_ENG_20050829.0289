LESS PAINFUL BREAST CANCER BIOPSY SHOWS PROMISE FOR TUMOR DETECTION

Detecting the spread of breast cancer in women
with large tumors may have just become easier.
</P>
<P>
Typically, surgeons remove 10 or more lymph nodes from the patient's
armpit to look for the spread of cancer. The painful
operation sometimes causes swelling, numbness and infection.
</P>
<P>
But new research released this week by the University of North
Carolina School of Medicine says a less invasive surgery now
used with small tumors is also effective.
</P>
<P>
"There are a few individual centers using it on large tumors,"
said Dr. David W. Ollila, a UNC surgeon and researcher.
"Now we need a national study."
</P>
<P>
Lymph node dissection is much like interviewing the eyewitnesses closest to
the crime scene. Instead of removing 10 or more lymph
nodes and analyzing all of them to look for cancer,
this procedure removes only the node that is closest to
the cancer and most likely to have it.
</P>
<P>
If this node, called the sentinel, is clean, chances are the
other nodes have not been affected.
</P>
<P>
The new study from the medical school is published in the
September issue of the American Journal of Surgery. It shows
that sentinel-node biopsy, when performed before chemotherapy is given to
shrink the tumor, is very reliable, the UNC researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The study suggests that sentinel-node biopsy is an option that might
benefit all women with breast cancers, said Ollila, associate professor
of surgery at UNC and a member of the UNC
Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
"I think any woman diagnosed with breast cancer should ask her
physician what role this technique might play in her overall
treatment," Ollila said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the controversy in medical circles about the surgery, which
uses a dye injection to stain the first affected lymph
node.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rosa Cuenca, a surgical oncologist at East Carolina University's Brody
School of Medicine, said the procedure has been controversial for
large tumors. She compares large tumors to wrecked cars on
the freeway. When the dye used in the procedure can't
get down the road, sometimes it goes around on other
pathways, identifying the wrong lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
Also, some surgeons advocate performing the sentinel-node biopsy procedure in women
with large tumors only after chemotherapy, to discover how much
of the tumor remains. However, results of UNC researchers show
that performing the procedure before treatment provides a more accurate
picture of lymph node involvement, Ollila said.
</P>
<P>
Subjects in the study were 21 breast cancer patients with tumors
large enough in relation to the size of the breast
that the breast could not be preserved.
</P>
<P>
Such patients usually get chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before surgery,
to decrease chances of recurrence and, for a small number
of women, to make it feasible to have a lumpectomy
rather than a mastectomy. In the UNC tests, researchers performed
sentinel-node biopsy before chemotherapy, modifying the technique slightly for larger
cancers.
</P>
<P>
If the test procedure showed disease in the sentinel node or
if the tumor was larger than five centimeters in diameter,
all the nodes were removed and the patient received chemotherapy
and surgery. If the biopsy showed tumor-free sentinel nodes and
the tumor was less than five centimeters, no further lymph
nodes were removed and the patient received chemotherapy and tumor
removal.
</P>
<P>
In an average of 36 months of post-treatment follow-up, none of
the patients showed progression of cancer in the lymph nodes.
The sentinel-node biopsy accurately predicted node involvement, Ollila said.

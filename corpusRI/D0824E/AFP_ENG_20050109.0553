Olive oil can help fight breast 
cancer, a discovery that researchers said in a study out Sunday 
could guide the development of related treatment.

"Our findings underpin epidemiological studies that show that 
the Mediterranean diet has significant protective effects against 
cancer, heart disease and ageing," said the study's lead author 
Javier Menendez, of Northwestern University's Feinberg medical 
school in Chicago.

Researchers showed in a series of laboratory experiments on 
breast cancer cells that oleic acid, found in olive oil, 
dramatically cuts the levels of a cancer-promoting gene called 
Her-2/neu (also known as erb B-2), according to Menendez.
</P>
<P>
High levels of the gene occur in over a fifth of breast cancer 
patients and are associated with highly aggressive tumors that have 
a poor prognosis, according to findings reported in the January 10 
Annals of Oncology.
</P>
<P>
Oleic acid suppressed the gene, and other tests showed that it 
boosted an antibody treatment trastuzumab (Herceptin), which targets 
the gene and has helped to prolong the lives of many breast cancer 
patients, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Menendez said the findings should not only help in understanding 
the molecular mechanisms by which individual dietary fatty acids 
regulate the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells, but also 
suggested eating oleic acid may help Herceptin work in breast cancer 
patients with the Her-2/neu gene.
</P>
<P>
"To our knowledge this is the first report that a dietary 
monounsaturated fatty acid previously suggested to be protective 
against breast cancer significantly down-regulates the expression of 
Her-2/neu, cutting it by up to 46 percent. Her-2/neu is one of the 
most important oncogenes in breast cancer," said Menendez.
</P>
<P>
"In our tests, oleic acid's inhibition of Her-2/neu 
synergistically interacted with Herceptin-based immunotherapy by 
promoting the death of breast cancer cells exhibiting high levels of 
the oncogene.
</P>
<P>
"Additionally, alongside the sensitizing effect of oleic acid on 
the efficacy of Herceptin we found it increased the expression of a 
protein (p27Kip1), a tumor suppresser protein, which is implicated 
in the development of resistance to Herceptin treatment."

Menendez worked with Ruth Lupu, director of the Evanston 
Northwestern Health Research Institute's Breast Cancer Translational 
Program and Ramon Colomer, head of the Medical Oncology Division at 
Institut Catala d' Oncologia in Girona, Spain.

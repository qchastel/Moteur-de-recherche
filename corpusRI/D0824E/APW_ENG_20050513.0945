Major new analysis shows breast cancer drugs prevent recurrence, prolong survival

<P>
The risk of dying from breast cancer has been falling rapidly for the past 15
years mainly because the drugs used to treat the disease have been effective at
stopping the cancer from returning, according to a major new
analysis.
</P>
<P>
Although surgery and radiation therapy can seem to wipe out the disease in
early-stage breast cancer, undetected cancer cells can remain and unleash a
life-threatening recurrence years later.
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that drugs given to prevent cancer's return can improve the
survival rates five years after diagnosis and that the effects last at least 10
years. Several studies have followed women for 15 years, but no single study has
been big enough to reliably show the full scope.
</P>
<P>
In a review published Friday in The Lancet medical journal, researchers led by
scientists at Oxford University in England analyzed the combined evidence from
194 studies involving more than 145,000 women with early stage breast cancer who
were treated with drugs that were being tested during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
They found that the benefits of these drugs are remarkably persistent 15 years
after diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
The analysis found that where both chemotherapy and hormone therapy were
appropriate, the risk of death within 15 years of diagnosis could be cut in
half, so that if a 50-year-old woman had a 1-in-5 chance of dying from her
cancer, the drugs could bring the risk down to 1 in 10.
</P>
<P>
For women of any age with hormone-sensitive breast cancer _ the most common type
_ giving tamoxifen for five years reduced the breast cancer death rate over the
next 15 years by about one-third.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Karen Gelmon and colleagues at the British Columbia Cancer Agency in
Vancouver, who were not connected with the research, noted, however, that the
review analyzed older treatment strategies and did not evaluate newer drugs that
are standard therapy today.
</P>
<P>
The therapies studied in the Lancet paper have been proven, she said, but the
next challenge is to cure even more women with newer and more targeted
drugs.
</P>
<P>
However, the work is important in confirming the benefits over time from
chemotherapy and hormone treatments, and will be reassuring to doctors and
patients, she said.
</P>
<P>
The review is the fourth analysis to be conducted by the same group of
scientists on the largest database of patients for any type of cancer. About
1.15 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed every year
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reviews assessed the effect of various drugs on recurrence and survival
over five and 10 years. The last overview, in 2000, found that better treatments
over the preceding decade had slashed breast cancer death rates in Britain and
the United States by one-quarter among some groups.

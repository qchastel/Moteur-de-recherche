Study Cites Longer-Term Risk in Type of Breast Cancer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A form of breast cancer, which under the microscope can sometimes
appear as a benign condition, actually carries a 40-year risk of
flaring into invasive cancer with a capacity to spread, medical
experts say.
</P>
<P>
But even with new insight into a type of breast cancer doctors call
ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, there is still debate over how to
treat it: Do all patients need surgery and radiation, or can some skip
them?
</P>
<P>
Physicians Melinda Sanders and David Page of Vanderbilt University
Medical Center in Memphis, Tenn., have conducted the largest analysis
to date on the form of DCIS known as low-grade, which because of the
appearance of the cells can be mistaken for atypical ductal
hyperplasia, a benign disorder. Sanders and Page report the results of
their research in Cancer, an American Cancer Society publication.

<P>
``For a long time, people have tried to treat DCIS as one disease,
but it is a spectrum that ranges from low to medium to high grade,''
Sanders said Monday.
</P>
<P>
She said atypical ductal hyperplasia should be closely monitored,
but DCIS should be removed in most but probably not all women.
</P>
<P>
The analysis spanned 40 years to finally document ``the natural
history'' of this low-grade cancer -- how long it takes to develop and
whether it routinely evolves into invasive breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
Sanders and Page examined specimens from 1950 to 1968 and followed
the fate of the women who were diagnosed but untreated in what Sanders
called the ``pre-mammographic era.'' This made the cases especially
compelling, Sanders said, because it allowed the team to determine how
the disorder progresses over many decades.
</P>
<P>
Findings revealed that low-grade DCIS developed into invasive
cancers in 40 percent of patients with the risk extending over a
40-year period.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the new conclusions, older women may want to leave
low-grade DCIS untreated, Sanders said. ``This long natural history
means that if this diagnosis is made in a woman 65 or 70 years old, it
could be 40 years before she developed cancer.''
</P>
<P>
Treatment issues involving all grades of DCIS -- low, medium and
high -- have been a source of discussion for years, said Dr. Daniel
Budman, associate director of oncology at North Shore University
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Even geography plays a role in how women are treated, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is debate over radiation treatment and there is a difference
over whether you live on the West Coast or the East Coast,`` Budman
said. ''On the West Coast (doctors) are less likely to use radiation;
on the East coast they're more likely to recommend it.``

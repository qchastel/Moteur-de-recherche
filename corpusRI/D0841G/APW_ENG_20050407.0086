New England emerging as the regional holdout in state by state march to ban gay marriages

<P>
It seems a can't-lose proposition: Ask voters to ban same-sex marriages and they
consistently endorse the idea, from the South to the West.
</P>
<P>
Kansas on Tuesday became the latest and 18th state to pass a constitutional
amendment barring gay marriage. With conservatives pushing to define marriage as
between a man and woman throughout the country, similar proposals are on the
ballot in three other states next year and more than a dozen are considering
them.
</P>
<P>
The northeastern New England states have been the major holdout; there,
legislators and judges have strengthened rights for gays and lesbians. The
Connecticut Senate on Wednesday voted to legalize civil unions. If the bill
becomes law, Connecticut would be the only state to do so without a court order
demanding lawmakers act.
</P>
<P>
Kansans voted by a more than 2-to-1 margin Tuesday to ban gay marriages and
civil unions, and voters also ousted the lone gay city council member in Topeka,
Tiffany Muller, who had defeated an emphatically anti-gay opponent in the
primary.
</P>
<P>
The New England examples _ most decisively Vermont's civil unions and
Massachusetts' legalized gay marriages _ are seen by ban supporters as the
threat that's helping their cause. Advocates for gay marriage also see those
examples as a plus, by proving that fears gay marriage will somehow destroy
society's social fabric are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
"The more places that we are able to extend the same rights and responsibilities
to all Americans, the more places we've got a light to shine on what's
happening," said Joe Solmonese, president of Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights
lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
"Massachusetts, the last time I checked ... is still there. Marriage is still
there," he said. "People are going on with their lives, gay and lesbian couples
are raising their families and living their lives like everyone else. None of
what has been forecasted or what we've been warned about seems to have happened
there."
</P>
<P>
New England states aren't the only ones to offer gay rights activists hope.
California, Hawaii and New Jersey also allow for domestic partnerships _ though
California and Hawaii also have states laws that define marriage as between a
man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
Connecticut offers the strongest recent pro-gay legislation, by extending all
rights and privileges of marriage to same-sex couples but without an actual
marriage license.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the state Senate voted 27-9 to recognize civil unions; proponents
say the bill will likely clear the House _ also controlled by the Democrats _
possibly as early as next week. Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell has not taken a
stand on the bill, but has said she supports the concept of civil
unions.
</P>
<P>
In Maine, a new law signed last month protects gays and lesbians from
discrimination, though it made clear it doesn't extend the rights of marriage.
The state already allows for domestic partners, who could be homosexual or
heterosexual, to have many of the legal rights of marriage, such as rights to
inheritance and benefits.
</P>
<P>
New Hampshire set up a commission to study civil unions after legislators last
year refused to recognize gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
For ban supporters, the key difference is a vote of the people.
</P>
<P>
"When the people are given a chance to decide, their view is overwhelming," said
Peter Sprigg at the conservative Family Research Council. "Every state that had
this on the ballot passed it. It shows to me there is a tremendous grass roots
consensus that marriage is between a man and a woman."
</P>
<P>
Voters will decide the question in Alabama in June 2006, and in South Dakota and
Tennessee at the 2006 election. Bills are also moving forward in Minnesota,
South Carolina and Texas to put the measure on the ballot there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, courts are continuing to hash out the dispute, giving hope to both
sides. A California state judge ruled last month that the state law banning gay
marriage was unconstitutional and that gay couples can marry. A New York state
judge ruled along similar lines in February. Both decisions are under
appeal.
</P>
<P>
"To be frank, every time one of those decisions comes down it just adds fuel to
the fire for our efforts," Sprigg said. "Courts are trying to take the decision
out of the hands of the people."
</P>
<P>
Yale law Professor William Eskridge, a constitutional scholar active in support
of gay rights issues, said that, in the end, New England won't be the lone
holdout, and expects resistance to the bans across the Northeast and the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
But much of the rest of the country would likely back a ban, he said, predicting
as many as 40 states would adopt them. Ultimately, the dispute will be decided
by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
And by then, years of gays and lesbians living as partners recognized by
Massachusetts, Vermont and elsewhere will test the warnings of critics that gay
marriage is a threat to the institution of marriage, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have laboratories to observe whether these predictions would come true,"
Eskridge said. "Now we can wait to see who's right."

<P>
The issue of same-sex marriage 
is open for debate in Maryland, after a judge in the eastern US 
state rejected a state law banning such unions.
</P>
<P>
Baltimore Judge Brooke Murdock ruled that prohibiting gay 
marriage was discriminatory and in violation of the state's 
constitution
</P>
<P>
State officials immediately appealed the ruling, setting the 
stage for another court battle on the controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
A 1973 Maryland law rules that only marriages between a man and 
a woman are valid, but Murdock ruled in favor of 19 gays and 
lesbians who filed suit last year, insisting that the law violated 
the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts is the only US state to recognize gay marriage, 
while Vermont and Connecticut recognize civil unions for same-sex 
couples.
</P>
<P>
The legality of same-sex marriage is also being debated in 
courts in California, New Jersey, New York and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
Some 18 states, meanwhile, have formally declared that marriage 
is exclusively for heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
Following Murdock's ruling, Maryland's Republican Governor 
Robert Ehrlich spoke out in favor of a constitutional amendment 
stipulating that marriages must be between a man and a woman.

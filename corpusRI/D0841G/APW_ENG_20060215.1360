Two U.S. states took up the issue of gay marriage on Wednesday, with preliminary
arguments heard in a New Jersey Supreme Court case and a constitutional
amendment against gay marriage passing in Idaho's state Senate.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court Justices in New Jersey grilled lawyers about why the state should
prevent homosexual couples from marrying in a case involving seven same-sex
couples who sued the state, saying it is violating its constitution by denying
them the right to marry.
</P>
<P>
Conservative groups filed documents contending that allowing same-sex marriage
would harm society. The state of New Jersey did not make that argument in
defending its ban, but said allowing same-sex marriage is an issue for
lawmakers, not judges.
</P>
<P>
"To allow same-sex couples to marry would not be removing a barrier to marriage,
but redefining marriage itself," state Attorney General Patrick DeAlmeida told
the seven-member court.
</P>
<P>
Gay marriage is prohibited in all but one of the 50 U.S. states. There are
currently 18 U.S. states with constitutional amendments against gay marriage.
Most of those amendments were adopted after Massachusetts' highest court
legalized same-sex marriage in 2003, raising fears that courts in other states
might do the same.
</P>
<P>
Vermont and Connecticut allow civil unions for gays, while California, New
Jersey, Maine and Hawaii recognize more limited forms of gay
partnership.
</P>
<P>
DeAlmeida fielded the brunt of the New Jersey judges' questions, including what
might be protected by preventing same-sex marriage in New Jersey, one of 16
states where it's specifically illegal to discriminate based on sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
The state also has no legal barriers for same-sex couples to adopt children and
recognizes domestic partnerships, although those do not offer all the legal
protections of marriage.
</P>
<P>
David Buckell, attorney for the seven couples, talked about the personal stories
of some of his clients.
</P>
<P>
"How do plaintiffs answer their children's questions about why they are not
married?" he said. "The only answer is that the state does not think their
relationships are worthy."
</P>
<P>
The court is not expected to issue a decision for months.
</P>
<P>
Both supporters and opponents of gay marriage held rallies Wednesday outside the
building housing the high court.
</P>
<P>
In Idaho, a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage passed 26-9
in the state Senate on Wednesday and will go to voters this November.
</P>
<P>
If approved, it would mean that in Idaho, "a marriage between a man and a woman
is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized."
</P>
<P>
Opponents argued that a constitutional amendment isn't necessary because Idaho
state law already defines marriage as being between a man and a woman.
Supporters say the amendment would prevent judges from overturning that
law.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the measure passed the House 53-17 vote.

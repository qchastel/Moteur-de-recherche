TEXAS LEGISLATION TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION BY BANNING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE FACES
HURDLE; 11 SENATORS EXPECTED TO HELP KILL MEASURE AUSTIN, Texas
-- Eleven senators, enough to kill any piece of legislation,
have told Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst they will oppose a
proposal to lock a ban on same-sex marriages into the
state constitution.
</P>
<P>
Dewhurst, nevertheless, said Thursday that he hoped the measure will win
Senate approval before the session adjourns 10 days from now.
</P>
<P>
The Senate State Affairs Committee, meanwhile, began a late-night hearing on
the measure. Committee approval would clear the way for a
showdown on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
As approved by the House, the measure would define marriage as
a union between one man and one woman and would
prohibit the state or any local government from creating or
recognizing "any legal status identical or similar to marriage," such
as civil unions.
</P>
<P>
Dewhurst said the proposal would strengthen the state's existing law against
homosexual marriages. Opponents argue that it is a discriminatory attack
on one group of people.
</P>
<P>
Kelly Schackelford of Dallas, president of the conservative Free Market Foundation,
said it was necessary to lock the ban into the
constitution to keep from having judicial challenges to the Texas
marriage law as is occurring in other states.
</P>
<P>
"Judges all over the country are doing an end run around
the people," he said. "That's a perversion of our democracy
and how our system is supposed to work."
</P>
<P>
Randall Ellis, executive director of the Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas,
said there are more than 43,000 same sex couples in
Texas, third behind New York and California.
</P>
<P>
"It is never right to allow the majority to decide the
rights of minorities," he said referring to the November election
that would be required to amend the constitution if the
Legislature approves the bill.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional amendments must be approved by two-thirds of the 31-member Senate,
or 21 senators. Eleven senators, if all hold firm, could
kill the measure. The Senate's operating procedure also requires a
two-thirds parliamentary vote to debate any legislation.
</P>
<P>
Dewhurst said he received a letter from 11 senators, asking that
the same-sex marriage ban not be brought to the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
"But I talked to several of the senators, and we'll see,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we probably will have the votes."
</P>
<P>
Dewhurst didn't identify the 11 senators or release copies of their
letter.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, who earlier this week used a parliamentary
"tag" to delay the committee hearing on the controversial proposal,
said he was one of the signers. But he also
declined to identify the others or say whether they included
both Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Juan Hinojosa, D-McAllen, said he also was among the 11
opponents. He called the proposal "a misguided solution for a
problem that doesn't even exist."
</P>
<P>
More than 200 witnesses testified against the ban in a committee
hearing in the House last month.

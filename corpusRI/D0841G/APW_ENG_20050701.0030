Spain becomes third nation to legalize gay marriage

MADRID, Spain

<P>
Parliament has legalized gay marriage, angering conservatives and clergy as it
made heavily Roman Catholic Spain the world's third country to grant full
recognition to same-sex couples, even letting them adopt children. Gay activists
wept with joy and thanked lawmakers by blowing them kisses.
</P>
<P>
The 350-seat Congress of Deputies approved the measure Thursday by a vote of
187-147 with four abstentions. The bill, a divisive plank in the ruling
Socialists' platform for social reform, gives homosexual couples the same rights
as heterosexual ones.
</P>
<P>
"Matrimony shall have the same requirements and effects regardless of whether
the persons involved are of the same or different sex," the bill
states.
</P>
<P>
Conservative opposition lawmakers said they might challenge the law in court,
while the church issued a veiled call for civil authorities who oppose gay
marriage to refuse to wed same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
The bill became law immediately. The Senate, where conservatives hold the
largest number of seats, rejected it last week, but that chamber is only an
advisory one and final say on legislation rests with the Congress of
Deputies.
</P>
<P>
Gay couples can get married as soon as the law is published in the official
government registry, which could happen as early as Friday or within two weeks
at the latest, parliament's press office said.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands and Belgium are the only other two countries that recognize gay
marriage nationwide. The former allows gays to adopt children, but Belgium so
far is just considering it. Canada's House of Commons passed legislation that
would legalize gay marriage by the end of July as long as the Senate also passes
the bill, which it is expected to do.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Massachusetts is the only state to recognize gay
marriage.
</P>
<P>
In debate before the vote, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said the
dry language of the Spanish reform masks "an immense change in the lives of
thousands of citizens. We are not legislating, ladies and gentlemen, for remote,
unknown people. We are expanding opportunities for the happiness of our
neighbors, our work colleagues, our friends, our relatives."
</P>
<P>
The Spanish Bishops Conference lashed out at the law, saying that with it and a
bill passed Wednesday making it easier for Spaniards to divorce, "marriage,
understood as the union of a man and a woman, is no longer provided for in our
laws."
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to oppose these unfair laws through all legitimate means," a
conference statement said, alluding to its hint last month that town hall
officials who oppose gay marriage should refuse to preside over such
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
After the final tally was announced, activists watching from the spectator
section of the ornate chamber cried and cheered, waving to lawmakers and blowing
them kisses.
</P>
<P>
Several members of the conservative opposition Popular Party, which vehemently
opposed the bill, shouted: "This is a disgrace."
</P>
<P>
Outside the stately 19th-century chamber, activists waved the rainbow flags
symbolizing the international gay rights movement.
</P>
<P>
"It is a historic day for the world's homosexuals. We have been fighting for
many years," said Beatriz Gimeno, a longtime leader of the gay rights movement
in Spain. "Now comes the hardest part, which is changing society's
mentality."
</P>
<P>
Oscar-winning Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar, who is gay, said
21st-century families are different and don't have to reflect the traditional
Catholic model.
</P>
<P>
"I don't like marriage. I am not going to get married. But it is important for
this to be called marriage so people know that it is the same thing for
everyone," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zapatero lacks a majority in the chamber but got more than enough help from
small regional-based parties that tend to be his allies.
</P>
<P>
Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy said Zapatero has deeply divided Spain and
should have sought a consensus in parliament that recognized same-sex unions but
didn't call them marriages. Rajoy said that if the vast majority of countries
don't accept gay marriage, including some run by Socialists, there must be a
reason.
</P>
<P>
"I think the prime minister has committed a grave act of irresponsibility,"
Rajoy said. He said his party is considering challenging the law before the
Constitutional Court, Spain's highest tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The gay marriage bill was the boldest and most divisive initiative of the
liberal social agenda Zapatero has embarked on since taking office in April
2004.
</P>
<P>
Under the divorce law reform, couples can end their marriage without a mandatory
separation period or having to state a reason, as required under the old
legislation. Zapatero has also pushed through legislation allowing stem-cell
research and wants to loosen Spain's restrictive abortion law.
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church, which held much sway over the government just a
generation ago when Gen. Francisco Franco was in power, adamantly opposed gay
marriage.
</P>
<P>
In its first display of anti-government activism in 20 years, it endorsed a June
18 rally in which hundreds of thousands of people marched through Madrid in
opposition to the bill. Some 20 bishops took part.
</P>
<P>
Still, polls suggest Spaniards support gay marriage. A survey released in May by
pollster Instituto Opina said 62 percent of Spaniards support the government's
action on gay marriage, and 30 percent oppose it. The poll had a margin of error
of 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
But surveys also show Spaniards about evenly split over whether gay couples
should be allowed to adopt children.

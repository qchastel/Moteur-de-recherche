<P>
Sweden's Lutheran Church on Thursday decided to let homosexual partners be
blessed in special church ceremonies but not in traditional weddings.
</P>
<P>
The issue has been debated since the secularized Scandinavian country recognized
civil unions for homosexual couples in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Church Assembly, the decision-making body for the Church of Sweden,
voted 160-81 to approve a blessing ceremony for same-sex partnerships.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has a liberal attitude toward homosexuals, but gay marriage is not yet
legal. Later this year a government-appointed committee is expected to file a
report on whether the law allowing civil unions between homosexuals should be
changed to include marriage as well.
</P>
<P>
More than 7 million of Sweden's 9 million inhabitants belong to the Church of
Sweden, but few attend church regularly.

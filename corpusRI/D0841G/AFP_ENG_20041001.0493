<P>
The Spanish government Friday approved plans for homosexual marriage,
including the right of gay couples to adopt, making the the country
the most liberal in Europe, with Belgium and the Netherlands, in the
field of gay rights.
</P>
<P>
A country-by-country review of current legislation:
</P>
<P>
- BELGIUM: Marriage between homosexuals became legal on June 1, 2003:
since February it also covers foreigners. For the union to be valid
one of the partners needs to be Belgian or to live in Belgium. Gay
couples have the same rights as heterosexual couples, in particular
insofar as inheritance and succession rights are concerned, but do
not have the right to adopt.
</P>
<P>
- NETHERLANDS: The Dutch Senate adopted in December 2000 legislation
authorising civil homosexual marriage and the adoption by two
same-sex parents of children provided the children have Dutch
nationality.
</P>
<P>
- NORTHERN EUROPE: Denmark was the first country in the world to
authorise (on October 1, 1989) a "registered partnership" between
gays. Homosexual couples have the same rights as heterosexual
partners, except in the areas of insemination and adoption.
</P>
<P>
Norway (1993), Sweden (1994), Iceland (1996) and Finland (2001)
followed suit. In all these countries the law gives gay couples the
same legal and social rights as married heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is the only one to authorise adoption (since February 2003).
In January Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen backed a
religious ceremony for gay couples.
</P>
<P>
- FRANCE: In October 1999 the Civil Pact of Solidarity (PACS) giving
legal status to non-married couples, in  UNITED NATIONS, Oct 1 (AFP)
- Lebanon and Syria have not met the demands in last month's UN
Security Council resolution calling for the respect of Lebanese
sovereignty, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a new report on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The requirements on the various parties set out in resolution 1559
have not been met," said the report, obtained by AFP.

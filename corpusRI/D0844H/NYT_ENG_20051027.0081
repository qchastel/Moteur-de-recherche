<P>
The withdrawal of Harriet E. Miers from Supreme Court
consideration was greeted Thursday with a blend of regret, relief
and a general feeling that she had not been treated
very well.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sad episode," said Sen. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania
Republican who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee and who not
long ago said Miers needed "a crash course in constitutional
law."
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not she would have been confirmed is an open
question," Specter said, voicing regret that Miers did not last
long enough for a committee hearing, where "she would have
had a major voice in determining her own future."
</P>
<P>
Democrats on the committee, while stopping far short of endorsing her,
nonetheless expressed sympathy for the erstwhile nominee.
</P>
<P>
"The right wing effectively killed this nomination," Sen. Dianne Feinstein of
California said on CNN. Feinstein said Miers "may not be
the best thing since sliced bread" as far as her
qualifications, but "I don't think she deserved the treatment she
got."
</P>
<P>
Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, another Judiciary Committee member,
said, "Harriet Miers is a fine and capable person, but
this was clearly the wrong position for her. Her gracious
withdrawal saves Harriet Miers and the nation from a difficult
and agonizing process and decision."
</P>
<P>
Some senators said Miers had been the victim of bad handling
by a White House that capitulated to people in the
far right wing of the Republican Party who doubted the
depth of her conservative beliefs.
</P>
<P>
Other senators, like Schumer, said the nomination had been bungled from
the start, and that President Bush should never have chosen
a person who was not qualified for the Supreme Court,
whatever her other legal credentials and personal attributes.
</P>
<P>
"This nominee deserved better," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a
committee member. While by no means indicating he would have
voted for her, Kennedy said he respected Miers: "She has
been a woman of achievement in her career."
</P>
<P>
The other Democrat from Massachusetts, Sen. John Kerry, said President Bush
had surrendered to "right wing interest groups" and let them
determine the fate of Miers. "This nomination was mishandled from
the beginning," said Kerry, who is not on the Judiciary
Committee. "The president nominated someone whose qualifications he alone knew,
then refused to disclose the only documents that would give
the Senate even a hint of his nominee's judicial philosophy."
</P>
<P>
Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, said, "Various groups, particularly on the Republican
side, didn't give her the opportunity to share why she's
qualified."
</P>
<P>
And Judge Robert H. Bork, who knows the pain of being
nominated for the Supreme Court and never getting there, said,
"We all have to have some sympathy for her."
</P>
<P>
Bork, who was rejected by the Senate in 1987, said in
a CNN interview that Miers had been nominated for a
position for which she was not really qualified. "I think
it was appropriate for her to withdraw," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fairly or not, the nomination of Miers was accompanied by charges
of cronyism. The White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, was asked
Thursday whether it was a safe bet that the president's
next choice would not be a White House employee.
</P>
<P>
"He will let you know who the next nominee is in
due course," McClellan replied.

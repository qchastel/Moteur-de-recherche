SUPREME COURT NOMINEE MIERS WITHDRAWS; JUSTICE ROBERTS SEEN AS MODEL TO FOLLOW
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With Harriet Miers' sudden withdrawal, President Bush likely will
choose a U.S. Supreme Court nominee who is conservative enough
to mend the rift with his Republican base and qualified
enough to fend off attacks from Democrats, experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In other words, regardless of gender or race, Bush may need
another John G. Roberts Jr. to replace retiring Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
"John Roberts was the closest thing to perfect you are going
to get," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of
the Senate Judiciary Committee that screens court nominees.
</P>
<P>
Bush promised to quickly name a replacement for Miers, the White
House counsel who served as Bush's former personal attorney and
president of the Texas Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
But with Bush's political troubles mounting, political and legal experts said
the president must make a careful choice if he is
to ease tensions and rally conservatives to his side. Bush's
public approval rating has sunk during the past few months
with the continuation of violence in Iraq, high gasoline prices
and the possibility that White House officials will be indicted
today after a grand jury investigation of the leak of
a CIA agent's identity.
</P>
<P>
Paul McGreal, a constitutional law professor at Houston's South Texas College
of Law, said Roberts is the model to follow.
</P>
<P>
"With Harriet Miers, people were objecting on two fronts: She just
didn't know enough about constitutional law, or there was not
enough record to evaluate that, and conservatives didn't think she
was one of them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"(Bush) needs to appoint someone with the public credentials of John
Roberts -- a background and a record that people could
look at and would have to say, 'Yeah, this person
is qualified.' But it also has to be someone who
could meet the other credential for conservatives: 'Is he one
of us?"'
</P>
<P>
Roberts, a conservative federal appeals court judge and a star appellate
lawyer who had argued 39 cases before the high court
-- and won 25 -- was confirmed last month to
succeed the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
His paper trail appeared to be short because he had served
on the bench only two years, but Roberts produced more
than 70,000 pages of written opinions, court briefs and other
work demonstrating his familiarity with a wide variety of constitutional
issues. In meetings with senators and in four days of
confirmation hearings, he wowed the Senate Judiciary Committee with his
grasp of complex legal issues and his ability to cite
from memory Supreme Court decisions and dissents.
</P>
<P>
Miers, on the other hand, is an accomplished corporate and government
lawyer who has never been a judge and has rarely
argued cases before appellate courts. There are no opinions and
very few legal briefs that could be used to assess
her qualifications for the high court.
</P>
<P>
Miers said in a letter to the president that she was
withdrawing to avoid burdening the White House with a struggle
over access to documents on the advice she gave Bush
as his government lawyer. Senators indicated they would ask for
the documents to help them gauge her qualifications, and Bush
said this week he would refuse to provide them because
they amounted to privileged information.
</P>
<P>
But beyond the issue of executive privilege, Miers faced attacks from
conservative Republicans from the day of her nomination. They accused
Bush of cronyism and betrayal for picking his longtime friend
over more solidly conservative candidates with stronger legal credentials.
</P>
<P>
Though no senator of either party had declared an intention to
vote against her, Miers evidently concluded that her confirmation was
unlikely -- or could be won only at severe personal
cost.
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing," said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, "that this good person,
that by any fair account is highly qualified, was not
even given a chance for a hearing."
</P>
<P>
"This has been painful and difficult for everybody," said Wendy E.
Long, counsel to the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network, which has
worked to get Bush's past nominees confirmed but sat this
one out.
</P>
<P>
"We initially tried to point out her virtues as a person,
which we still stand by," Long said, "but the problem
was there wasn't a whole lot to go on, or
a whole lot in her record to fight with."
</P>
<P>
Long urged Bush to keep his campaign promise and select a
nominee in the model of Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
"He campaigned twice for president and was very clear about what
he was going to do, so it's no state secret,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Asked who he would like to see nominated, Cornyn replied, "Anybody
but me."
</P>
<P>
Bush and others have said they want wide representation on the
Supreme Court -- a rationale for appointing a woman or
a minority to replace O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
But most experts said it's more important for the president to
pick an intellectually qualified nominee.
</P>
<P>
"My view is that there was zero pressure to appoint a
woman or a minority when he appointed Harriet Miers," said
Long. "If the pressure was zero then, now it's utterly
nonexistent."
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the only woman on the Judiciary Committee,
said it would be "a tremendous mistake" to appoint another
member of the administration.
</P>
<P>
"It creates a perceived conflict," she said. "Somebody has to have
either the ability to entirely cut the umbilical cord or
have no cord there in the first place."

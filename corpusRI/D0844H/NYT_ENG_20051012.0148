President Bush on Wednesday moved religion to the forefront
of the debate over Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers, defending
his administration's work behind the scenes to inform social conservatives
about her Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
"People ask me why I picked Harriet Miers," Bush said. "They
want to know Harriet Miers' background. They want to know
as much as they possibly can before they form opinions.
And part of Harriet Miers' life is her religion."
</P>
<P>
Bush's remarks appeared to further inflame the controversy over the nomination.
Some conservatives and religious leaders complained that the president's rationale
failed to address their core objections: that Miers is not
qualified and her nomination looks like cronyism.
</P>
<P>
"Do not patronize us by assuming that we will immediately support
Ms. Miers as a Supreme Court justice because we hear
she is an evangelical Christian," said the Rev. Patrick J.
Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition, a religious pro-life
group.
</P>
<P>
The injection of religion also drew fire from critics who noted
that the White House had scrupulously guarded the nomination process
of Chief Justice John Roberts from questions about his Roman
Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
Bush was defending attempts in recent days by Vice President Dick
Cheney, political adviser Karl Rove and White House insiders, such
as former Republican Party Chairman Ed Gillespie, to reassure social
and religious conservatives about Miers' faith and conservatism.
</P>
<P>
Those moves seemed to create a new class of critic among
some legal scholars, who questioned whether religious leaders such as
Focus on the Family's James Dobson, who had been personally
contacted by Rove ahead of Miers' nomination, should have a
voice in the process.
</P>
<P>
"The president and his aides can consult whomever they wish. But
the process of choosing a Supreme Court justice should be
based on merit and, of course, understanding of and loyalty
to the Constitution," said Erwin Chemerinsky, professor of law at
Duke University. "The blessing of the religious right should not
determine a person's suitability to serve on the Supreme Court."
</P>
<P>
In defense of Miers, Bush has employed several strategies to build
support.
</P>
<P>
But despite those efforts, a drumbeat in favor of withdrawing her
nomination continued gathering strength among conservative activists and opinion leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Most conservatives, I think, want Bush to succeed and would be
eager to mend fences with a new nominee," said Jonah
Goldberg, a conservative columnist at the National Review.
</P>
<P>
A critic of the Miers nomination, Goldberg called Bush's statements about
her faith "unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem with him picking an evangelical Christian or
putting stock in a nominee's faith as an insurance policy
against 'drift' toward the liberal cosmopolitanism we've seen from some
on the court," Goldberg said. "But such insurance policies aren't
reliable."
</P>
<P>
A new poll from the Pew Research Center highlighted the issue
of cronyism, with 41 percent saying they believe Bush "offers
important jobs to his friends and political allies"more than earlier
presidents. Nine percent said Bush did it less, while 44
percent said other presidents gave their friends top jobs as
much as Bush does.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, appearing on Fox News Channel to defend
the Miers nomination, dismissed charges of cronyism and predicted that
she will be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you should be disqualified from being considered for
an important position simply because you have a relationship with
the person making the decision on who to nominate," he
said. "You have to look first at a person's qualifications."
</P>
<P>
Adding to the White House woes over Miers, first lady Laura
Bush, a popular figure frequently deployed by the administration to
generate public support and good will, sparked her own mini-furor
when she speculated that sexism may be fueling some of
the opposition to Miers.
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Democrats and liberal advocacy groups have stayed
out of the fray, biding their time while Bush gets
knocked off message by members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
The Miers nomination presents a tricky choice for Democrats, who could
either try to defeat her and risk Bush choosing a
more conservative nominee, or support her and sacrifice the chance
to use her nomination and related issues such as cronyism
against Republicans in the 2006 midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
Signaling the party's intent to fight, Ralph Neas, president of the
liberal People for the American Way, expressed outrage about what
he called the administration's double standard in bringing religion into
the Miers' debate after refusing to allow Roberts' Catholicism to
become an issue in his confirmation.
</P>
<P>
"It's hypocrisy, doubled and quadrupled," Neas said. "Whether they're shouting it
from the rooftops or whispering into the ears of their
right-wing supporters, Miers' personal religious beliefs should have no place
in her nomination."

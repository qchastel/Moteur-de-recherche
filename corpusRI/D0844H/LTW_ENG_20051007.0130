President Bush Friday rejected conservative calls to
withdraw his nomination of White House counsel Harriet Miers to the
Supreme Court and prepared to reassure skeptical Republicans and
persuade the Senate to confirm her for the seat of retiring Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.

Bush advisers who once anticipated all-out war with Democrats over
his attempts to reshape the Supreme Court have had to recalibrate
their strategy to battle an insurrection among Republicans who contend
the president was obligated to nominate a top-flight legal figure with
an unmistakably conservative pedigree.

At every point where the White House has hoped it might have turned
the corner, it has run into more flak from the right. Just Friday,
columnist Charles Krauthammer and Weekly Standard editor William
Kristol called on Bush to withdraw the Miers nomination, with
Krauthammer deriding her selection as ``scandalous'' and ``a joke.''
Another icon of the conservative movement, former Judge Robert H.
Bork, denounced it as ``a disaster on every level.''

The president made it clear Friday that he has no intention of
backing down. Asked about the calls to withdraw the nomination, he
said, ``No, she is going to be on the bench, she'll be confirmed. And
when she's on the bench, people will see a fantastic woman who is
honest, open, humble and capable of being a great Supreme Court
judge.''

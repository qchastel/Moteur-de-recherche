<P>
President George W. Bush on Monday nominated White House counsel Harriet Miers
to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court, reaching
into his loyal inner circle for a pick that could reshape the nation's judiciary
for years to come.
</P>
<P>
"She has devoted her life to the rule of law and the cause of justice," Bush
said, announcing his choice from the Oval Office with Miers at his side. "She
will be an outstanding addition to the Supreme Court of the United
States."
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, Miers, 60, would join Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the nation's highest court and the
third to serve there. Miers, who has never been a judge, was the first woman to
serve as president of the Texas State Bar and the Dallas Bar
Association.

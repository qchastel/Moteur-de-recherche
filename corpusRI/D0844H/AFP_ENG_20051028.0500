Bush faces delicate Supreme Court nomination after Miers

<P>
US President George W. Bush faces a 
delicate balancing act in nominating a new Supreme Court justice who 
will appeal to the religious right but not spark fierce Democratic 
opposition, following Harriet Miers's abrupt withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Bush has said he will move "quickly" to select another candidate 
for America's highest court, after Miers withdrew from the process 
Thursday amid a firestorm of opposition from right-wing lawmakers 
and religious groups.
</P>
<P>
Rattled by a CIA leak scandal that has targeted a top White 
House aide, and taking fire on Iraq and his administration's 
response to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Bush must confound 
suggestions of weakness and perceptions that his power is already 
ebbing, according to political analysts.
</P>
<P>
A Bush administration official, who requested anonymity, said 
the White House has gone back to reviewing a potential list of 
nominees that it had mulled before the president announced Miers as 
his pick on October 3.
</P>
<P>
Her nomination had run into trouble on Capitol Hill, where 
lawmakers suggested she lacked the votes necessary for confirmation 
to the United States' highest court.
</P>
<P>
Even lawmakers in Bush's own Republican Party had questioned 
Miers's conservative credentials and grasp of constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
Miers, Bush's White House counsel and a former Texas lawyer, 
said in a letter to Bush that she had withdrawn her nomination in 
order to protect the independence of the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
"I have steadfastly maintained that the independence of the 
executive branch be preserved and its confidential documents and 
information not be released to further a confirmation process," she 
said in the letter released to the media.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court justices must be approved by the Senate, after 
being nominated by a US president, before they can take a seat on 
the court.
</P>
<P>
A vacancy opened up on the court after Justice Sandra Day 
O'Connor announced her retirement from the nine-member bench. 
O'Connor has said she will stay on until a new justice has been 
approved to take her post.
</P>
<P>
Conservatives said Bush will now have to come up with a 
"winnable conservative nominee" for the court.
</P>
<P>
"The flow of blood has been stanched," said David Keene, 
chairman of the American Conservative Union.
</P>
<P>
"If he (Bush) comes up with a winnable conservative nominee, 
even if that person faces a fight in Congress, he will have drawn 
his people back to him," Keene noted.
</P>
<P>
Other conservatives said Miers's failed nomination had shown how 
out of touch the Republican president was with some of his key 
political supporters.
</P>
<P>
"What has come out of this episode is how really out of touch 
Mr. Bush is with the intellectual foundations of the movement that 
he purports to represent," said Roger Pilon, director of the Center 
for Constitutional Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.
</P>
<P>
Some Supreme Court watchers, meanwhile, said Bush might have 
even less of a choice this time around as he vies to appoint a 
successful candidate to the court.
</P>
<P>
"The president appears to have less flexibility about what he 
does next, and the moderate Republican senators probably gain some 
power to determine the fate of a new nominee. The Democrats, on the 
other hand, may not realize much advantage, if any," the 
Scotusblog.com website said in a posting.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi played down Miers's 
failed nomination.
</P>
<P>
"Let's move on," he urged, adding: "In a month, who will 
remember the name Harriet Miers?"

Conservative Tactics On Miers May Roil Future Nominations

<P>
Conservative activists crippled Harriet Miers's
Supreme Court nomination largely by challenging her judicial
philosophy, debating the importance of her religious beliefs,
demanding to see White House documents and derailing her before she
reached a Senate vote. Those tactics might make it harder for them to
defend President Bush's next pick, expected by many to be a solid
conservative, according to a number of Democrats, independent analysts
and even some conservative commentators.
</P>
<P>
They are struck by differences between the Miers nomination process
and that of John Roberts, who was confirmed as chief justice a month
ago. When liberals mentioned a possible filibuster of Roberts,
Republicans insisted on an ``up-or-down vote,'' which Miers never
received. Virtually all GOP senators defended the White House's
refusal to surrender documents concerning Roberts, but some of them
demanded comparable documents regarding Miers.
</P>
<P>
And whereas Republicans said Roberts's religious beliefs should not
be a subject of Senate inquiry, Bush cited Miers's church affiliation
and religious convictions as one of her chief qualifications. Now the
Democrats may be in a stronger position to wage a filibuster or demand
more detailed documentation and explanation of the next nominee's
positions if they conclude he or she is out of the judicial
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
``The Republican senators are changing every rule they attempted to
set'' in the Roberts confirmation, said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
the Judiciary Committee's most senior member. ``They flip-flopped on
whether judicial philosophy and religious beliefs are appropriate''
topics of Senate probing, he said. ``And they flip-flopped on whether
Harriet Miers deserved an up-or-down vote.''
</P>
<P>
Marcia Greenberger, founder of the National Women's Law Center,
said: ``I don't know how people can, with a straight face, make some
of the same arguments they made in the Roberts nomination after what
they said so vociferously with Miers.''
</P>
<P>
Some conservatives agree. Commentator Hugh Hewitt, in a New York
Times op-ed column Friday, noted that several Senate Republicans
campaigned in 2002 and 2004 on the ``up-or-down vote'' issue for
judicial nominees. ``Now, with the withdrawal of Harriet Miers under
an instant, fierce and sometimes false assault from conservative
pundits and activists, it will be difficult for Republican candidates
to continue to make this winning argument: that Democrats have deeply
damaged the integrity of the advice and consent process,'' wrote
Hewitt, a law professor at Chapman University in California.
</P>
<P>
Many of his fellow conservatives reject this argument. ``Harriet
Miers was heading toward an up-or-down vote'' when she decided to
withdraw, said Brian McCabe, president of Progress for America, which
backed Roberts and Miers. He said there was no talk of a filibuster --
in which 40 of the Senate's 100 members can prevent a question from
reaching a vote.
</P>
<P>
Nan Aron of the liberal Alliance for Justice disagrees. Key
Republican senators working quietly with the White House
``orchestrated the withdrawal'' of Miers, she said. ``They can no
longer say that up-or-down votes are necessary in every situation,''
and that will undercut the argument that a Democratic-led filibuster
is out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
As for executive branch documents, the White House invoked
attorney-client privilege for both Roberts and Miers, conservatives
noted. But Democrats say it was GOP senators who were inconsistent.
They note that Sens. David Vitter, R-La., Sam Brownback, R-Kan.,
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and others called on the Bush administration
to divulge more Miers-related documents than it was willing to yield.
</P>
<P>
Bush's emphasis on Miers's religious convictions is more
problematic for some conservatives. ``There were a lot of criticisms
of that,'' conceded Ed Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public
Policy Center, a conservative think tank that criticized Miers. ``Some
were put in a box trying to come up with arguments to sustain the
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, he said, conservatives have argued that a
judicial nominee's religious beliefs should not be seen as a predictor
of court rulings. Whelan said Democrats will have little success if
they try to score points on this issue in next confirmation fight.
</P>
<P>
But the liberal group People for the American Way already is
trying. Until recently, it said, the Republican right contended ``that
inquiring about a nominee's religious views was off-limits'' and
``there should be no abortion 'litmus test' for confirmation. ... But
shortly after the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court,
the Right all but abandoned these 'principles.' ''
</P>
<P>
Some legal scholars say conservative activists and their Senate
allies might have to explain why they pressed to know Miers's views on
abortion and why they were openly troubled by her comments about
``self-determination'' concerning school prayer and other issues. ``A
lot of Republicans have put ideology on the table now by saying
Harriet Miers wasn't a true conservative and by objecting that she
wasn't clearly opposed to Roe vs. Wade,'' said Cass Sunstein, a
constitutional law expert at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Whelan said Roberts easily handled these questions by showing he
had a basically conservative outlook and a solid grasp of
constitutional issues. Bush's next pick presumably will have similar
traits, he said.
</P>
<P>
``The lesson from this experience is how important it is to have
someone with an objectively discernible judicial philosophy, and a
sound one,'' Whelan said. As for all the accusations of hypocrisy, he
said, ``Democrats may blow some smoke based on this, but I don't think
there's any substance to it.''

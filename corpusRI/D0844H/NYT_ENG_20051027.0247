HARRIET MIERS SHOCKS SOME OF HER FRIENDS BY SAYING SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THE U.S. SUPREME COURT

<P>
Saddened and surprised, friends and associates of Harrier
Miers' in Texas blamed harsh attacks by the Christian conservatives,
along with a bungled White House strategy to sell with
her nomination, with sinking the Dallas attorney's nomination to the
nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very proud of Harriet and at the same time
sorry for her," said Darrell Jordan, a Dallas attorney. "She
is the most decent and honorable person in the world,
and to have it end like this is very disappointing."
</P>
<P>
In Washington last week to stump for Miers with the Senate
Judiciary Committee, Jordan said the White House committed several "gaffes,"
including touting Miers' religious background to appease Christian conservatives who
criticized Bush's nomination.
</P>
<P>
"I wondered from the beginning why they were taking that approach.
It was a risky strategy," Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
Molly Steele, a former Dallas Bar Association president who worked with
Miers, said she was sorry that her friend would not
be allowed to bring her considerable legal skills as a
trial attorney to the court.
</P>
<P>
"I think she would have been imminently fair and reasonable. She
would have been a centralist vote like (Supreme Court Justice)
Sandra Day O'Connor," Steele said. "It is obvious the next
appointee could be a right-wing ideologue like the base of
the Republican Party wants."
</P>
<P>
At Locke Liddell &amp; Sapp, the massive Dallas law firm where
Miers worked before moving to Washington in 2001, the front
lobby was virtually empty, the mood seemed somber.
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed that our friend and colleague ... has withdrawn her
nomination to be a justice on the Supreme Court of
the United States, and that she never received a fair
hearing," said a spokeswoman for the firm, Julie Gilbert, reading
from a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
"Harriet Miers has led a distinguished career, has an impeccable reputation,
was extremely qualified and would have served the American people
well," Gilbert said from the law firm's offices in Houston.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud of all Harriet Miers did for this law
firm ... Professionally and personally, she remains a role model
for us all," she said.
</P>
<P>
Cathie Adams of Dallas, president of the conservative group Texas Eagle
Forum, credited Miers for doing "the right thing" by withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
"I think that she is not a conservative, ideologically," Adams said,
"and I am disappointed in her embracing of too many
facets of the feminist agenda, gender quotas in particular."
</P>
<P>
Adams said federal appeals court Judges Janice Rogers Brown and Edith
Hollan Jones both have "conservative paper trails" suitable for nomination
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
But, Adams said she would also support "another qualified gentleman because
I don't think we have to have a gender quota."
</P>
<P>
Bush nominated Miers to the court a little more than three
weeks ago, immediately angering members of the Christian right who
said Bush had promised them a conservative court nominee in
the mold of Supreme Court justices Clarence Thomas or Antonin
Scalia.
</P>
<P>
Republicans and Democrats complained about her lack of judicial experience, and
members of the Judiciary Committee sharply criticized Miers for not
completely answering a questionnaire about her work at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
The administration made available about 9,000 pages of documents from Miers'
tenure on the Dallas City Council and the Texas Lottery
Commission, and Miers friends responded by pointing to her record
as a "trailblazer."
</P>
<P>
Miers was the first woman hired by Lock Purnell Boren Laney
&amp; Neely, a blue-chip Dallas law firm with roots back
to the late 1800s. She later became that firms managing
partner, overseeing a team of more than 400 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
She also was the first woman president of the Dallas Bar
Association in 1983, and the first woman president of the
State Bar of Texas in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
During her work with those groups and the American Bar Association,
Miers earned high marks for reaching out to women and
minorities and for working to improve legal services to the
poor.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who ever worked with her knew she was fair," Jordan
said.
</P>
<P>
An outstanding lawyer and person, Miers would have been a fine
Supreme Court justice, said Derek Davis, director of the J.M.
Dawson Institute of Church-State Studies at Baylor University.
</P>
<P>
Davis is an attorney who used to practice a few floors
away from Miers.
</P>
<P>
He blamed "ultra conservatives" with destroying Miers' nomination because they insisted
on having a justice that would change social policy in
two areas: abortion and the trend of accepting homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
"They feel like they put George Bush into office and this
was part of his promise -- to revamp the court.
But he's not revamping it in the way they want,"
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
Steele was on her way to breakfast with a friend Thursday
when she heard that Miers had dropped out. She said
she had not yet talked to her friend.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm going to call and leave her a message and
say we still love her and leave it at that,"
Steele said.

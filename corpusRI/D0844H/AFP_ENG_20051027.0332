WASHINGTON, Oct 27
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US President George W. Bush announced 
Thursday that his choice to fill a US Supreme Court vacancy, Harriet 
Miers, had withdrawn her nomination.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I have reluctantly accepted Harriet Miers's decision to 
withdraw her nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States," 
he said in a statement, adding: "My responsibility to fill this 
vacancy remains. I will do so in a timely manner."
</P>
<P>
The surprise withdrawal of Miers's nomination comes just over 
three weeks after she was recommended for the high-profile legal 
post by Bush on October 3.
</P>
<P>
Miers's nomination had run into trouble on Capitol Hill, where 
lawmakers suggested she lacked the votes necessary for confirmation 
to the United States' highest court.
</P>
<P>
And even lawmakers in Bush's own Republican Party had questioned 
Miers's conservative credentials and grasp of constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
Miers said in a letter to Bush that she had withdrawn her 
nomination in order to protect the independence of the executive 
branch.
</P>
<P>
"I have steadfastly maintained that the independence of the 
executive branch be preserved and its confidential documents and 
information not be released to further a confirmation process," she 
said in a letter to Bush released to the media.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers had requested internal White House documents in 
order to review Miers's legal background and get some insight into 
her philosophy.
</P>
<P>
Miers also highlighted her concern that "the confirmation 
process presents a burden for the White House and our staff that is 
not in the best interest of the country".
</P>
<P>
Bush said his White House counsel will continue to serve him in 
that post following her abrupt withdrawal.

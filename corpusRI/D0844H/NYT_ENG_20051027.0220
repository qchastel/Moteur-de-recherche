MIERS DESERVED BETTER HEARING THAN SHE GOT

<P>
Bad timing. In other circumstances, President George W.
Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers for the U.S. Supreme Court
might have gone through without a blip.
</P>
<P>
The first woman president of the Dallas and Texas bar associations,
she was seen as heading toward the presidency of the
American Bar Association, before she went to the White House.
The first woman hired by a prestigious Dallas law firm,
she rose to become its first woman president. She was
listed by the National Law Journal as one of the
50 most influential woman lawyers in the country.
</P>
<P>
The credentials seemed to be there, and she was a friend
of the president.
</P>
<P>
But in these hyper-ideological times -- with the court's direction hanging
in the balance -- and with cronyism charges swirling around
Mr. Bush, things didn't go right.
</P>
<P>
Some complained about Ms. Miers' qualifications: She hadn't been a judge
or written law review articles. This seemed to be the
respectable way for rigid conservatives to highlight the fact that
she wasn't on record as favoring their agenda.
</P>
<P>
When that attack started, she had few defenders, because people across
the political spectrum wanted to know more about her views
before getting on board.
</P>
<P>
And she didn't help herself. She filled out a background form
for the Senate in a way that insulted leaders of
both parties. Her private meetings with senators were reported to
be superficial. She and Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter, a crucial
player, disagreed about what she told him in their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Finally, on Wednesday, an old speech came to light in which
she suggested that the courts should not get into private
lives, but should honor "self-determination." That was a big problem
with anti-abortion people.
</P>
<P>
They pushed President Bush to give up. He did. The White
House pretended that Ms. Miers' stepping aside stems from a
fight about whether the White House should have to turn
over papers that it doesn't want to release. But that's
a transparent cover.
</P>
<P>
When the nomination was first announced the president's selection of a
person without a record on hot-button topics seemed a smart
way to avoid a knockdown battle. But he didn't count
on the ideological fixation of some of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
Now things are worse. Now that conservatives have essentially exercised a
veto, Democrats must feel more free to do the same,
which could mean a filibuster. With conservatives having trashed a
nominee on the grounds of qualifications and having achieved the
withdrawal they wanted even before hearings, they can hardly make
the case that every nominee deserves an up-or-down vote; and
they can hardly complain about personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
What kind of philosophy a Justice Harriet Miers would have followed
is not clear. She seems to have changed her mind
over the years on some big issues. But the case
that she would not be a rigid ideologue was looking
stronger as time went by. That would have been good
for the country.
</P>
<P>
Maybe, however, she wasn't the right person for the extraordinary test
she faced. This, after all, is the fight that the
left and right have been girding for. Few people could
handle the pressure perfectly.
</P>
<P>
Next.

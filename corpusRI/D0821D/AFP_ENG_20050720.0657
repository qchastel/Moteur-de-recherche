Two men were arrested Wednesday on 
suspicion of having set fire to a mosque in northwest England two 
days after the London bombings, police said.
</P>
<P>
One man had to be rescued by firefighters when the blaze broke 
out at the Shahjalal Mosque in Birkenhead, Merseyside, in the early 
hours of July 9, two days after the bomb attacks on three subway 
trains and a bus in London.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that the blaze may have been started in retaliation 
for the London bombings, which claimed the lives of at least 56 
people.

"A 28-year-old man and a 29-year-old man, who both come from 
Birkenhead, have been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to 
endanger life," a Merseyside Police spokeswoman said, adding that 
the two were being questioned.
</P>
<P>
One man has already been charged with arson in connection with 
the incident.

Stephen Wynne, 27, from Birkenhead, appeared before Wirral 
Magistrates last Friday and was remanded in custody to appear before 
Liverpool Crown Court on August 4.

The same weekend police also reported arson attacks on mosques 
in Leeds, Belvedere, and Telford.

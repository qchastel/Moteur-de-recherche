Londoners Get on the Bus Day After Transit Bombings
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Passengers returned to the city's subway trains and buses
Friday, giving London some sense of normality, even as police
announced that the death toll from Thursday's bombing attacks had
reached at least 50.
</P>
<P>
Police also said that an unknown number of bodies still lay in the
ruins of a subway car trapped in a darkened tunnel on the system's
Piccadilly Line. The tunnel was made unsafe, they said, by damage from
the bomb blast there.
</P>
<P>
London's perpetually busy streets, emptied since the attacks that
blew apart three subway cars and a double-decker bus, were busy again,
though the legendary traffic jams were eased by some people deciding
to take the day off.
</P>
<P>
There was still plenty of grieving to do.
</P>
<P>
In scenes reminiscent of the attacks on the United States on Sept.
11, 2001, and in Madrid, Spain, on March 11, 2004, relatives and
friends of the missing searched hospitals, posted fliers and took to
the airwaves begging for information.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Scotland Yard did not disclose how many of the dead
remain unidentified, but they were more than a few.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were not even certain how many bodies remained
unretrieved. And the explosion on the bus was so severe it took more
than a full day merely to determine the number of people killed by it:
13.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said 22 of the 700 people injured remained in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
Sir Ian Blair, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, said that
investigators were committed to finding the attackers, and he promised
the most extensive investigation and manhunt in the department's
history.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have said they do not know who they are looking for
or how many suspects. They said they have begun to review streams of
video shot by some of the hundreds of cameras that record activity on
subway platforms and streets around London.
</P>
<P>
Forensic evidence indicates that the bombs each contained less than
10 pounds of high explosives -- the Madrid bombs weighed 17 to 22
pounds -- which could have kept them small enough to fit in rucksacks,
Commissioner Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He promised Londoners that his department would not tire in its
search for the killers: ``We will bend every sinew of the Metropolitan
Police and all our associated agencies and comrades to do that.''
</P>
<P>
Even Queen Elizabeth II, who rarely makes public statements and
even more rarely says anything mildly provocative, addressed workers
at the Royal London Hospital in East London in a speech that was
televised nationwide.
</P>
<P>
She first spoke admiringly of how Londoners handled themselves
during the attacks and immediately after, remaining remarkably calm
during a morning that could have devolved into chaos but remained far
from it.
</P>
<P>
And she was impressed by their resolve, she said, for being
``calmly determined to resume their normal lives.''
</P>
<P>
Then, in a stern tone, she reminded the country in a message that
might have been directed at the attackers, that Britain survived the
German bombing campaigns of World War II with its character intact and
that it would prevail again, and always.
</P>
<P>
``Atrocities such as these simply reinforce our sense of community,
our humanity, our trust in the rule of law,'' the queen said. ``That
is the clear message from us all.''
</P>
<P>
Scotland Yard said its investigation has determined that the three
subway blasts came from bombs left on the floor, not seats. No
evidence exists that suicide bombers were involved in the attacks on
the trains, according to Blair, the commissioner, but he was less
certain about how the bomb on the bus was detonated.
</P>
<P>
Police investigator Andy Hayman said forensic investigators had not
determined the location of the explosive device on the bus, which blew
apart near Tavistock Square in the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
Recovery workers were prevented from getting to a subway train on
which 22 people died between the King's Cross and Russell Square
stations on the Piccadilly Line.
</P>
<P>
While all the blast survivors have been removed by rescuers,
investigators could not reach the train until midafternoon Friday
because the tunnel walls were damaged and are considered unstable.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner linked the tactics of the bombers to the
``hallmarks of al-Qaida,'' but he said he had no evidence to support
the connection.
</P>
<P>
Subway stations where the attacks hit remained closed, cordoned off
as crime zones, and several security alerts briefly shut down stations
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair said at a news conference at the close of
the Group of Eight summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, that ``these people
who have inflicted the politics of terror on people have no support in
any democratic way,'' adding, ``That is why they engage in
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
The prime minister scoffed at a reporter's suggestion that the
authorities might have in some way failed by not preventing the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
``Those people who killed the innocent and caused such bloodshed,''
he said, ``they're solely responsible.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, said the city's emergency services
had once run an exercise to prepare for the possibility of multiple
explosions during rush hour on the public transport system. Thanks in
part to that exercise, he said, during the real disaster ``we cannot
think of a single thing that failed to work.''
</P>
<P>
``I say to those who planned this dreadful attack, whether they are
here in hiding, or somewhere abroad: Watch next week as we bury our
dead and mourn them,'' Livingstone said. ``But see also, in those same
days, new people coming to this city, to make it their home to call
themselves Londoners and doing it because of that freedom to be
themselves.''

<P>
The final death toll from the July 7 
London bombings still stands at 56, but might still rise due to the 
"very difficult" scenes at the blast sites, interior minister 
Charles Clarke said Wednesday.

All 56 people confirmed as having died when bombs exploded on 
three London Underground subway trains and a bus had now been 
formally identified, Clarke told the House of Commons.

"It is possible that the total may rise as the police 
investigation of the very difficult scenes continues," he added.

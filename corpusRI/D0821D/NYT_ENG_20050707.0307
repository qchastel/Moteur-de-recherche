Bomb explosions tore through three subway trains and a
red double-decker bus in a coordinated terror attack during London's
morning rush hour on Thursday, killing at least 37 people,
injuring about 700 and leaving the city stunned, bloodied but
oddly stoic.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, London bubbled over with joy at winning the 2012
Olympics. On Thursday, commuters on the city's subways were plunged
into the nightmare of a subterranean bloodbath, when an explosion
tore through a subway train 100 yards into the tunnel
at Liverpool Street Station at 8:51 a.m., according to a
police chronology. Seven people died.
</P>
<P>
The next explosion occurred at 8:56 a.m. near King's Cross Station,
where the death toll was 21, the police said. Twenty-one
minutes later, at 9:17 a.m., a third blast ripped through
a train coming in Edgware Road underground station, killing seven.
</P>
<P>
Above ground, at 9:47 a.m., an explosion tore open the roof
of a No. 30 double-decker bus with such force that
it threw debris three yards into the air. The blast,
at the junction of Upper Woburn Place and Tavistock Place,
was so powerful that it took hours to determine that
two people had died.
</P>
<P>
The entire subway network was closed as rescue workers went deep
below ground to look for the dead and wounded. Police
in yellow slickers sealed off streets and bus services were
halted.

"It is reasonably clear that there have been a series of
terrorist attacks in London," a shaken-looking Prime Minister Tony Blair
told reporters before he left the Group of Eight summit
meeting he was hosting at Gleneagles, Scotland. The attack, he
said, was timed to coincide with the summit meeting. He
flew back to London lead emergency ministerial meetings here, leaving
the other seven leaders -- including President Bush -- for
several hours.
</P>
<P>
A group called Secret al-Qaida Jihad Organization in Europe claimed responsibility,
saying the attacks were undertaken to avenge British involvement in
the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were the worst in British memory since World War
II.
</P>
<P>
Some of the wounded were ferried to hospitals swathed in silvery
space blankets, their faces blackened with soot. The police said
seriously injured people had lost limbs and were badly burned.
</P>
<P>
Yusuf Pandor, 40, of North West London was looking to return
to his car on the other side of the barriers.
Just more than an hour earlier, he was one of
many Samaritans helping pull bombing victims into the nearby Hilton
Metropol.
</P>
<P>
"They were shaken, bleeding," Pador said. "One woman was badly injured
-- burned on her face. She had it covered. People
were just shocked."
</P>
<P>
Loyita Worley, who works for a London law firm, told the
BBC that she was in the subway when an explosion
took place in the next carriage, while it was in
a tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Worley, 49, said: "All the lights went out and the train
came to an immediate halt. There was smoke everywhere and
everyone was coughing and choking, but remained calm. We couldn't
open the doors."
</P>
<P>
By evening some parts of the city were eerily calm, the
usually thronged streets around some railroad stations cordoned off and
empty while thousands of people packed the sidewalks, stranded by
the lack of public transportation, seeking ways home.

LONDON, July 19
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The British authorities on Tuesday began 
removing a London Underground car which was hit in one of the four 
bombings carried out nearly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
British television stations showed the car being lifted by a 
crane from the track near Edgware Road Underground station and moved 
toward a flatbed truck.
</P>
<P>
It had been winched out of the tunnel at the station where the 
explosion happened on July 7, killing seven people, police said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 56 people were killed in the attacks on three subway 
trains and one bus.
</P>
<P>
The sealed car will be transported to a secure police compound 
for further forensic examination, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage, weighing around 20 tonnes, is all that remains of 
the carriage second from the front of the targeted train. The bomb 
was located in a standing area near the first set of double doors, 
police have said.
</P>
<P>
Since the explosion, police have been working to remove all the 
bodies of the victims before the car could be taken away.
</P>
<P>
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the removal was being 
carried out by contractors for Transport for London.
</P>
<P>
It signals that the forensic search of the scene of the bombing 
is nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said: "Until today it has been a full crime scene 
so everything has remained as it was. There has been removal of 
bodies.
</P>
<P>
"They have pulled the carriage out of the tunnel. It's on an 
open spot. They will drop a winch down and drop it (the car) onto 
the back of the flatbed lorry. It will be moved to a location for 
further forensic evidence."
</P>
<P>
He said the damage was not so extensive that the carriage was 
unrecognisable.

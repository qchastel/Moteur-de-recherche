LONDON, July 12
</DATELINE>

<P>
The intensive hunt for the perpetrators 
of the London bombings dramatically gathered pace Tuesday, centering 
on a gritty industrial city in the north of England.
</P>
<P>
Five premises in Leeds -- home to a large Muslim population of 
south Asian origin -- were raided by police armed with warrants 
issued under the Terrorism Act 2000, police said.
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Ian Blair called the 
operation in the West Yorkshire city "significant," as Sky News 
television reported that several arrests had been carried out.
</P>
<P>
Citing police sources, Sky News added that four of the bombers 
were among the 52 confirmed dead in Thursday's bombing of three 
Underground subway trains and a double-decker bus.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate confirmation of the reports from police, 
but there was little doubt that the investigation into the bloodiest 
attack on British soil since World War II was moving fast.
</P>
<P>
Closer to London, police sealed off a train station and parking 
lot in Luton, northwest of the capital, to recover a car that might 
offer up clues into the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Islamic extremists, possibly with links to Osama bin Laden's 
Al-Qaeda network, are believed to have carried out the bombings.
</P>
<P>
With daily life in London virtually back to normal, police chief 
Blair warned in a BBC interview against complacency, saying: 
"Another attack is likely. There's no doubt about that."
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two people were confirmed dead, and some 700 injured, from 
the bombs that went off at the peak of morning rush hour Thursday on 
three London subway trains and a double-decker bus.
</P>
<P>
The death toll was certain to rise, with police liaison officers 
assisting a total of 74 families.
</P>
<P>
Police released the names of two more of the victims, taking the 
total of formal identifications so far to five.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the US embassy said that a ban since Friday on US air 
force personnel entering London in the wake of the bombings had been 
lifted following bitter criticism from police, politicians and 
tourism officials.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 US servicemen at two air bases in the east of 
England had been ordered to keep out of London, despite appeals for 
life in London to resume as quickly as possible to make clear that 
Britons will not be cowed by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Monday that no effort 
would be spared to find the bombers, whom he associated with 
Al-Qaeda network -- the group behind the September 11 attacks in the 
United States in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"We are united in our determination that our country will not be 
defeated by such terror," he told parliament.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people in London remain missing and feared dead, as 
the grim task of recovering human remains from the tangled wreckage 
of subway trains continued amidst hellish conditions deep under 
ground.
</P>
<P>
Police set up a vast temporary mortuary in a military barracks 
just east of the city centre where next of kin were being taken to 
identify victims.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports Tuesday, the bomb-gutted Number 30 
bus -- in which 13 were killed -- was proving the most productive 
hunting ground for detectives.
</P>
<P>
"There are two bodies which have to be examined in great detail 
because they appear to have been holding the bomb or sitting on top 
of it," a senior police source told The Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times newspaper said progress had been made toward 
naming the individual suspected of being responsible for the bus 
blast.

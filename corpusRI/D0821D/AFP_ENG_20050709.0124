Police working in a hot, dusty tunnel 
faced a "great challenge" recovering bodies from a bomb-hit train 
near central London's Russell Square subway station, police said 
Saturday.

"It is extremely hot and very dusty and it is a great challenge 
for them to continue their work to recover the remaining bodies from 
the train underground," British Transport Police Deputy Chief 
Constable Andy Trotter told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"This work will be slow, methodical and meticulous, and at the 
same time the forensic recovery teams are working alongside them in 
order to ensure that no clues are lost."

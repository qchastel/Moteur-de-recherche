LONDON, July 13
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are the last known movements of 
four men suspected of blowing themselves up on three London subway 
trains and a bus in Britain's worst terror attack that left at least 
52 people dead last week.
</P>
<P>
The police have yet to confirm officially the details of the 
bombings but the British press has drawn up a chilling account of 
Thursday's plot.
</P>
<P>
- Three of the suspects -- named by newspapers as Hasib Hussein, 
19, Shehzad Tanweer, 20 or 22, and Mohammed Sadique Khan, 30 -- 
drove from their homes in West Yorkshire, northern England, to 
Luton, northwest of London, where they met their fourth accomplice. 
All four were British of Pakistani origin.
</P>
<P>
- They left their rented car at a station carpark in Luton, each 
carrying a rucksack laden with explosives.
</P>
<P>
- At about 7:48 am (0648 GMT) the suspects caught a commuter 
train to King's Cross station in London, which was due to arrive at 
8:20 am.
</P>
<P>
- At about 8:30 am (0730 GMT) they were at King's Cross where 
they were captured on closed circuit television. They were 
reportedly chatting casually, carrying military-style heavy 
rucksacks. One of the alleged bombers, Hussein carried his in front 
of him and was wearing a distinctive jumper.
</P>
<P>
- Without elaborate farewells, the group split up.
</P>
<P>
- At around 8:50 am (0750 GMT), three bombs rip through London 
Underground subway trains near Aldgate station to the east, Edgware 
Road station to the west and King's Cross station in the north of 
the city centre. All the affected lines pass through King's Cross.
</P>
<P>
- Tanweer reportedly detonated the Edgware Road bomb, which left 
seven people dead. Khan is thought to be behind the Aldgate bomb, 
which left another seven dead and the unnamed bomber triggered the 
explosion near King's Cross, which killed at least 25.
</P>
<P>
- At 9:47 am (0847 GMT), a bomb explodes on the Number 30 
double-decker bus in Tavistock Square, central London. Hussein is 
believed to have caused the explosion, which killed 13 people.
</P>
<P>
- Shortly after 10:00 pm (2100 GMT), Hussein's mother, unable to 
reach her son on his mobile after the blasts, called a help line to 
report him missing. This call led the police to identify the 
suspects and triggered a series of raids on their homes in and 
around Leeds on Tuesday.

Terror-hardened London returns to normal after attacks

LONDON, July 12
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the terrorists' main aim in London 
last week was simply to kill people with bombs on public transport, 
their attacks were a grim success. If the plan was to sow fear and 
panic, they failed utterly.
</P>
<P>
Since Thursday's four bomb blasts on three subway trains and a 
bus, which killed at least 52 people in total, many have remarked 
about how quickly, and with how little fuss, people in the British 
capital resumed everyday life.
</P>
<P>
According to one claim of responsibility posted on the Internet, 
the attacks left "Britain burning in fear, terror, and fright".
</P>
<P>
This was far from the truth: though harrowing, the 
well-rehearsed plan to evacuate casualties from London Underground 
system and the wrecked bus worked quickly and without chaos.
</P>
<P>
For most of Thursday, central London had virtually no public 
transport, but workers accepted the inconvenience with a shrug, many 
making the long trek home on foot.
</P>
<P>
By Friday, much of the Underground system was operating again 
while bus routes were back to normal.
</P>
<P>
By the weekend, theatres had re-opened and on Sunday tens of 
thousands of people gathered without apparent fear outside 
Buckingham Palace to mark the 60th anniversary of World War II.
</P>
<P>
The swift return to normality was in contrast with the 
experiences of New York and Madrid after their own -- admittedly 
more devastating -- terror attacks on September 11, 2001 and March 
11 last year respectively.
</P>
<P>
Many commentators have pointed to the fact that London is no 
stranger to bombs, even terrorist ones.
</P>
<P>
From the 1970s onwards, the British capital was a regular target 
for the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the paramilitary group seeking 
an end to London's rule of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The attacks -- although nowhere near as deadly as that of last 
week -- continued until Northern Ireland's 1998 Good Friday peace 
deal.
</P>
<P>
London also prides itself on the so-called "Blitz spirit", an 
attitude of phlegmatic self-reliance formed in the dark days of 1940 
and 1941 when German bombers pounded the city night after night, 
killing many thousands.
</P>
<P>
"London is very used to terrorism. London had to deal with the 
IRA bombings for a number of years," said Stephen Clarke from the 
Institute of Psychiatry at King's College, part of London 
University.
</P>
<P>
"People are still very much hold onto the World War II spirit. 
People want to honour the memory of those who lived during the war, 
and the Blitz in particular.
</P>
<P>
"That's the British spirit: we will not be put down by anyone or 
anything. It's a very interesting psyche."
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Clarke added, Londoners had been "expecting a lot 
worse -- something like a dirty bomb, or bio-terrorism, or a bigger 
bomb, or more bombs."
</P>
<P>
Another key factor in shaping the city's response was that so 
much of the carnage was hidden from view in the subway system, added 
Professor Stephen Graham, an expert on urban living at the 
University of Durham.
</P>
<P>
"Even now, there very little to see. No images. The very fact 
that the attacks were underground means that they almost have to be 
imagined. In 9/11, the visual aspect was overpowering," he said.
</P>
<P>
But London also had its own defiant ethos, Graham added, shown 
in Londoners' business-as-usual reaction.
</P>
<P>
"It reflects a very strong determination not to have fear change 
the city," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to allow fear, which is the object of the 
attacks, to undermine what for many people is so special about 
London -- a global city where 200 languages are spoken."

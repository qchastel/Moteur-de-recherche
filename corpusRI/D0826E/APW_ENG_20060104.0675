<P>
President George W. Bush's re-election campaign is returning thousands of
dollars in campaign contributions connected to Jack Abramoff, the Republican
lobbyist who has admitted to bribing lawmakers in a case that is leading to a
widespread corruption probe involving top Washington officials.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Scott McClellan said Wednesday that Abramoff, his
wife and the Indian tribal associates that he worked for, donated thousands to
the Bush-Cheney 2004 campaign. The campaign will turn the donations over to the
American Heart Association, McClellan said, adding that has been the policy in
similar situations in the past.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff raised at least $100,000 (euro82,700) for Bush's re-election effort. It
was unclear how much exactly the campaign would be giving to charity since
McClellan referred questions about the matter to the Republican National
Committee, which did not immediately return phone calls about
it.
</P>
<P>
McClellan said Bush does not know Abramoff, although it's possible that the two
met at three holiday receptions Abramoff attended at the White House, McClellan
said.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff has agreed to tell prosecutors and the FBI about alleged bribes to
lawmakers and their aides on issues ranging from Internet gambling to wireless
phone service in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
He faces up to 11 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The full extent of the investigation is not yet known, but Justice Department
officials said Tuesday they intended to make use of the trove of e-mails and
other material in Abramoff's possession as part of a probe that is believed to
be focusing on as many as 20 members of Congress and aides.
</P>
<P>
"The corruption scheme with Mr. Abramoff is very extensive and we will continue
to follow it wherever it leads," said Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher,
head of the Justice Department's criminal division.
</P>
<P>
The political ramifications of the Abramoff probe were apparent, with minority
Democrats intending to make ethics a campaign issue in this election year. House
Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Abramoff's confession in court was "not a
surprise because this Republican Congress is the most corrupt in history and the
American people are paying the price."
</P>
<P>
Some political consultants and analysts are comparing potential damage from the
Abramoff investigation to the 1992 House of Representatives banking scandal that
led to the retirement or ouster of 77 lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Court papers in Abramoff's case refer to an aide to then-House Majority Leader
Tom DeLay who helped stop anti-gambling legislation regarding the Internet.
Abramoff, the papers state, paid the staffer's wife $50,000 (euro41,400) from
clients that benefited from the actions of the staffer, identified by a person
close to the investigation as Tony Rudy, DeLay's former deputy chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe is ongoing. Rudy
did not return a phone call Tuesday at his lobbying firm.
</P>
<P>
DeLay voted against his party on the Internet anti-gambling legislation which
was designed to make it easier for authorities to stop online gambling
sites.
</P>
<P>
DeLay attorney Richard Cullen said he believes that when the investigation is
completed and the truth is known that the Justice Department will conclude that
his client, who had risen to House majority leader before stepping down from the
post last year, did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy, mail fraud and tax evasion, with
his conduct outlined in court papers that refers to "a stream of things of value
to public officials in exchange for a series of official acts and
influence."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Abramoff was to plead guilty in Miami to criminal charges stemming
from Abramoff's 2000 purchase of SunCruz Casinos, a case that touches on Rep.
Bob Ney, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff's cooperation has made lawmakers nervous.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Dennis Hastert became the most recent addition to the roster of
politicians announcing plans to donate Abramoff's campaign contributions to
charity.
</P>
<P>
The court papers in the Washington case refer to Ney, saying that regarding
SunCruz, the congressman placed a statement drafted by Abramoff partner Michael
Scanlon in the Congressional Record. The statement, the court papers say, was
calculated to pressure the owner of SunCruz to sell on terms favorable to
Abramoff.
</P>
<P>
Ney denies wrongdoing, saying that "at the time I dealt with Jack Abramoff, I
obviously did not know, and had no way of knowing, the self-serving and
fraudulent nature of Abramoff's activities."
</P>
<P>
Abramoff and his former partner, Adam Kidan, are charged with concocting a false
$23 million (euro19 million) wire transfer making it appear they contributed a
sizable stake of their own cash into the $147.5 million (euro122.1 million)
purchase of cruise ships.

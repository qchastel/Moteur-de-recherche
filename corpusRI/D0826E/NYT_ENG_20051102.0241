LOUISIANA TRIBAL OFFICIALS TRYING TO PROTECT CASINO INTERESTS TESTIFY TO SENATE
COMMITTEE THAT ACCUSED FORMER LOBBYISTS BETRAYED THEM WASHINGTON -- Leaders
of the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana on Wednesday accused two
former lobbyists of scaring them into paying exorbitant fees by
suggesting that Texas would legalize gambling, hurting their casino's attraction
to patrons from the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
The tribal officials testified before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, which
is investigating the lobbying activities of Jack Abramoff and Michael
Scanlon, a former spokesman for Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas. The
two are accused of diverting millions of dollars from Indian
tribes for personal use.
</P>
<P>
The Coushattas, who paid Abramoff and Scanlon $36 million in fees
over three years, told the panel they feel betrayed by
the lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
"While Indian country has seen many con-men through history, few were
as skilled as Mr Abramoff and Mr. Scanlon at creating
and preying upon insecurities,"said Kevin Stickey, chairman of the Coushatta
tribe, which runs the casino resort near Kinder, La."They exaggerated
political threats, and they exaggerated economic threats."
</P>
<P>
Scanlon and Abramoff, who once boasted of a close working relationship
with DeLay, have denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Coushatta officials said that in 2001 they paid Scanlon's company, Capital
Campaign Strategies, $870,000 to set up a grass-roots political organization
in Texas to lobby against gambling.
</P>
<P>
They said Scanlon had written them that "with the Enron and
Continental Airlines debacles hitting the Houston area, they are desperate
for revenue. ... We have never before seen such a
pro-gaming atmosphere in Texas."
</P>
<P>
Enron filed for bankruptcy amid financial scandal and the airline was
hurt by a drop in travel after the Sept. 11,
2001, attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Texas Legislature was considering, but never approved, gambling. The Coushatta
paid the firm run by former Christian Coalition director Ralph
Reed to drum up opposition to gambling among ministers and
other social conservatives in Texas.
</P>
<P>
According to tribal officials, the Coushatta funneled $400,000 in funds through
third parties, who then paid Reed.
</P>
<P>
The lobbyists also worked against the tribe's interest, according to a
Senate investigation that uncovered an e-mail from Abramoff to an
associate in which he suggested trying to obtain the business
of the Alabama Coushatta, who wanted to open a rival
casino in Texas.
</P>
<P>
Scanlon charged the Coushatta of Louisiana $1.3 million to set up
a data base and then paid $104,000 to another firm
to construct the computer file.
</P>
<P>
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, said
Scanlon's accounting records showed that he also skimmed $115,000 from
the Indian fees to pay for his wedding, which ultimately
never took place. He diverted $1.4 million to pay for
work on his house and personal expenses, the committee found.
</P>
<P>
The committee heard conflicting testimony about whether Abramoff persuaded former Deputy
Secretary of the Interior, Steven Griles, to intervene on behalf
of the Coushattas to prevent the competing Jenna Choctaws tribe
from opening a casino in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
Griles told the committee he had not participated in the case.
But Michael Rosetti, former counsel to Interior Secretary Gale Norton,
told the senators he repeatedly had to rebuff Griles' efforts
to intervene. Griles acknowledged meeting with Abramoff several times.
</P>
<P>
McCain said he hoped to introduce legislation next week to address
some of the abuses.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff and Scanlon are also being investigated by the Justice Department.
And Abramoff has been indicted in Florida in a separate
case involving his ownership of a cruise ship company.

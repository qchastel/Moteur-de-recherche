LAWMAKER SHOULD STEP ASIDE IN DELAY INQUIRY, GROUPS SAY

<P>
Campaign watchdog groups said Friday that it would be
inappropriate for Rep. Melissa A. Hart to oversee any potential
inquiry of the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, because she
had received $15,000 from his political action committee and held
a fund-raiser at a restaurant owned by a Republican lobbyist
at the center of a growing corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
Hart, R-Pa., had been named by the House ethics committee chairman
to look into accusations about DeLay months ago, before the
ethics panel became deadlocked earlier this year. DeLay, of Texas,
is under scrutiny for overseas trips organized by Jack Abramoff,
the lobbyist, whose far-reaching political work is now the subject
of a federal grand jury investigation. Campaign records filed with
the Federal Election Commission show that Hart held a fund-raising
event at Abramoff's restaurant, Signatures, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Phone calls placed Friday night to Hart's Capitol Hill office and
a home listing in Pennsylvania were not returned.
</P>
<P>
After months of deadlock, Republicans and Democrats on the House Ethics
Committee reached agreement this week on rules that are likely
to lead to an investigation of DeLay, who was admonished
three times by the committee last year. Rep. Doc Hastings,
R-Wash., who is the panel's chairman, had said earlier this
month that he intended to appoint Hart to oversee any
review of the charges against the House leader. Since Republicans
agreed earlier this week to rescind rules that had made
it more difficult to open an ethics investigation, Hastings has
not said whether Hart would still direct any review.
</P>
<P>
"Her conclusions are automatically suspect because she has her own potential
ethics issues come into play," said Melanie Sloan, executive director
of the Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, which
alerted news organizations to campaign records showing that Hart had
spent $1,587 on a fund-raiser at Abramoff's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
The campaign records showed the event at Abramoff's restaurant was held
on Sept. 24, 2003, and that the payments went toward
"catering costs." Numerous other House Republicans have held events at
the same restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Other previously disclosed campaign records show that between 1999 and 2001,
Hart, from the 4th District of Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh, received
$15,000 from the political committee run by DeLay, the Americans
for a Republican Majority.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, an editorial in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette praised Hart for
"her willingness to take on party leaders in her earlier
service in the state Legislature."
</P>
<P>
"But her dogged party loyalty could cloud the independence she needs
to follow the facts" in the investigation of DeLay, the
editorial said. "She also needs to overcome the reality that
she accepted $15,000 from one of Mr. DeLay's political action
committees."

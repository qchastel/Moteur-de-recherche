LOBBYIST'S DOWNFALL LEADS TO CHARITIES' WINDFALL

The White Buffalo Woman Calf Society, a center for
battered women in tiny Mission, S.D., is far removed from
the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal that rocked Washington this week.
But the society, along with many other charities large and
small, is about to become a beneficiary of Abramoff's legendary
largess.
</P>
<P>
As panicked lawmakers rush to distance themselves from Abramoff after his
guilty pleas in federal and state courts, tens of thousands
of dollars in political donations from the disgraced Republican lobbyist
and his Indian tribe clients are being returned or redirected
to charities in a vast Robin Hood-like reordering of campaign
funds.
</P>
<P>
Many of these charitable groups -- including the White Buffalo Woman
Calf Society, which will receive $2,000 from Sen. John Thune,
R-S.D. -- have American Indian ties, creating a certain symmetry,
albeit an imperfect one, given that Abramoff has pleaded guilty
to bilking the tribes of millions.
</P>
<P>
Some tribes like the Saginaw Chippewa and the Mississippi band of
Choctaw Indians are getting campaign contributions back. But the refunds
are not entirely welcome; tribal officials complain of being branded
as pariahs and worry that their clout in Washington will
be diminished if lawmakers refuse to accept their money.
</P>
<P>
Yet the Abramoff plea bargain has been a boon to organizations
as varied as the Boy Scouts and the Mississippi Hurricane
Recovery Fund. President Bush is giving $6,000 to the American
Heart Association. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is giving $18,500 to
a Christian mission in his home state. Sen. Hillary Rodham
Clinton, D-N.Y., is giving $2,000 to New York charities that
have not been publicly identified.
</P>
<P>
Campaign finance experts say the donations are perfectly legal, so long
as the original contribution did not violate the law. As
for the charities, they are happy to get the Abramoff
money, if a teensy bit uncomfortable with the attendant publicity.
</P>
<P>
"If we go down the road of assessing what's in the
mind and hearts of every donor, we might find ourselves
in tricky waters," said Diana Aviv, president and chief executive
of Independent Sector, a nonprofit group that represents more than
600 American charities. "Part of it is to get rid
of money that for them is hot. So what are
their options? Give it back to Jack Abramoff? I don't
think so."

SENATOR COMING UNDER INCREASING SCRUTINY FOR ROLE IN CASINO CLOSURE

<P>
The closing of the Speaking Rock Casino near El
Paso in February 2002 was one of John Cornyn's proudest
moments as Texas attorney general.
</P>
<P>
His determination to shut down the Tigua Indian tribe's casino because
it was opened in violation of state law earned the
Texas Republican kudos and pledges of support from Christian political
organizers -- backing that proved helpful as Cornyn made his
successful run for the U.S. Senate that year.
</P>
<P>
House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, for weeks has been
in an all-out political war, defending himself from allegations of
ethical lapses, many of them connected directly or indirectly to
the battle over tribal casinos.
</P>
<P>
But Cornyn's role in the casino controversy is only beginning to
draw attention.
</P>
<P>
The shuttering of the Speaking Rock Casino is being explored by
investigators for the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, as well as
a federal multi-agency task force and grand jury that are
examining the actions of Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff and public
relations associate Mike Scanlon.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff and Scanlon had many Indian gaming clients, including the Tigua
Ysleta de Sur Pueblo, as the Tigua are known. The
lobbyists are at the center of a fraud and fund-raising
scandal that has embroiled DeLay.
</P>
<P>
Cornyn, elected senator in 2002, was supported in his anti-Speaking Rock
effort by a grassroots campaign led by conservative Christian lobbyist
Ralph Reed, who organized pastors around the state to oppose
gaming and back the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
Senate investigators discovered that Abramoff hired Reed to block gaming expansion
in Texas and Louisiana -- and that the $4 million
that Reed was paid actually came from Abramoff's Indian gaming
clients.
</P>
<P>
Then, Abramoff and Scanlon secured the Tigua as a client on
the day the casino was closed and charged them $4.2
million for a campaign to reopen it through federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Cornyn said he was "unaware" of Reed's role
in Texas although he knew Reed from GOP political circles.
</P>
<P>
"I, of course, had filed the lawsuit earlier on. That was
already a done deal," Cornyn said. "It was nice to
receive that support, but it didn't have much to do
with what we were already doing."
</P>
<P>
Cornyn's office filed the lawsuit, charging the tribe with violating the
anti-gambling terms of a law giving them federal recognition, in
September 1999.
</P>
<P>
"I never met with him," Cornyn said of Reed, dismissing e-mail
traffic in 2001 and 2002 between Reed and Abramoff that
suggests a close alliance with the Texas attorney general during
the lengthy court decisions and appeals.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure my name has been taken in vain before, so
I'm not surprised," said the Texas senator. "Maybe lobbyists were
engaged in self-promotion. I was doing my duty to enforce
the law."
</P>
<P>
Cornyn said that he does not recall any contact with Abramoff
and did not know that the lobbyist contributed $1,000 to
his 2002 campaign.
</P>
<P>
Despite Cornyn's image as a gaming foe, he received $6,250 in
contributions for his 2002 race from Las Vegas casino interests,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which compiled data
from the Federal Election Commission. Some of the contributions were
made at the same time Cornyn was pushing to close
the Tigua casino.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he opposes gambling, Cornyn replied: "No, not if it's
in compliance with the law. It's legal to gamble in
Nevada, and it's not legal to gamble in Texas."
</P>
<P>
During the 2002 campaign, Cornyn attended a fund-raiser at the home
of Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton in an event organized
by Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev. The contributions at the May
29 event are a small part of the $9.8 million
that Cornyn received in the 2002 race.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Abramoff's alleged double-dealings with the Tigua, Cornyn said, "Without
prejudging, I find it somewhat disturbing."
</P>
<P>
In a series of e-mails released by the Senate Indian Affairs
Committee, Cornyn's name appears numerous times in communications among Reed,
Abramoff and Scanlon. As a result, he has drawn some
criticism.
</P>
<P>
"Cornyn is getting a pass that he doesn't deserve," said Melanie
Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in
Washington, referring to the lack of attention to the senator's
involvement.
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that he's working with Ralph Reed, who's being
paid by Indian gaming interests," Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 12, 2001, Abramoff and Reed discussed strategy for supporting
Cornyn. Reed writes Abramoff: "Great work. Get me details so
I can alert Cornyn and let him know what we
are doing to help him."
</P>
<P>
Cornyn said he had no contact with Reed.
</P>
<P>
Reed, former executive director of the Christian Coalition, was hired by
Abramoff, an old friend, who was working at the Greenberg
Traurig law firm. The firm forced him out a year
ago when it discovered Abramoff had hidden at least $10
million from Indian clients. Reed's company, Century Strategies, was paid
by Scanlon's companies.
</P>
<P>
Reed denies knowing that he was being paid by Indian tribes.
"Jack hired Ralph to organize a grassroots coalition to close
one casino and prevent another casino from opening," said Lisa
Baron, Reed's spokeswoman, "which was in line with Ralph's philosophical
views and grassroots business."
</P>
<P>
However, in an e-mail sent Jan. 7, 2002, there is the
suggestion that Reed knew who he was working for. Reed
wrote Abramoff: "Hope these developments help with client."
</P>
<P>
"We are proud of the work we did in closing the
casino," Baron said. "We did not know of any specific
clients or any specific interests involved. We are in the
business of closing casinos.
</P>
<P>
"How would we know where the money was coming from?"
</P>
<P>
Reed is well-connected politically. A former Georgia GOP chairman, he was
the Southeast regional campaign chairman for the Bush-Cheney 2004 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Louisiana Coushattas paid Reed $3 million, fearing casino competition from
another tribe in Louisiana and the expansion of gaming in
Texas, which would probably draw gamblers away.
</P>
<P>
The Louisiana Coushattas, who paid Abramoff and Scanlon more than $30
million, have sued Abramoff, Scanlon, and Greenberg Traurig, accusing them
of a variety of abuses, including fraud, overbilling and negligence.

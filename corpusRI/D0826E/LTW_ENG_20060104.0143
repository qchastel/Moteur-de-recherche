In Florida, Abramoff Pleads Guilty Again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former lobbyist Jack Abramoff's second guilty plea in
two days sealed his role as a star witness in the federal government's
largest congressional corruption investigation in decades.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff Wednesday admitted in U.S. District Court in Miami that he
engaged in fraud and conspiracy in his purchase of a fleet of casino
boats in 2000, when he presented lenders with a counterfeit document
showing that he and a partner had put $23 million into the deal. In
fact, Abramoff and partner Adam Kidan put virtually no money into the
purchase, and the cruise line went bankrupt the following year.
</P>
<P>
The appearance was made a day after Abramoff pleaded guilty in
Washington to defrauding Indian tribal clients, conspiring to bribe
members of Congress and evading taxes. The Florida and Washington
cases were resolved together in an agreement that requires the
ex-lobbyist to provide evidence and testimony in the Justice
Department's probe of corruption in Congress and executive branch
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Kidan and another Abramoff partner, Michael Scanlon, already have
pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
Prosecutors are now expected to turn their attention to congressional
aides and former Capitol Hill staffers who went to work for Abramoff
in order to learn more about the actions of members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
While Abramoff's cooperation is a major boon to prosecutors, his
admissions of fraud this week also could provide ammunition against
him if he testifies against lawmakers, some ethics lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
``He defrauded the tribes, he defrauded his law firms, so why isn't
it that he defrauded public officials as well?'' said Jan W. Baran, an
attorney at Wiley Rein &amp; Fielding. ``Proving somebody accepted
campaign contributions and expense-paid trips and then did something
of benefit for Abramoff is not in and of itself proving bribery.''
</P>
<P>
To make a bribery case against a legislator, prosecutors would need
to prove that lawmakers knew Abramoff's gifts were in exchange for
specific actions. Many legislators under investigation, such as Rep.
Robert W. Ney, R-Ohio, have denied any wrongdoing and have said that,
like the tribes, they were defrauded by Abramoff.
</P>
<P>
``I think it is bigger than any congressional scandal I can
remember and certainly politically it touches hundreds of members,''
said Kenneth Gross, a former Federal Election Commission attorney.
``Still, I think it is a tough case. This is by no means a slam dunk
for the government, even with Abramoff part of the prosecution team
now.''
</P>
<P>
The legal standard for proving bribery is high because of a
unanimous Supreme Court ruling in 1999 requiring prosecutors to show
that gifts were given for specific government action. In the case, the
court threw out the conviction of Sun-Diamond, a California
cooperative accused of illegally showering Agriculture Secretary Mike
Espy with sports tickets, meals and other gifts. The court said it was
not enough that the cooperative had two regulatory issues before the
department.
</P>
<P>
``The standard that was set forth in the Espy case set a very high
bar for quid pro quo and corrupt intent,'' Gross said.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys, however, noted that there are key differences in the
Abramoff case. ``In Espy, they didn't have the equivalent of an
Abramoff or Scanlon connecting the dots,'' Gross said. ``Here they are
armed with that additional arsenal in that case.''
</P>
<P>
Stanley M. Brand, a former House counsel who was involved in the
Sun-Diamond case, said that the Abramoff investigation appears to
exceed the standard set by the Supreme Court. ``In a case of nuance,
when you don't have eyewitnesses who are participants in a
transaction, you have a problem,'' Brand said. ``In this case, you do.
The jury will have no problem convicting if they have three
eyewitnesses.''
</P>
<P>
Abramoff's sentence in the Florida case is to be served
concurrently with the penalty in the Washington case. If he lives up
to the terms of his plea agreement, he is expected to face about 10
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
R. Alexander Acosta, the acting U.S. attorney in Miami, said the
Florida investigation is continuing, led by Assistant U.S. Attorney
Lawrence LaVecchio. Florida prosecutors are working closely with
attorneys from the Department of Justice's fraud and public integrity
sections, who are overseeing a multiagency task force of 35 to 40
lawyers and investigators.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the case is being run by Noel Hillman and Mary K.
Butler of the public integrity section, and acting fraud section chief
Paul E. Pelletier, along with prosecuting attorney Guy D. Singer.
</P>
<P>
One of the key investigative strands that involves authorities in
Florida and Washington is the investigation of Ney, chairman of the
House Administration Committee. Ney, who received favors and
contributions from Abramoff, placed comments in the Congressional
Record that pressured SunCruz's owner, Konstantinos ``Gus'' Boulis, to
sell his fleet to Abramoff and Kidan.
</P>
<P>
Boulis died in a gangland-style hit a few months later. Three men,
including two associates of Kidan, have been charged in the killing.

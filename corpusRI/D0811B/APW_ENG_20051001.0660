Scientists discover moon orbiting so-called 10th planet

The astronomers who claim to have discovered the 10th planet in the solar system
have made another intriguing announcement: it has a moon.
</P>
<P>
While observing the new, so-called planet from Hawaii last month, a team of
astronomers led by Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology
spotted a faint object trailing next to it. Because it was moving, astronomers
ruled it was a moon and not a background star, which is stationary.
</P>
<P>
The moon discovery is important because it can help scientists determine the new
planet's mass. In July, Brown announced the discovery of an icy, rocky object
larger than Pluto in the Kuiper Belt, a disc of icy bodies beyond Neptune. Brown
labeled the object a planet and nicknamed it Xena after the lead character in
the former TV series "Xena: Warrior Princess."
</P>
<P>
By determining the moon's distance and orbit around Xena, scientists can
calculate how heavy Xena is. For example, the faster a moon goes around a
planet, the more massive a planet is.
</P>
<P>
But the newly discovered moon, nicknamed Gabrielle after Xena's faithful
traveling sidekick in the TV series, likely will not quell the debate over what
exactly is a planet and whether Pluto should keep its status. The problem is
there is no official definition for a planet and setting standards like size
limits potentially invites other objects to take the "planet"
label.
</P>
<P>
Possessing a moon is not a criteria of planethood since Mercury and Venus are
moonless planets. Brown said he expected to find a moon orbiting Xena because
many Kuiper Belt objects are paired with moons.
</P>
<P>
The moon is about 155 miles wide and 60 times fainter than Xena, the
farthest-known object in the solar system. It is currently 9 billion miles away
from the sun, or about three times Pluto's current distance from the
sun.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe Xena's moon was formed when Kuiper Belt objects collided with
one another. The Earth's moon formed in a similar way when Earth crashed into an
object the size of Mars.
</P>
<P>
The moon was first spotted by a 10-meter telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory
in Hawaii on Sept. 10. Scientists expect to learn more about the moon's
composition during further observations with the Hubble Space Telescope in
November.
</P>
<P>
Brown planned to submit a paper describing the moon discovery to the
Astrophysical Journal next week.
</P>
<P>
The International Astronomical Union, a group of scientists responsible for
naming planets, is deciding on formal names for Xena and Gabrielle.

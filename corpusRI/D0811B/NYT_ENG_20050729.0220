10TH PLANET FOUND IN SKEWED ORBIT BEYOND PLUTO
</HEADLINE>

Add a tenth planet to the solar system -- or possibly
subtract one.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers announced Friday that they have found a lump of rock
and ice that is larger than Pluto and the farthest
known object in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
The discovery will likely rekindle debate over the definition of "planet"
and whether Pluto still merits the designation. The new object
-- as yet unnamed, but temporarily known as 2003 UB313
-- is now 9 billion miles away from the sun,
or 97 times as far away as the Earth and
about three times Pluto's current distance from the sun. Its
560-year elliptical orbit brings it as close as 3.3 billion
miles. Pluto's orbit ranges between 2.7 billion and 4.6 billion
miles.
</P>
<P>
The astronomers do not have an exact size for the new
planet, but its brightness and distance tell them that it
is larger than Pluto, the smallest of the nine known
planets.
</P>
<P>
"It is guaranteed bigger than Pluto," said Michael E. Brown, a
professor of planetary astronomy at Caltech and a member of
the team that made the discovery.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made Jan. 8 at Palomar Observatory in California.
Brown and the other members of the team -- Chadwick
A. Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii and David
L. Rabinowitz of Yale -- then found that they had,
unknowingly, taken images of the planet, using the observatory's 48-inch
telescope, as far back as 2003.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the same team announced the discovery of a distant
body they named Sedna, which, until the latest discovery, had
held the title of farthest known object in the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
What is most surprising is that the orbit of the planet
is sharply skewed to most of the rest of the
solar system. The orbits of the most of the planets
lie close to the same plane as Earth's, known as
the ecliptic plane. The orbit of 2003 UB313 is tilted
by 44 degrees.
</P>
<P>
"That blows my mind," said Harold Levison of the Southwest Research
Institute in Boulder, Colo., who was not involved in the
discovery. "Getting something up that high is very hard."
</P>
<P>
The new planet could have been easily discovered much sooner if
anyone had looked at that part of the sky.
</P>
<P>
"It's because no one looks that far off the ecliptic," Brown
said. "No one expects to have an inclination that high."

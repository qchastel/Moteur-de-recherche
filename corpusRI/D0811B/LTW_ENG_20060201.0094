What is a Planet? Answer Will Redefine Solar System

<P>
So what, exactly, is a planet? Astronomers have been
deadlocked over this for years, but a decision may finally be
forthcoming, because a thing they discovered last year in the solar
system's outer reaches has turned out to be bigger than Pluto.
</P>
<P>
So if Pluto hangs on to its status -- by no means a slam-dunk -- then
the fetchingly named 2003 UB313, which is about 30 percent fatter,
probably would have to be a planet, too. The 10th.
</P>
<P>
But if Pluto gets demoted, the solar system will have just eight.
Either way, textbooks that refer to nine planets are doomed to
obsolescence.
</P>
<P>
``It's only fair,'' said astronomer Frank Bertoldi of Germany's
University of Bonn. ``It's my view that Pluto for historical reasons
should remain a planet -- otherwise school kids will be confused. Any
object that's bigger than Pluto should also be a planet.''
</P>
<P>
Bertoldi, reporting Thursday in the journal Nature, led a research
team that measured surface temperatures of 2003 UB313 to confirm that
this ``ice dwarf,'' more than 9 billion miles from the sun at its
farthest point, is about 1,800 miles in diameter, whereas Pluto's
diameter is about 1,380 miles.
</P>
<P>
Neither one is ``big.'' Earth's moon is 2,160 miles across.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers had suspected that 2003 UB313 was at least as big as
Pluto and probably bigger when its discoverers measured its brightness
last summer. Any object that far away could not be as bright as it was
and still be smaller than Pluto.
</P>
<P>
``But they didn't know how big it was, or whether it could have
been as big as Mercury,'' said Carnegie Institute of Washington
astronomer Scott Sheppard, author of an article accompanying the
Nature paper.
</P>
<P>
To pin down 2003 UB313's size, astronomers needed to know not only
its brightness but also its ``reflectivity'' -- how much of the
sunlight illuminating the distant body was bouncing off its surface.
</P>
<P>
``A small body with high reflectivity can be as bright as a large
body with low reflectivity,'' Sheppard said. Brightness in the visible
spectrum is a function of both the reflectivity of the body and its
``size'' -- expressed as the area illuminated by the sun.
</P>
<P>
To determine reflectivity, Bertoldi's team used a radio telescope
in the mountains of southern Spain to examine 2003 UB313 in thermal
wavelengths close to infrared and not visible to the naked eye. There
its ``heat signature'' could be measured and subtracted from the total
sunlight that reached it. The difference was the reflectivity.
</P>
<P>
``We took two measurements and got a consistent solution,''
Bertoldi said in a telephone interview. ``We've done this many times
over the years, and it's a very secure way of measuring the size of an
object'' when the object is either too small or too far away to be
analyzed easily by a traditional optical telescope.
</P>
<P>
A team of researchers led by the California Institute of
Technology's Michael Brown reported the discovery of 2003 UB313 last
summer. It was the most distant object ever seen in the solar system,
a chill sphere cloaked in water and methane ice, and circling the sun
in a highly eccentric orbit 44 degrees off the plane where most of the
planets dwell.
</P>
<P>
Brown nicknamed the new discovery ``Lila,'' after his baby
daughter, but permanent naming awaits a decision by the International
Astronomical Union, which is also trying to decide how to define a
planet.
</P>
<P>
This, it appears, is heavy going. One school agrees with Bertoldi
that the Pluto tradition should be upheld, but another suggests that
Pluto, 2003 UB313 and other icy denizens of the Kuiper Belt beyond
Neptune are not planets but ``objects.'' There is no clear leader in
the debate.
</P>
<P>
``Until they decide whether it's a planet or not, we don't know how
to name it,'' Brown said in a telephone interview. ``This could go on
for years.''

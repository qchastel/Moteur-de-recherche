PLUTO, THE POSSIBLE PLANET, GETS ANOTHER LOOK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So maybe Pluto is a planet after all.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers in recent years were having doubts. Perhaps Pluto, small,
distant and poorly observed, should be downgraded from true planet to
a mere Kuiper Belt Object, or KBO, one of the thousands of icy bodies
orbiting beyond Neptune that probably are leftovers from the creation
of the outer solar system.
</P>
<P>
"People were finding all these KBOs that were huge, literally half
the size of Pluto or larger," said John Stansberry, an astronomer at
the University of Arizona. "But those supposed sizes were based on
assumptions that KBOs have low albedos, similar to comets."
</P>
<P>
Albedo is a measure of how much light an object reflects. The more
light it reflects, the higher its albedo and the smaller its size
needs to be.
</P>
<P>
In a report last week at a meeting of planetary scientists in
Louisville, Ky., Stansberry said a recently discovered KBO, first
estimated to be 932 miles in diameter, appeared in new observations
to be no more than 435 miles wide. It was a matter of the albedo --
18 percent, instead of the assumed 4 percent for previous
calculations.
</P>
<P>
The measured object, designated 2002 AW197, is one of the largest
nonplanet bodies in the solar system, and yet is only about 30
percent as large as the 1,400-mile-wide Pluto. The revised estimate
is based on the first results from a survey of large Kuiper Belt
Objects by the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared observatory in
Earth orbit.
</P>
<P>
As more KBO albedos are studied, astronomers should find out if the
first object is typical, or an oddball, and if Pluto appears to be
significantly different from these smaller objects.
</P>
<P>
A planned survey of 30 such objects, Stansberry said, "will help us
determine what their compositions are, how they evolve, how massive
they are, what their real size distributions and dynamics are -- and
how Pluto fits into the whole picture."
</P>
<P>
Michael Shara, chairman of the astrophysics department at the Hayden
Planetarium in New York, said the Spitzer telescope's infrared
observations "appear rock-solid and a terrific piece of work."
</P>
<P>
The planetarium, at the American Museum of Natural History, has had a
leading role in reclassifying Pluto. In its exhibition hall, eight
planets are prominently displayed, and the supposed ninth, Pluto,
rates only a plaque, casting doubt on its status as a planet.
</P>
<P>
"We remain convinced that Pluto is not a planet, but one of the
Kuiper Belt Objects," Shara said. But, he allowed, the new
observations could eventually restore Pluto's planetary status.

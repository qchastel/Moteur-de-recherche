PLUTO: A FEW DAYS' DELAY COULD ADD YEARS TO TRIP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cox News Service ATLANTA -- NASA is poised to begin its
first mission to the last planet, a 4 billion mile,
9-year journey to the icy outback of the solar system.
The destination is Pluto, its moon Charon -- and then
beyond, into vast unexplored region of the solar system known
as the Kuiper Belt.
</P>
<P>
over the plutonium power source the spacecraft carries -- the New
Horizons Pluto probe could be launched as early as 1:24
p.m. Tuesday. The launch window of about two hours a
day extends through mid-February.
</P>
<P>
The $700 million mission is the capstone to NASA's exploration of
the planets than began with the Mariner 2 flyby of
Venus in 1962. As a sign of how times change,
by the time the latest probe reaches its destination in
2015, Pluto may no longer be considered a planet. Or
if it is, it probably won't be the outermost.
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty is a tribute to how much more than four
decades of planetary exploration has revealed about our solar system
-- and how much remains to be discovered, especially out
where no spacecraft has ventured before.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, everyone knew how many planets there were. There
were, with the discovery of Pluto in 1930, exactly nine.
Generations of high school students earned their A's in science
class with papier-m?ch? models of the solar system that included
nine -- count 'em nine -- planets.
</P>
<P>
Lately, however, the situation has grown more complex. To some, Pluto
and Charon, discovered in 1978, are no longer planet and
moon, but -- because they are so close to each
other, so similar in size and both actually orbit a
center of mass between them -- a binary planet system.
</P>
<P>
To make the once rigid order of the solar system even
messier, astronomers have found more than 80 other bodies --
variously known as minor planets, planetoids, trans-Neptunian objects or Kuiper
Belt objects -- that lie near or beyond the ninth
rock from the sun.
</P>
<P>
Pluto, in fact, because its erratic orbit sometimes take it inside
the orbit of Neptune, is sometimes actually the eighth rock
from the sun.
</P>
<P>
Scientists estimate that the Kuiper Belt, which stretches for more than
a billion miles beyond Pluto, may hold thousands of such
objects. At least four of those already identified have their
own moons. And some may, like Pluto and Charon, be
binary "planet" systems themselves.
</P>
<P>
As the census of the outer solar system has grown to
include the likes of Orcus, Ixion, Quaoar and Buffy, some
astronomers have suggested that Pluto, which is smaller than Earth's
moon, is more like other Kuiper Belt objects than it
is like other planets.
</P>
<P>
The picture got even more confusing last year with the reported
discovery of 2003 UB313, an object some scientists are hailing
as "the tenth planet," -- an object code-named Xena. It
is larger than Pluto and more than three times farther
from the sun. And it too has its own moon.
</P>
<P>
So far, the International Astronomical Union, which has the say in
such matters, hasn't revoked Pluto's planethood -- or conferred planet
status on UB313.
</P>
<P>
By whatever name they are finally called, however, these outliers of
the solar system are objects of intense scientific curiosity. Pluto
and the other icy bodies that swarm the Kuiper Belt
are thought to be the leftovers from the birth of
the solar system -- preserved in a cosmic deep freeze
since Earth and the other planets coalesced 4.5 billion years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"Exploring Pluto and Charon what lies beyond, is going to be
like conducting an archaeological dig into the history of the
outer solar system," says the mission's chief scientist, Alan Stern,
of the Southwest Research Institute's Department of Space Studies. "And
when this spacecraft gets there, we are going to be
like kids in a candy shop."
</P>
<P>
These kids, however, are going to have to be patient. Boosted
into space by a powerful three-stage rocket, the New Horizons
spacecraft will be hurled into space faster than any man-made
object in history. It will need all the speed it
can muster.
</P>
<P>
If the spacecraft is launched Tuesday, it won't reach Pluto until
July 2015. Because of the changing position of the planets,
a delay of even a few weeks could add years
to the flight time.
</P>
<P>
Outbound at 36,000 miles an hour, the spacecraft it will cover
the distance to the moon in just nine hours --
a trip that took the Apollo astronauts three days. By
early 2007, it will be hurtling past Jupiter, using the
giant planet's gravity to sling it even faster toward the
outer solar system.
</P>
<P>
Like NASA's other deep space probes, the Pluto-bound spacecraft gets its
electrical power from a compact radioisotope thermoelectric generator, powered by
the radioactive decay of plutonium.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Gagnon, of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power
contends that a launch accident would scatter plutonium over a
large area of central Florida. He discounts the space agency's
record of 24 successful launches with similar plutonium generators.
</P>
<P>
"One thing we have learned is that sooner or later, space
technology can fail," he says.
</P>
<P>
The plutonium power source will provide 200 watts of power for
the spacecraft -- about what it takes to light two
standard light bulbs -- but that will be enough to
operate all seven of its scientific instruments during the encounter
with Pluto as well as to transmit pictures and data
to Earth.
</P>
<P>
"Pluto is a treasure trove of scientific information just waiting to
be discovered," says Andy Danzler, the director of NASA's Solar
System Exploration Division.
</P>
<P>
The probe, which will come within 6,000 miles of Pluto's icy
surface will give scientists their best view ever of a
body that until recently has never been more than a
fuzzy blob of light.
</P>
<P>
From Earth, Pluto is 50,000 times fainter than Mars. Its atmosphere
of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide is thousands of times
less dense than Earth's. And the temperature at the surface
is a frigid 382 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
"Out Earth-based observations are still too crude to tell us much
about what we'll see when we finally get there," says
Stern. "We still don't know what we don't know about
Pluto."
</P>
<P>
Discoveries about Pluto and its neighbors are likely to roll in
during the ten years NASA's probe is en route.
</P>
<P>
Only last year, for instance, a survey using the Hubble Space
Telescope found that Pluto and Charon have two other, smaller
moons, currently named P1 and P2, making the system the
New Horizons spacecraft is bound for even more complex that
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
"Pluto has been a harbinger of the mysteries that await on
the planetary frontier," says Danzler. "In 1930, it offered a
preview of the icy, rocky objects in what would become
known as the Kuiper Belt. "Pluto's new moons are just
the latest in a spectacular series of discoveries made from
and above the Earth."
</P>
<P>
And once Pluto is in the rearview mirror a decade from
now, scientists hope to send the spacecraft on to visit
at least two Kuiper Belt objects. Although the craft's power
diminishes with time, the generator could support a decade or
more of exploration beyond Pluto.

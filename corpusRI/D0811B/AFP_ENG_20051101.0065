NASA says Pluto may have three moons instead of one

<P>
Pluto, the smallest and most distant 
planet of the solar system, may have three moons instead of just 
one, according to images NASA said were taken by the orbiting Hubble 
Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers from the Southwest Research Institute reported 
observing the moons in May as they described near circular orbits 
around the icy planet in three days, the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration said.
</P>
<P>
If the discovery is confirmed by the International Astronomical 
Union, the two new moons will be named after characters in Greek and 
Roman mythology and take their side along Charon, Pluto's moon 
discovered in 1978.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the two tiny satellites have been named 
S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2. They have eluded detection so long because 
they are 5,000 times dimmer than Pluto.
</P>
<P>
The two moons-in-waiting were observed to be approximately 
44,000 kilometers (27,000 miles) and 53,000 kilometers (44,000 
miles) away from Pluto -- two or three times as far from the planet 
as Charon.
</P>
<P>
Compared to Charon's 1,200 kilometer (745 mile) diameter, the 
two new moons are pint-sized: just 32 kilometers (20 miles) and 70 
kilometers (43 miles) across, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Pluto was discovered in 1930 at a distance of some 6.4 billion 
kilometers (three billion miles) from the sun in the heart of the 
Kuiper Belt -- a zone beyond Neptune 4.5-7.5 billion kilometers 
(2.8-4.6 billion miles) from the sun.
</P>
<P>
The Kuiper Belt is estimated to include more than 35,000 objects 
of more than 100 kilomters (65 miles) in diameter: the remnants of 
the sun's accretion ring of matter from which all the planets were 
formed.
</P>
<P>
"If, as our new Hubble images indicate, Pluto has not one, but 
two or three moons, it will become the first body in the Kuiper Belt 
known to have more than one satellite," said astrophysicist Hal 
Weaver, of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, in Laurel, 
Maryland, and a co-leader of the team that made the discovery.
</P>
<P>
The discoveries were made as the team prepared a NASA robotic 
mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt to be launched early next 
year.
</P>
<P>
Pluto, with its relatively small diameter of 2,252 kilometers 
(1,400 miles)  is not considered a real planet by many astronomers.

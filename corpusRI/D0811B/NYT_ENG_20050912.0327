ONE FIND, TWO ASTRONOMERS: AN ETHICAL BRAWL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a group of Spanish astronomers reported in July that they
had discovered a spectacular addition to the solar system, a
bright ball of ice almost as big as Pluto sailing
the depths of space out beyond Neptune, Dr. Michael Brown
of Caltech chalked it up to coincidence and bad luck.
His own group had been tracking the object, now known
as 2003 EL61, for months but had told no one.
</P>
<P>
He sent the leader of the group, Dr. Jose-Luis Ortiz, of
the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia, in Granada, a congratulatory
e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
Now Brown has asked for an investigation of Ortiz's discovery, alleging
a serious breach of scientific ethics. Archival records, he said,
show that only a day before the discovery was reported,
computers traced to Ortiz and his student Pablo Santos-Sanz visited
a Web site containing data on where and when the
Caltech group's telescope was pointed.
</P>
<P>
The information in these observing logs could have been used to
help find the object on the Spanish images, taken more
than two years ago, or simply to confirm that both
groups discovered the same object. Depending on what the Spanish
astronomers did, their failure to mention the Caltech observations could
be considered scientific dishonesty or even fraud, Brown suggests.
</P>
<P>
In comments for his Web site (www.gps.caltech.edu/(TILDE)mbrown/planetlila), which includes a detailed
timeline of the events surrounding the July announcement, he writes:
"It is not clear from the timeline precisely what Ortiz
and Santos-Sanz knew and how they used the records that
they accessed. They were required by the standards of science,
however, to acknowledge their use of our Web-based records."
</P>
<P>
In an e-mail message to Dr. Brian Marsden of the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics, who is director of International Astronomical Union's
Minor Planet Center, the clearinghouse for such discoveries, Brown wrote
on Aug. 15, "I request that Ortiz et al. be
stripped of official discovery status and that the IAU issue
a statement condemning their actions."
</P>
<P>
Ortiz did not respond to numerous e-mail messages and telephone calls.
Last week in an e-mail message to Brown, Ortiz neither
admitted nor denied looking at the observing logs. Instead he
criticized Brown's failure to report discoveries promptly to the Minor
Planet Center, saying that his penchant for "hiding objects" had
alienated other astronomers and harmed science.
</P>
<P>
"And remember," he said in the message, which Brown provided to
The New York Times, "the only reason why we are
now exchanging e-mail is because you did not report your
object."
</P>
<P>
But Jose Carlos del Toro Iniesta, director of the Andalusian institute,
said in an e-mail message that he intended to investigate
Brown's allegations, adding, "I beg your understanding in separating clearly
the institute as a whole from its individual members: the
researchers' actions are their sole responsibility."
</P>
<P>
The spectacular allegation has flummoxed the International Astronomical Union. Saying that
he and his colleagues had never been fooled before, Marsden
admitted that the IAU had no protocol for adjudicating such
a dispute. Dr. Robert Kirshner, a Harvard astronomer and the
president of the American Astronomical Association, said, "I don't think
we have a method -- other than public tantrums --
to resolve these problems."
</P>
<P>
The imbroglio illustrates the ethical dangers and pitfalls of doing science
in the Internet age, where a little clicking can bring
you a shocking amount of information about what your colleagues
and rivals are up to.
</P>
<P>
There is a long history of astronomers jealously guarding the coordinates
of some celestial phenomenon while they try to figure out
what it is, and of others trying to get in
on the action. In 1930, when Pluto was discovered, the
Lowell Observatory, home of the discoverer Clyde Tombaugh, withheld details
of its location because they wanted to be the first
to calculate its orbit.
</P>
<P>
Matthew Holman, a Harvard planetary astronomer, said that in the old
days when the logbooks were real books sitting by the
telescope, some astronomers would write down fictitious coordinates and objects
to cover their tracks.
</P>
<P>
With electronic records, Brown said, "It's important for scientists to discuss
what's OK and what is not." Richard Pogge, an Ohio
State astronomer who uncovered the apparent breach, said that scientists
had long lived mostly successfully by a kind of honor
system. Astronomers, he said, routinely serve on time allocation committees
for telescopes and peer review panels without stealing one another's
ideas. "It allows us to have an open, collaborative community,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The idea that someone could abuse that openness, he said, "goes
to the whole idea of trust in our community."
</P>
<P>
Brown, with his colleagues Dr. David L. Rabinowitz of Yale and
Chadwick A. Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, is
currently famous as the discoverer of the "10th planet."
</P>
<P>
Ortiz, who received his Ph.D. from the University of Granada in
1994 for work on the clouds of Jupiter and Saturn,
is not as well known. Glenn Orton, of Caltech's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, where Ortiz worked as a postdoctoral fellow, called
him "an impressive worker" and said he had recommended him
for several jobs over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Since 2002, Ortiz and his colleagues have been looking for so-called
trans-Neptunian objects in the outer solar system with a brace
of small telescopes at the Sierra Nevada Observatory, in Granada.
</P>
<P>
The EL61 object appears to have been their first big hit.
According to Ortiz, it was first spotted on July 25
by Santos-Sanz as a slow-moving object on images taken in
March 2003. He e-mailed this news to the Minor Planet
Center on July 27, but it attracted no attention, partly
because there was not enough information to tell other observers
where to look for it.
</P>
<P>
The next night Ortiz reported that his group had been able
to trace the object on various old photographs back to
1955, enabling a group at the Astronomical Observatory of Mallorca
to observe it.
</P>
<P>
After checking for themselves that the object was real, Marsden's team
disseminated the details to the rest of the astronomical world
on its Web site and by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
The new body would have been a prize for any astronomer.
At the time it was the brightest and largest object
-- next to Pluto -- yet found in the Kuiper
belt, a ring of debris that stretches out beyond Neptune.
</P>
<P>
Except that it had already been discovered.
</P>
<P>
Brown had planned to report the object, which his team had
discovered in December 2004 and nicknamed Santa, at a meeting
last week. In fact, he had described it in abstracts
sent to the American Astronomical Society, abstracts available to anyone
with a computer and familiarity with astronomical jargon, only a
week before, on July 20.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz's report raised eyebrows at the astronomical union because he and
his telescopes were relatively unknown and because two years had
elapsed since the discovery pictures were taken. Struck by the
similarity of the objects and the close timing of Ortiz's
announcement, Marsden said he had told Brown that he was
worried that a leak might have occurred.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Brown himself had inadvertently made such a leak possible.
</P>
<P>
In the abstracts he referred to "Santa" by a code name,
K40506A, which was the same code name his team had
used in its observing logs. As a result, as Brown
discovered to his horror the night of Ortiz's announcement, any
astronomer who read the abstracts and typed "K40506A" into an
Internet search program would be taken to a Web site
containing the observing logs of Smarts, the Small and Moderate
Aperture Research Telescope System. It was one of those telescopes,
at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, that Brown
and his colleagues were using to track the object.
</P>
<P>
The telescope is one of four owned by a consortium of
universities and operated by two observing assistants at the observatory.
The Web site, which is public, does not contain data
obtained during observations but does tell where the telescope was
pointed.
</P>
<P>
Shaken by that news that his observations were so accessible, Brown
hastily called a news conference to announce his ace in
the hole, a new planet bigger than Pluto, at 7
p.m. on Friday, July 29, "Perhaps the single best time
to announce news that you want no one to hear,"
as he put it on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
In an e-mail message, he apologized to Ortiz ahead of time
for being about to overshadow him.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless questions lingered among minor planet astronomers about whether Ortiz's group
might have helped themselves to Brown's observing logs, suspicions that
Ortiz found irritating.
</P>
<P>
"I do not enjoy the distrust on our work and so
much questioning," he wrote to Dr. Daniel Green of the
astronomical union on Aug. 5 in an e-mail message, which
Green provided to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
But now evidence has been offered that Ortiz and his group
did access the observing logs. Prompted by questions by Rabinowitz
of Yale, one of Brown's team members, Pogge, who maintains
the Smarts telescope Web site, decided to investigate the traffic
on the site.
</P>
<P>
He found that computers from an unfamiliar address had visited the
Web site eight times from July 26 to 28, when
the Spanish group was making its announcement. Each time the
computers went straight to pages deep within the site that
described the Brown group's observations of K40506A.
</P>
<P>
The first three visits happened a few minutes apart early on
July 26, a day and a half before the Ortiz
group made its announcement. Another cluster of hits came on
the morning of the July 28 before the object was
observed in Mallorca and Ortiz made his more complete report
to the astronomical union.
</P>
<P>
Pogge was able to trace the computers through the so-called IPP
numbers, which the Internet assigns to each computer on it.
Those numbers eventually led him to the Web site of
the Andalusian Institute. Pogge said he gasped out loud when
it popped up.
</P>
<P>
"I remember saying, 'Oh no, oh no, oh no,' over and
over again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the IPP numbers of the intruders match the numbers on
the e-mail messages Santos-Sanz and Ortiz sent to the Minor
Planet office, according to Marsden. Pogge called Brown on Aug.
8. Brown in turn sent an e-mail message to Ortiz
asking for an explanation, but by then all of Spain
seemed to be on vacation.
</P>
<P>
It was not until early this month that Iniesta and Ortiz
wrote back, the latter to say that he was still
on vacation and saw no need to respond further until
Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of further information, exactly what Ortiz did with
the observing logs is likely to remain a mystery. Were
he and his colleagues only checking to see if Brown's
object was the same as theirs to confirm their own
discovery? Or did they use the information to find the
object and beat the Caltech team?
</P>
<P>
Both actions would violate scientific ethics but with varying degrees of
seriousness, astronomers said.
</P>
<P>
John Huchra, an astronomer and the vice provost for research policy
at Harvard, said that at some level it is all
right to use knowledge of what a rival group is
doing. "If you hear them give a talk at a
conference, it's fair game," he said, "but if you found
it in the trash bin or the copier, that's not
kosher."
</P>
<P>
If you used tainted information to beat out the other group,
he said, the director of the observatory (the only authority
in this system) could forbid publication and banish you from
the telescope. "If they were just confirming," he went on,
"there's still a tinge here. It's not kosher to point
your telescope at somebody else's object, unless you ask."
</P>
<P>
Ben Oppenheimer, an astronomer and extrasolar planet hunter at the American
Museum of Natural History, said that he thought it was
unethical to use tainted information in any way, but added:
"It's a borderline case, though, because the logs were public.
I don't know why that information was so freely available."
</P>
<P>
One complicating factor is that professionals like Brown tend to nurse
their work along in private until they are ready to
publish a major scientific paper. This practice has sometimes created
tension among the minor planet observers, including a large number
of amateurs who take pride in spotting comets, uncharted asteroids
and other objects before the professionals. In his response to
Brown, Ortiz offered to collaborate with him on the naming
of 2003 EL61 if Brown would change his secretive ways.
</P>
<P>
Brown called Ortiz's e-mail message "astonishing."
</P>
<P>
Regarding the practice of guarding his data, he said, "This is
what every single scientist does every day of their lives."
</P>
<P>
Marsden pointed out that Brown had advanced science while he was
keeping his "Santa" object under observation. He discovered that it
has a moon, nicknamed Rudolph, allowing him to calculate the
object's mass -- about one-third that of Pluto.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he did report it, said Marsden, citing the abstracts.
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame him for wanting to finish the job," Marsden
said. "You do the whole thing. That is how astronomy
is done, or used to be done."
</P>
<P>
Marsden, who is secretary of astronomical union's committee for naming small
bodies, said that he would suggest to Brown that he
propose names for both 2003 EL61 and its satellite.

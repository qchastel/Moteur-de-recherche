Fast Mission to Pluto Is Measured in Years
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's plenty of gray hair on the heads of scientists leading the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's New Horizons mission
to Pluto. But they all vow they'll still be on the job when their
unmanned spacecraft reaches the farthest planet from the sun -- in
July 2015.
</P>
<P>
``Yes, we'll all be there,'' said Glen Fountain, 63, the mission's
project manager at the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics
Laboratory near Laurel, Md., where New Horizons was planned and built.
</P>
<P>
The team's pledge to stick with the job could become tougher to
fulfill than they'd like. The $700 million project is set to launch
Jan. 17 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida -- the first
flight ever to Pluto and the longest mission ever planned, with the
fastest spacecraft ever.
</P>
<P>
But so vast is the distance -- Pluto averages 3.7 billion miles
from the sun, about 40 times farther than Earth -- that a four-week
delay in launch will cost the mission's silver-haired captains five
additional years, until 2020, before their work pays off. An extended
mission to regions beyond Pluto could add seven more years.
</P>
<P>
They're willing to wait. As dark, cold and far away as it is,
``Pluto is a treasure trove of scientific discoveries waiting to be
uncovered,'' Andrew Dantzler, 43, director of NASA's solar system
division, told reporters this week at NASA headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Pluto, named after the Roman god of the underworld, is unlike any
other planet in the solar system, he said, and ``as such, it holds
many clues to how the solar system was formed, also perhaps how other
systems formed.''
</P>
<P>
Pluto was the last of the nine planets to be discovered -- in 1930
by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh. It orbits the sun at distances
ranging from 2.8 billion to 4.6 billion miles. If Earth were in
Baltimore, and Mars (at its closest) were 40 miles away in Washington,
a spacecraft would have to fly 4,000 miles -- to Geneva, Switzerland
-- to reach Pluto.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to that distance and Pluto's tiny size, even the Hubble
Space Telescope has managed only the crudest images of the planet's
mottled surface. Its largest moon, Charon, wasn't discovered until
1978. Hubble scientists spotted two more moons only last May.
</P>
<P>
So planetary scientists are understandably impatient for a closer
look at this oddball planet. Smaller than Earth's moon, Pluto circles
the sun once in 248 Earth years. It is neither a rocky planet like
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, nor a gas giant like Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it's mostly rock, water, nitrogen, carbon monoxide and
methane, all frozen at minus-387 degrees Fahrenheit. In 1988,
scientists discovered that some of Pluto's ices escape as gas to form
a tenuous atmosphere that changes with the planet's seasons.
</P>
<P>
The mission's top scientist, Alan Stern, 48, of Southwest Research
Institute in Boulder, Colo., described Pluto as ``a scientific
wonderland for atmospheric scientists.''
</P>
<P>
Even so, planetary experts have long debated whether Pluto is even
a planet. In the 1950s, Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper
suggested Pluto might belong to a population of ice balls thought to
orbit the sun beyond Neptune. He theorized that the icy realm is the
source of comets that periodically zip through the inner solar system.
Since 1992, astronomers have found more than 1,000 of these objects,
more than 5 billion miles from the sun, in what they now call the
``Kuiper Belt.'' They range in size from 30 to 1,250 miles across.
</P>
<P>
Although some astronomers argue that Pluto isn't a planet but
rather the king of the Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), Stern insists the
big KBOs have now qualified as planets, like Pluto -- which would give
our solar system far more than the nine planets identified in science
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
They qualify, he said, because they're large enough for their own
gravity to pull them into a spherical shape.
</P>
<P>
Scientists' fascination with Pluto and the KBOs is rooted in the
notion that these objects are frozen keys to the solar system's
formation 4.5 billion years ago. That's why the National Academy of
Science ranked a mission to Pluto, and the Kuiper Belt beyond, as the
highest priority for U.S. space science in this decade.
</P>
<P>
The challenge for APL's designers was to build a spacecraft that
could survive a 10- or 15-year journey through the coldest, darkest
reaches of the solar system and arrive ready to work.
</P>
<P>
The first requirement was speed. New Horizons weighs 1,000 pounds,
but it will be hurled toward Pluto by NASA's most powerful rocket, an
Atlas V packing 2.4 million pounds of thrust. So the craft will leave
Earth's orbit at 36,000 mph. That's about 8 miles per second -- all it
needs to reach Pluto.
</P>
<P>
At that speed, it will pass the moon's orbit in nine hours, a leap
that took Apollo astronauts three days. It will pass Jupiter in a
little over a year, five years quicker than NASA's Galileo mission.
And mission managers hope to use the giant planet's gravity to boost
New Horizons' speed to 47,000 mph -- 10.5 miles per second.
</P>
<P>
Traveling too far from the sun to rely on solar energy for heat and
electricity, New Horizons will be powered by a radioisotope
thermoelectric generator (RTG), which converts the heat from decaying
plutonium 238 directly to electricity. It's the same technology used
on the Cassini mission to Saturn and 23 other U.S. space probes.
</P>
<P>
New Horizons also was built with minimal power demands -- less than
two 100-watt bulbs for all its work at Pluto. Its scientific
instruments draw between 2 and 10 watts each, and they're packed
inside a heat-conservingThermos-like container 2 feet by 7 feet by 9
feet in size.
</P>
<P>
To avoid years of wear and tear on the craft's systems, planners
programmed it to hibernate through most of its voyage beyond Jupiter.
It will send home a weekly ``I'm OK'' tone, but awaken only once a
year for 50 days of checkups, routine maintenance and course
corrections.
</P>
<P>
The first test of New Horizons' suite of seven cameras,
spectrometers and other scientific instruments will come as it passes
Jupiter next winter, passing three times closer than Cassini's 2000
flyby en route to Saturn.
</P>
<P>
But the scientific focus is on Pluto and its moons. Scientists hope
to begin receiving pictures of Pluto five months before the
spacecraft's closest approach. Surface mapping will begin two months
later, from a range of 60 million miles.
</P>
<P>
The biggest day for scientists will be when New Horizons flies past
Pluto at a distance of 16,800 miles. Cameras and spectrometers will
snap pictures of the planet and its moons, mapping details as small as
80 feet across -- 10,000 times Hubble's resolution. Instruments also
will send back data on the composition, temperature and atmosphere of
the Plutonian system.
</P>
<P>
Because of the huge volume of information and slow download rates
at that vast distance, it will take nine months to transmit all the
data back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
After the Pluto encounter, if NASA provides the money, mission
planners want to send the spacecraft deep into the Kuiper Belt, to
explore at least two other KBOs during the next five to seven years,
promising more discoveries -- even if some of the original team
members have moved on -- or retired.

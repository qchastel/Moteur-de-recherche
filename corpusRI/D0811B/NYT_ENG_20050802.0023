EDITORIAL: TOO MANY PLANETS NUMB THE MIND
</HEADLINE>

The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Aug.

When a Caltech astronomer, Michael Brown, announced last year that his
team had found a distant object three-fourths the size of
Pluto orbiting the sun, he declined to call it a
planet, and he even suggested that Pluto should not be
considered a planet either. There was, he said, just no
good scientific rationale for considering either of those distant bodies
in the same league as the eight indisputable planets that
circle the sun at closer range.
</P>
<P>
Now Brown has found something orbiting the sun that's bigger than
Pluto and even farther away. He's changed his mind and
proposed that Pluto keep its designation, and that the new
object, an extremely big lump of ice and rock, should
also be deemed a planet. There was still no good
scientific rationale for the judgment, he admitted, but this was
a case where habit -- 75 years of calling Pluto
a planet -- should trump any scientific definition.
</P>
<P>
There is no real debate that the four terrestrial planets --
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars -- and the four gaseous
giants -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- deserve their
status as planets. But scientists have long been uneasy about
including Pluto, an icy ball, smaller than our moon, whose
orbit is more eccentric than the others and tilts in
a different plane.
</P>
<P>
Try as they might, scientists could not come up with a
definition that would retain Pluto as a planet without requiring
that scads of other objects be deemed planets as well.
Nor could they satisfy the legions of space enthusiasts who
remain certain from their grade-school lessons that there are nine
planets -- no more, no less.
</P>
<P>
So now Brown proposes that scientists give up the battle and
accept a cultural definition of what a planet is. It's
either the nine planets we learned about in grade school,
or those nine plus any newfound object orbiting the sun
that turns out to be bigger than Pluto. He opts
for the latter approach on the theory that most people,
deep down, accept that definition. This definition would also, of
course, qualify Brown for the historical footnotes as the discoverer
of a new planet.
</P>
<P>
Our own preference is to take a cleaner way out by
dropping Pluto from the planetary ranks. Scientists may well discover
many more ice balls bigger than Pluto, and it's a
safe bet that few in our culture want to memorize
the names of 20 or more planets. Far better to
downgrade Pluto to the status of an icy sphere that
was once mistakenly deemed a planet because we had not
yet discovered its compatriots on the dark fringes of the
solar system.

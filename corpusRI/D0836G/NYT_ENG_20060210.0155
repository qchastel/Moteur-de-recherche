DESIGN WITH HISTORY IN MIND: Homeowners can experience a little bit
of Americana every day with Karastan's new carpet collection inspired
by historic landmarks. The company has partnered with the National
Trust for Historic Preservation to create a collection called Design
in America -- The National Trust. Karastan created 10 carpets
featuring eight patterned designs and two coordinates. To do so,
the company's design team visited several properties under the watch
of the National Trust. The team then reinterpreted the architectural
and color styles into newly updated tufted floor coverings. The
styles range from Gothic revival and turn-of-the-century English manor to
Georgian. The inaugural designs for this collection were inspired by
historic properties including Brucemore in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Drayton Hall
in Charleston, S.C.; Filoli and Oatlands in Woodside, Calif.; Lyndhurst
Castle in Tarrytown, N.Y.; and Shadow-on-the-Teche in New Iberia, La.

The National Trust is a nonprofit organization dedicated to saving historic
places by raising funds and awareness of the need to
preserve the sites.
</P>
<P>
The new designs will be available to the public in February,
and a portion of proceeds generated will go to the
National Trust. For more information, call Karastan at (800) 234-1120,
or visit www.karastan.com. For information on the National Trust, visit

SPIRITED CABINETS: Give those wine and spirits bottles a beautiful place
to be displayed with Howard Miller's Wine &amp; Spirits Furniture
collection. The line features more than 25 fashion-forward designs made
with a variety of finishes such as Rustic Cherry, Black
Coffee, Black Satin and Heirloom Oak on select hardwoods. Wine
collectors can show off their appreciation of the grape with
designs that accentuate their own style. Use your imagination with
the Belmont, which has a modular design that allows you
to design your own cabinet. Its hutch and three base
units allow mixing and matching. The base unit is available
in three styles: a drawer and wine rack with a
30-bottle capacity, a drawer and left-hinged cabinet door, and a
drawer with a right-hinged door

For those who love old-fashioned kitchen decor, the Madrid is designed
with a wine and food lover in mind. The baker
rack-style wine cabinet features a hanging stemware rack, wine rack,
drawers and prep shelf. It is made with Americana Cherry
finish and veneers with scrolling metal accents. The glass mirrored
back adds to your stemware display.
</P>
<P>
These are just a few examples of the collection. Some designs
feature floor levelers to adjust for uneven surfaces and carpeted
floors; others have lights for easy visibility in the dark
and locks to keep wine secure.
</P>
<P>
The suggested retail price for the cabinets ranges from $339 to
$3,035. The cabinets are available at local stores including California
Furniture Galleries in Canoga Park, Roma Interiors Gallery in North
Hollywood and Home Depot Expo in Westwood. For more information

PROTECT CLOTHES WITH CEDAR: Rediscover the protective benefits of cedar without
breaking the bank with CedarSafe Natural Closet Liners. Studies indicate
that the aromatic properties of cedar wood, especially the aromatic
Eastern red cedar, protect clothes from pests such as moths,
cockroaches, silverfish and carpet beetles. CedarSafe has developed a cost-effective
way to transform your closet into a beautiful cedar closet
with solid cedar panels or planks. A box of planks
covers 15 square feet of wall space and provides an
elegant look to master bedroom closets, while the panels work
best in storage areas, secondary closets and attics. The panels
are sold individually or as part of a four-piece Project
Pak. The planks come in sizes that can be cut
to random lengths. The suggested retail price for the planks
is $29.95 and the panels retail at $24.95 each. CedarSafe
products can be found at most home improvement stores such
as Home Depot, Lowes, ACE, and True Value hardware stores.

NONSLIP BAMBOO RUGS: Bamboo is one of the strongest and most
versatile materials in the world. From bamboo houses to floors
and furniture, it has increasingly become popular in the world
of home decor. Anji Mountain Bamboo Rug Co. has contributed
to this phenomenon with its high-quality bamboo and newly introduced
sisal and sea grass rugs. The 2006 collection also features
colored and silk-screened bamboo rugs and features mixed rugs made
with two types of material, providing for more flexibility in
adding colors and patterns. The bamboo rugs previously featured natural
fiber backing, but the new nonslip backing allows for equal
if not better resistance to water, mold and mildew, and
costs about the same. Due to the nonslip backing, a
greater number of rugs can be used in indoor and
outdoor areas such as entryways, foyers, dining rooms and patios.
They provide a beautiful accent to any room and floor.
</P>
<P>
The bamboo rugs are expertly kiln-dried and carbonized to prevent cracking
and warping. The multiple layers of polyurethane coating also protect
against scratching and staining. And better yet, the rugs are
environmentally friendly since they come from carefully controlled, renewable bamboo
forests.
</P>
<P>
The rugs come in a wide variety of sizes and eye-catching
colors and patterns, and can be ordered in custom sizes.
The suggested retail price for the rugs ranges from $19.95
to $259.95. They are available nationwide at stores such as
Home Depot and Carpet One, and online at www.area-rugs.org. For
more information, call (888) 344-5004.

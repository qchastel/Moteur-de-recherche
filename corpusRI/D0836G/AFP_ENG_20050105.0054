<P>
India's Supreme Court lifted Wednesday 
a ban on felling timber in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to allow 
houses to be built for thousands of tsunami survivors.
</P>
<P>
The court had imposed the ban two years ago to protect the 
tropical forests on the Andamans, but the devastation wreaked by the 
tsunami destroyed entire settlements.
</P>
<P>
Cracks and fissures have developed in many concrete buildings 
still standing on the islands which have been jolted by about 100 
aftershocks since the December 26 earthquake off Indonesia sent 
tsunamis across the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Indian experts have been dispatched to the islands to build 
makeshift houses from bamboo and other woods, which can better 
withstand quakes and are less likely to injure inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government says at least 900 people have died and 
more than 6,000 are missing on the Andamans.
</P>
<P>
Some 40,000 people have been housed in 110 relief camps on the 
islands, according to home ministry figures.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall picture remains uncertain with locals, 
police and aid workers fearing 10,000 people died across the 
500-plus island chain which stretches more than 800 kilometres (500 
miles).

Forestry experts in northwest 
China's Gansu Province have identified in a recently concluded 
survey more than 20 insects that plague arrow bamboo, a major food
for giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
An expert panel of the Gansu Provincial Science and Technology 
Department, headed by zoologist Wang Hongjian, spent the past 
three years studying insect pests in 478 square kilometers of 
bamboo forests -- about 79 percent of the total -- in Baishuijiang
Nature Reserve, home to 102 giant pandas and at least 20 varieties
of bamboos.
</P>
<P>
The experts collected more than 20,000 specimens of 
bamboo-eating insects, including various species of moths, aphids 
and bugs, studied their living habits and life cycles, and worked 
out efficient and pollution-free pesticides that have proven an 
average effectiveness of 86.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey was launched in 2002 in an effort to identify and 
curb the plague of insect pests and improve the quality of arrow 
bamboos to provide the best possible food resources for giant 
pandas.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua Thursday, Wang said preservation of
arrow bamboo is an important step in China's conservation of giant
pandas. "Insect plagues are just as harmful as flowering arrow 
bamboo, but the former issue has not received as much attention as
it deserves in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said insect pests are deteriorating in recent years in 
Baishuijiang Nature Reserve, located in the southernmost part of 
Gansu Province and bordering Sichuan Province. "In the worst 
affected areas, bamboos have withered and died."
</P>
<P>
According to a 1996-1998 forestry survey, nearly half of the 
reserve's 608 square kilometers of bamboo forests were plagued by 
insects, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Pandas are among the world's most endangered wild animals. 
According to statistics from the State Forestry Administration 
released in 2004, the number of pandas in the wild in China has 
risen by more than 40 percent from 1,110 in the 1980s to 1,590 
today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 161 giant pandas are kept in captivity at 
worldwide zoos. Pandas mainly live in mountainous areas in 
Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.

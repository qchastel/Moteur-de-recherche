Incorrect preparation of raw cassava and fresh bamboo shoots can lead
to exposure to naturally occurring hydrogen cyanide, Australia's food
watchdog warned on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a new advice for the preparation of raw cassava and
fresh bamboo shoots prior to consumption issued by Food Standards
Australia New Zealand, there is the potential for cassava and bamboo
shoots to cause harm if the food is not prepared properly.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that if someone purchases either raw cassava or
bamboo shoots and does not know the correct preparation instructions
there is a health risk," Acting General Manager for Food Standards
(Australia) Paul Brent said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Cassava is safe to eat providing that the raw cassava is properly
prepared by first peeling and slicing the cassava and then cooking it
by baking, boiling or roasting," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The correct preparation of fresh bamboo shoots involves cutting the
shoots in half lengthways, removing any outer leaves and fibrous
tissue at the base, then thinly slicing the shoots into strips and
boiling them for eight to 10 minutes in lightly salted water," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Processed cassava, such as tapioca, cassava chips or cassava flour
present little or no health risk as the processing removes the
toxins.
</P>
<P>
Cassava is a tropical root crop similar to taro and yam. Bamboo
shoots are a traditional component of Asian cuisine.
</P>
<P>
Food Standards Australia New Zealand is a bi-national independent
statutory authority that develops food standards for composition,
labeling and contaminants, including microbiological limits, that
apply to all foods produced or imported for sale in Australia and New
Zealand.

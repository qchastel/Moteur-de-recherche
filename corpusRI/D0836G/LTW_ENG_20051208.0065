The National Zoo's giant panda cub, Tai Shan, didn't
just happen -- he was brought to you by scientists who spent years
studying the intimate details of black-and-white bear biology before
they mastered artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
A recent surge in giant panda science is helping zoos get more
animals pregnant, diagnose when they are expecting and put to rest the
long-held belief that pandas are poor breeders. The research is
producing insights into how pandas communicate, how mothers raise
their young and how the animals look for food.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal is to increase the giant panda's chances in the
wilds of China, where only about 1,600 remain, threatened mainly by
the loss of bamboo forests to logging and development. Scientists are
studying the panda's basic survival needs and are trying to build up
the number of captive animals so that some could be set loose in
potential panda territory.
</P>
<P>
Money for the studies has come largely from the four U.S. zoos that
have giant pandas -- including the National Zoo, where Tai Shan went on
public display Thursday.
</P>
<P>
``I am not sure we know of any endangered species where we have
this amount of information,'' said National Zoo senior scientist David
Wildt.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, a high-ranking Chinese wildlife official,
Yan Xun, underscored the cooperation between U.S. and Chinese
scientists: ``We have achieved a lot of accomplishments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Tai Shan's birth in July was the result of years of research
efforts. Many experts believed that giant pandas were poor breeders
because they seldom got pregnant in zoos and because females are
fertile only two or three days a year. But that idea crumbled after
U.S. and Chinese scientists examined dozens of captive pandas in the
late 1990s and found most biologically fit to breed.
</P>
<P>
``We have every reason to believe that pandas in the wild are doing
all right as far as opportunities for pregnancy are concerned,'' said
Donald Lindburg, head of the giant panda team at the San Diego Zoo,
where three cubs have been born. ``This is more of a captive
phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
Artificial insemination is one way around the obstacle of
persuading pandas to breed naturally. National Zoo scientists have
been working since the 1980s on monitoring hormone changes to tell
whether a female is fertile. Scientists there and at other zoos ramped
up the research in the late 1990s, when China began lending panda
pairs to U.S. animal parks.
</P>
<P>
National Zoo keepers trained their female, Mei Xiang, to sit still
for medical tests. Scientists created a mobile lab to track hormone
changes in her urine and improved testing to get results faster. They
watched for behavior changes that indicated she was ready.
</P>
<P>
``Short of crawling inside her abdomen,'' reproductive scientist
JoGayle Howard said, ``I don't think you can get any better timing.''
</P>
<P>
Zoo scientists hoped that Mei Xiang and the male panda, Tian Tian,
would mate naturally last spring, but when that did not happen, they
stepped in as the female's short window of fertility was about to
close. Howard e-mailed regular updates of Mei Xiang's test results to
San Diego Zoo scientists, who suggested a specific time to perform
artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
With Mei Xiang under anesthesia the morning of March 11, Howard
employed a tiny laparoscope with a light to perform the procedure, the
first time that particular type of instrument was used on a giant
panda.
</P>
<P>
``It's remarkable,'' Lindburg said. ``They had one vial; they had
enough sperm for one insemination. They had a single event, and they
nailed it.''
</P>
<P>
Zoo managers would prefer that pandas breed on their own, and one
line of research is trying to foster that. A major discovery is that
pandas get to know each other through their noses. A male panda can
tell whether a female is in heat by sniffing her urine or the scent
marks she leaves behind. Each panda has an individual scent.
</P>
<P>
In the past, zoos raised males and females separately, putting them
together only for mating. Often, that resulted in fights, not cubs.
``When animals are introduced for breeding, they need time to become
familiar with each other, scent-wise, before they are put together,''
said Rebecca Snyder, curator of giant panda research at Zoo Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
So Chinese zoos often keep several young pandas together so they
can get to know each other as they grow up. The zoos also let
breeding-age animals sniff each other's scent before meeting. Some
scientists think this research suggests that if giant pandas were
reintroduced in the wild, their chances would improve if their scent
were spread around their new territory beforehand, staking their
claim.
</P>
<P>
Scientists also have studied panda personality. Former National Zoo
researcher David Powell, now at the Bronx Zoo, developed an exam
intended to give zoos rapid assessments of how to care for new
animals. He tested 38 pandas in China to measure their general
activity, along with their level of interest in a new toy.
</P>
<P>
``That will tell you right away this animal adjusts well to change,
or I have to be quiet around this animal,'' Powell said. ``We've made
a lot of progress in behavior management and husbandry.''
</P>
<P>
Long range, some zoo scientists think the personality test could
help them improve panda breeding -- they could, for example, provide
hiding places for a shy female that might be reluctant to mate.
</P>
<P>
Zoos still haven't solved the mystery of knowing when a giant panda
is expecting. It was not until Mei Xiang gave birth that the National
Zoo knew for sure that she was pregnant. Scientists would like a
definitive pregnancy test so they can reduce stress on animals that
might lead them to abandon their young, which weigh only a
quarter-pound at birth.
</P>
<P>
Hormone tests still cannot detect the difference between a real
pregnancy and the common false pregnancy in pandas. Ultrasound is
promising, but some pandas won't sit still for it. San Diego
scientists are experimenting with a technique called thermal imaging,
measuring whether a mother's blood flow is increasing, which is one
sign of a developing embryo.
</P>
<P>
``We're still doing very basic work with the giant panda,'' said
National Zoo research veterinarian Steve Monfort. ``We still have a
long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
Snyder, the Atlanta scientist, has looked at how mothers raise
their young, finding that they hold their tiny infants 80 percent of
the time during the crucial first three months. Males and females are
raised differently, she concluded. And, so far, she has found little
difference in mothering style between experienced and new mothers.
</P>
<P>
Other studies focus on how pandas look for food and what they like
to eat. Bamboo is their main diet, and they spend much of the day
eating because bamboo has so little nutrition that they need a lot of
it. The Memphis Zoo is assembling a bamboo database of hundreds of
samples and analyzing their nutritional value. The zoo also tested a
variety of bamboo on its two pandas, hoping to offer guidance to
wildlife managers scouting for places in which to reintroduce pandas
to the wild.
</P>
<P>
``They switch bamboo species through the year and switch the parts
they eat -- sometimes leaves and sometimes stalks,'' said Matthew
Thompson, the zoo's large mammal curator. ``In the spring, they like
to eat shoots.''
</P>
<P>
Most giant panda studies have been done on zoo animals, and the
next frontier will be tracking the elusive animals in the wild.
Chinese officials have been reluctant to allow giant pandas to be
fitted with radio collars that would make it easier to track them.
</P>
<P>
``A very big question for all of us is whether or not the
information we've gleaned from watching animals in captivity echoes
what is going on in the wild,'' San Diego's Lindburg said.
</P>
<P>
Giant panda research has had another payoff. U.S. zoo scientists
have trained dozens of their Chinese counterparts to test hormones,
map panda territory on computers and learn other wildlife skills.
National Zoo reproductive scientist Howard hopes that cheetahs, maned
wolves and other rare species could benefit from the artificial
insemination device she developed for Mei Xiang. Her colleague Monfort
said zoos are developing hormone measurement tests for other types of
animals, modeled on the giant panda work.
</P>
<P>
``We've got a lot of ideas now that we're ready to try on other
species,'' Howard said.

<P>
The French government on Monday approved 
an extension of emergency powers for three months in order to subdue 
a wave of rioting in poor city suburbs around the country.
</P>
<P>
Meeting under the chairmanship of President Jacques Chirac, the 
cabinet agreed on a bill to maintain the state of emergency which 
came into effect last Wednesday under a 50-year-old law.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be put to parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said the extension was "a strictly temporary measure 
which will be applied only where it is strictly necessary," 
according to government spokesman Jean-Francois Cope.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency applies in most of the country's riot-hit 
towns and cities, but has been invoked sparingly by the 
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 localities are under nightly curfews for under 
16-year-olds, and two temporary bans on public gatherings have been 
imposed in Paris and Lyon.

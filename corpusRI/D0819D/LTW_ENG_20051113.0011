Examining the Role of French Police
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MELUN, France
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Eric Peterle emerged from the fray on a
recent night carrying a heavy grate about the size of his head.
</P>
<P>
An hour before, a rioter had torn the grate from the drain of an
apartment building and hurled it at the riot squad commander. When
Peterle returned to headquarters, the object in his brawny hand became
evidence -- of a crime and of the nihilistic fury of France's worst
riots in decades.
</P>
<P>
Peterle's unit had first seen action in the epicenter of the
unrest, the grim gangways of housing projects in Clichy-Sous-Bois near
Paris. Later, they redeployed about 30 miles south to this seemingly
tranquil, stone-walled town where metropolitan sprawl ends in meadows.
In both places, rioters bombarded them with everything from rocks,
bricks and Molotov cocktails to shopping carts and the wreckage of a
telephone booth.
</P>
<P>
``Luckily, the guy who threw this thing missed,'' said Peterle, a
close-cropped 42-year-old with an armor-plated build forged in 17
years of close-quarters combat.
</P>
<P>
While the anti-riot officers brawled in the glare of flames and
cameras, officers of the national police intelligence division led the
shadow war. In a discreet headquarters near Paris last week, rumpled
and unshaven officers in jeans, sweaters and scarves worked a legion
of informants. There was a barrage of tips and rumors: firebombs
stockpiled in a basement, arsonists scheming hit-and-run incursions
far from the riot zones, Islamic fundamentalists keeping a
mysteriously low profile.
</P>
<P>
The officers consulted with mayors, businessmen, teachers, imams.
Their unique knowledge of the landscape made them the brains of a
battle against a guerrilla-style foe in which at least 208 officers
were injured.
</P>
<P>
In conversations over the past two weeks of violence, a dozen
officers from different units, ranks and cities said they were
exhausted, dismayed but not surprised by the nationwide rampage.
</P>
<P>
For years, the officers said, the police had warned that France's
immigrant-dominated slums were on the verge of explosion, a
slow-motion riot about to fast-forward. Culture clashes and economic
woes had created a lost generation of mostly Muslim youths seething
with hostility toward the state. Wrong-headed ideology had caused
governments to pull back from low-income housing projects allowing
parallel societies ruled by criminal and extremist networks to
flourish, officers said.
</P>
<P>
And several veterans agree with critics who say that France's
rigid, paramilitary policing culture aggravated tensions between
youths and officers. Even before the riots, an average of 3,500 cars a
month were burned nationwide.
</P>
<P>
``We didn't predict the hour and the day,'' said a police
intelligence chief, who asked to remain anonymous for security
reasons. ``But it was all reported: the chasm between youths and
society, the power of the criminal economy, the isolation of the
projects where it is basically youths vs. cops. Because there is
nothing. No movie theaters, no restaurants, nothing to do. The only
face of the state is the police.''
</P>
<P>
The overall violence has declined markedly from its peak, but it
continued this weekend, mainly in provincial regions. France's police
are proud of their restraint and discipline during the onslaught.
Remarkably, police have not fired a single shot, even when shot at on
half a dozen occasions. There has only been one death, a retiree
beaten by a youth, and few serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, critics say defects of French policing were
among the fuses for the explosion. The French police excel at
intelligence, investigations and crowd control, say academic experts
and European and U.S. investigators. But in a hierarchical system,
intelligence tends to flow up the command chain, not to other officers
in the field. And experts say police here are weaker at basic beat-cop
patrolling, an area vital to the dramatic reduction of crime and
unrest in American cities in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Like other European countries, the French system differs greatly
from the city police departments of the United States. The police here
are a national force led by chiefs in Paris. In the provinces, police
forces answer not to mayors but to civilian regional administrators
known as prefects.
</P>
<P>
It's routine for officers, many of whom come from small cities or
towns, to start their careers in far-off regions and spend their
careers trying to land a post closer to home. In keeping with the
military model, Peterle's riot division is housed in bases outside big
cities and dispatched all over the country to handle unrest,
demonstrations or security for major events.
</P>
<P>
For patrol officers, the violent, dilapidated housing projects in
the industrial belt around Paris are often the first assignment.
Rookies find themselves stuck in a harrowing job in an expensive
region. They are often scared and bewildered by the mosaic of foreign
cultures in the projects: African women in colorful tribal robes,
aging bearded Algerians in Islamic garb, defiant second- and
third-generation youths in hip-hop regalia.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the youths often see police as unwanted representatives of
a distant state, said Dominique Monjardet, a sociologist at the
National Center for Scientific Research.
</P>
<P>
``The urban patrol officer is not an element of the community like
the shop owner, the bus driver,'' Monjardet said. ``For the police,
all local contact is seen as potentially corrupting. . . . The rookies
don't know the turf. They don't like it. They don't know how to handle
it. They have three years to spend there and they are counting the
days. They are young, so it becomes youths against youths, like two
gangs.''

French authorities have attempted reforms similar to those in the
United States, such as ``community policing'' and Compstat, a
results-driven management technique pioneered by Los Angeles Police
Chief Bill Bratton in New York. But the experiments have been
half-hearted, Monjardet said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, many beat cops see their mission as clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
``In the media it's always analysis, sociology,'' said Cmdr. Eric
Slangen, who from headquarters here in Melun oversees patrol
operations in a vast sector east and south of Paris. ``Police have to
focus on facts, because we can't analyze causes, we aren't there for
that. We are there to see what happens and react and arrest people. .
. . There's a tendency to ask police to play bigger role than the one
we have.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Often, the top brass in Paris give patrol divisions little support
or direction, favoring prized detective units that investigate major
crimes such as armed robbery, mafias and terrorism, Monjardet said. As
a result, most beat cops have few anti-crime tools beyond stopping
youths for repeated identity checks, which leads to complaints of
harassment and discrimination, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Patrice Ribeiro of the Synergie Officiers police union said
that political ideology has handcuffed police during the past three
decades, in effect handing over public housing to entrenched criminal
networks that deal in drugs and stolen goods. The trend began with
leftist governments in the 1980s and continued with rightist leaders,
he said.
</P>
<P>
``For years, we had instructions not to go into the projects,''
Ribeiro said. ``There was an ideology that it was a provocation. So we
left a lot of people with the idea that it was their turf and police
weren't supposed to intrude. . . . We abandoned all those people, and
most of them are honest people. We abandoned them in neighborhoods
that have rotted.''

PARIS, Nov 11
</DATELINE>

<P>
Two weeks after an outbreak of urban 
rioting in France, sparked by anger in Paris's poor outer suburbs 
over the accidental deaths of two teenagers, here are the key facts 
and figures about the violence.
</P>
<P>
- HOTSPOTS: Some 300 towns and cities were affected at the 
height of the riots, particularly the outer Parisian suburbs of 
Clichy-sous-Bois, Aulnay-sous-Bois, Saint-Denis and Grigny.
</P>
<P>
Regional cities hardest hit included Evreux, west of Paris, 
Lille in the north, central Saint-Etienne and Toulouse in the 
southwest.
</P>
<P>
Other outbreaks occurred in Nice, Marseille, Nimes, Montpellier, 
Perpignan and Pau in the south; Bordeaux, Nantes and Rennes in the 
west; Clermont-Ferrand, Tours and Lyon in central France; Rouen and 
Le Havre in Normandy; and Strasbourg to the east.
</P>
<P>
Around 11,500 police and gendarmes were mobilised throughout the 
country. Seven helicopters were deployed in the Ile-de-France region 
encompassing Paris.
</P>
<P>
- VICTIMS: Retiree Jean-Jacques Le Chenadec, 61, died Monday 
three days after being punched near his apartment building northeast 
of Paris.
</P>
<P>
More than 115 residents, police and firefighters have been 
injured. A firefighter sustained serious facial burns from a Molotov 
cocktail and a handicapped woman was badly burnt when youths set 
fire to a bus.
</P>
<P>
A rioter lost a hand attempting to throw a tear-gas canister 
back at riot police.
</P>
<P>
A female South Korean reporter was kicked unconscious and 
Italian and Russian journalists were attacked while reporting on the 
violence.
</P>
<P>
- CURFEWS: Twenty-five out of 100 French departments have been 
given powers to impose curfews after the government declared a state 
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Curfews were declared Wednesday in 32 towns and cities, 
including Nice on the French Riviera, Amiens in the north, Rouen, Le 
Havre and Evreux in the northwest and the Loire Valley city of 
Orleans. They were joined by the eastern town of Belfort on 
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The measure was lifted in seven Riviera towns on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
No curfews have been imposed in Paris itself. The outer Parisian 
suburbs of Le Raincy and Savigny-sur-Orge on Tuesday invoked 
municipal curfews banning children under 16 from the streets late at 
night unless accompanied by adults.
</P>
<P>
- DAMAGE: More than 7,500 vehicles have been torched and dozens 
of buses, schools, gymnasiums, nurseries, libraries, shops and 
businesses destroyed in arson attacks.
</P>
<P>
- INSURANCE BILL: The two weeks of car-burnings and arson are 
already set to cost the insurance industry some 200 million euros 
(235 million dollars), according to the French insurers' 
federation.
</P>
<P>
Insurers have said the average payout for a car is 3,000 euros 
(3,500 dollars) although not all will qualify for compensation.
</P>
<P>
- ARRESTS: Police have made more than 2,200 arrests, the 
youngest aged 10. One third have been released without charge and 
courts have handed down jail terms to 260 adults. In addition, 348 
minors have been brought before children's tribunals, 73 of whom 
have been ordered detained.

PARIS, Nov 14
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French cabinet Monday approved a bill 
to extend emergency police powers for three months in response to 
the violence that has been raging in poor city suburbs.
   Here is a timeline of the unrest:
   
   Wednesday, October 19:
   Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy declares a "war without mercy" 
on violence in the suburbs.
   
   Tuesday, October 25:
   During a visit to the Paris suburb of Argenteuil, Sarkozy is 
pelted with stones and bottles and calls rebellious youths in such 
districts "rabble".
   
   Thursday, October 27:
   Two teenagers in the northeast suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois, Bouna 
Traore and Zyed Benna, scale the wall of an electrical relay station 
to hide from police. They are killed by electrocution. Youths there 
rampage, burning 23 vehicles, vandalising buildings and hurling 
stones and bottles at riot police.
   In what becomes a ritual, scores of cars are torched in 
succeeding nights, dozens of people arrested and many police 
officers injured.
   
   Friday, October 28:
   Four hundred youths clash with police in Clichy-sous-Bois, 
throwing stones, bottles and Molotov cocktails. Police fire rubber 
bullets.
   
   Saturday, October 29:
   Five hundred people hold a silent march through Clichy-sous-Bois 
in memory of the dead teenagers. The violence resumes at night.
   
   Sunday, October 30:
   Fresh clashes erupt, and a police teargas grenade explodes near 
a mosque, sparking anger among Clichy-sous-Bois's large Muslim 
community.
   
   Monday, October 31:
   Violence spreads from Clichy-sous-Bois to surrounding suburbs.
   
   Tuesday, November 1:
   Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin meets relatives of the dead 
teenagers. Riots and clashes erupt north and west of Paris. 
Altogether, 180 vehicles are torched and 34 people arrested.
   
   Wednesday, November 2:
   President Jacques Chirac calls for tempers to cool. Villepin and 
Sarkozy cancel overseas trips to deal with the spreading unrest. 
Trouble erupts in 22 suburban towns north, south, east and west of 
Paris. A handicapped woman suffers severe burns when youths set a 
bus on fire.
   
   Thursday, November 3:
   A criminal investigation is opened into the deaths of the two 
teenagers. Villepin vows the government "will not give in" to the 
violence. Riots resume at night, and for the first time spread to 
other areas around France. Seven cars are set alight in central 
Paris. In all, 517 vehicles are torched in and around the capital 
and another 78 people are arrested.
   
   Friday, November 4:
   Arson hit-and-run attacks occur in suburbs around Paris and 
other French cities. A total of 897 vehicles are torched and more 
than 250 people arrested. A 61-year-old man is knocked into a coma 
by a hooded youth.
   
   Saturday, November 5:
   Paris prosecutor general Yves Bot cites "organised actions, a 
strategy" in the violence. Rampages again take place in suburbs 
outside Paris and spread to more towns. More than 1,300 vehicles are 
torched, 349 people arrested. Police bring in helicopters.
   
   Sunday, November 6:
   The violence peaks. Police say 1,408 vehicles were destroyed and 
395 people arrested. Two officers sustain head wounds when shots are 
fired at them, and another 30 are injured in clashes.
   
   Monday, November 7:
   The 61-year-old man hurt Friday dies of his injuries. The union 
of French magistrates say they cannot cope with the flood of 
detainees. Villepin promises curfew powers for regional authorities 
and 1,500 extra police. The level of violence starts to fall.
   
   Tuesday, November 8:
   Chirac's cabinet declares a state of emergency on the basis of a 
1955 law drafted for Algeria's war for independence. The northern 
city of Amiens uses it to impose a night-time curfew for minors. Two 
Paris suburbs and the town of Orleans bring in separate municipal 
curfews for minors.
   
   Wednesday, November 9:
   Authorities report "a very significant drop" in the unrest. 
Curfews take effect in 32 French towns and cities under the 
emergency powers. Sarkozy says non-French nationals convicted over 
the riots will be deported. His ministry later says minors and other 
categories would be exempt.
   
   Thursday, November 10:
   Sarkozy stands by his much-criticised remarks that rioters are 
"louts and rabble." Eight policemen are suspended after the alleged 
beating of a young rioter.
   
   Friday, November 11:
   Remembrance Day ceremonies in central Paris draw a large police 
presence, but no trouble is reported. Authorities in the capital use 
their new powers to ban public meetings Saturday, citing Internet 
calls for youths to protest.
   
   Saturday, November 12:
   Paris is quiet, but in Lyon police use tear-gas to disperse 
stone-throwing youths, in the first clash in the heart of a major 
city. The interior ministry says first expulsions of convicted 
foreigners could start Monday.
   
   Sunday, November 13:
   Authorities in Lyon impose a ban on public meetings during the 
day. Police are confident things are returning to normal. Far-right 
leader Jean-Marie Le Pen says the riots are the result of massive 
immigration fom the Third World.

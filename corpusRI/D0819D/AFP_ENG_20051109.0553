<DATELINE>
PARIS, Nov 9
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emergency powers permitting the imposition 
of curfews were invoked in relatively few French towns Wednesday, 
after the previous night's violence lent hope that two weeks of 
rioting could be on the wane.
</P>
<P>
State governors declared curfews in 32 towns and cities, two 
thirds of them on the Mediterranean coast, to curtail unrest which 
had spread to some 300 areas across the country at its peak.
</P>
<P>
However, that was only a fraction of the local authorities who 
could have invoked their new powers, and only five of the 25 
regional departments allowed to do so have actually taken the step 
so far.
</P>
<P>
The French government on Tuesday invoked a 50-year-old law to 
declare a state of emergency in 25 riot-hit departments, leaving it 
to the discretion of state governors, or prefects, whether to enact 
curfews and other measures.
</P>
<P>
The first curfew imposed under the emergency powers went into 
effect Tuesday night in the northern city of Amiens.
</P>
<P>
On the same night though, the level of unrest across the country 
showed the first signs of abating with some 617 car-burnings 
compared to more than 1,100 the night before.
</P>
<P>
No curfew was imposed under the new powers anywhere in the Paris 
region, where the violence broke out on October 27.
</P>
<P>
In the southern department of Alpes-Maritimes, the authorities 
issued curfews for 21 cities and towns on the Mediterranean Riviera 
including Nice, Grasse, Antibes and Cannes.
</P>
<P>
The order bans unaccompanied children under 16 from leaving 
their homes between the hours of 10:00 pm and 5:00 am.
</P>
<P>
In addition 15 bars in Nice and Saint-Laurent-du-Var were told 
to close during the same hours.
</P>
<P>
Similar curfews have been issued for the Normandy towns of 
Rouen, Le Havre and Elbeuf, part of the town of Evreux, 100 
kilometres (60 miles) west of Paris.
</P>
<P>
In the Loire Valley south of Paris, a overnight curfew running 
from 9:00 pm to 6:00 am was declared in six towns, including the 
historic city of Orleans.
</P>
<P>
Orleans, along with the Paris suburbs of Savigny-sur-Orge and 
Raincy, had already issued similar orders under a separate 
administrative procedure.

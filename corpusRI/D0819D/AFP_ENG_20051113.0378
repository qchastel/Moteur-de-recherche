<P>
The French government was to meet Monday 
on whether to extend a state of emergency in a number of places to 
tackle more than two weeks of urban unrest as the number of attacks 
was dropping nationwide.
</P>
<P>
An overnight curfew was still in force in 40 municipalities and 
authorities in the southeastern city of Lyon banned public 
gatherings in order to head off a repeat of clashes in the historic 
centre. 
</P>
<P>
Police said no incident was reported in France's third-largest 
city Sunday afternoon but 15 cars were set ablaze during the day and 
three people who were carrying gasoline (petrol) were detained for 
questioning.
</P>
<P>
In the region around the southern city of Toulouse 12 vehicles 
were torched and 10 people detained while 12 cars were set ablaze in 
the Paris suburbs.
</P>
<P>
In the northeastern Alsace and Lorraine regions, nine cars were 
gutted by fire, compared to 13 the previous night.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the unrest 2,652 arrests have been made and 
375 people have been sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
The European Union pledged to release 50 million euros (58 
million dollars) for urban programmes to improve conditions in 
France's riot-hit areas, the EU executive president Jose Manuel 
Barroso said before a meeting with French Prime Minister Dominique 
de Villepin late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
National police chief Michel Gaudin said there was "a major 
easing-off.
</P>
<P>
"Things should begin to get rapidly back to normal," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to figures compiled before the riots by the police 
intelligence service RG, some 28,000 cars were burned in the first 
10 months of the year -- making an average of 650 a week, most of 
which were destroyed at weekends.
</P>
<P>
The centre of Paris remained calm after the authorities banned 
public meetings there on Saturday, fearing an influx of youth gangs 
from the suburbs. In the end there was no sign of trouble, and the 
capital's outskirts were also relatively quiet.
</P>
<P>
A government official also spoke of cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
"We were expecting a hot night, but it was not as busy as he 
feared. We feared problems in Paris but there were none. The 
slowdown is now established, and things should be easier to 
control," the senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The assembly bans in Paris and Lyon were imposed under emergency 
legislation activated by the government of President Jacques Chirac 
on Tuesday in response to the worst outbreak of urban violence in 
France since the student uprising of May 1968.
</P>
<P>
The same emergency law was used to impose overnight curfews in 
seven regions Saturday night, including Lyon, Nice on the Riviera 
and Rouen in Normandy. Under the orders all unaccompanied children 
under 16 are banned from leaving their homes after 10:00 pm (2100 
GMT).
</P>
<P>
The violence in France's delapidated out-of-town tenement 
estates was sparked by the accidental deaths of two teenagers who 
hid in an electricity sub-station in the Paris suburb of 
Clichy-sous-Bois after an encounter with police.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 cars have been burned since and numerous 
businesses and public buildings gutted by gangs of youths who are 
mainly from the country's Arab and black minorities.
</P>
<P>
Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen in an interview on the 
private radio station RTL1 on Sunday blamed the rioting on 
"uncontrolled immigration from the Third World" and, while endorsing 
the use of curfews, he described the government response as 
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen, 77, was to speak at a rally of France's National Front 
party in central Paris Monday evening.

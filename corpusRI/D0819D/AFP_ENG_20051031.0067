<P>
Three men were jailed 
Monday after police clashed with youths in a Paris suburb for a 
fourth straight night, as angry residents accused police of throwing 
a teargas grenade at a mosque.
</P>
<P>
In all, 27 people have been arrested since the violence first 
erupted late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Two 25-year-old men and another aged 27, detained on Friday 
during the worst of the rioting, were handed eight-month jail 
sentences including two months' firm imprisonment for throwing 
projectiles at police officers.
</P>
<P>
Five other adults were due to appear before the judge north of 
Paris later Monday, while three teenagers were to appear before a 
children's court judge.
</P>
<P>
The latest night of rioting in the northeastern suburb of 
Clichy-sous-Bois, left eight cars and 16 rubbish bins torched, 
adding to dozens of other vehicles that were incinerated in the 
preceding rampages.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of civilian casualties but six police 
officers were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
As with the previous nights of rioting, the violence dissipated 
before dawn and the suburb was calm during the day Monday.
</P>
<P>
The unrest was originally triggered when two teenagers, aged 15 
and 17, died by electrocution on Thursday after they scaled the wall 
of an electrical relay station and touched a transformer.
</P>
<P>
Molins said the boys thought they were being chased by police, 
but authorities have denied that was the case.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of the suburb's residents held a peaceful march 
Saturday in memory of the teenagers, with groups of youths wearing 
tee-shirts marked "Dead for Nothing".
</P>
<P>
A lawyer representing the families of the victims, Jean-Pierre 
Mignard, asked: "Why did these young people, who had done nothing 
wrong, feel sufficiently threatened to enter a dangerous site, climb 
over a 2.5-metre (six foot) barbed-wire covered wall and hide inside 
a turbine?"
</P>
<P>
The clashes have pitted youths -- at times several hundred of 
them -- against police, leaving a total of 23 officers injured.
</P>
<P>
Clichy-sous-Bois is a low-rent, high-immigration district with a 
large share of public housing and a history of social problems.
</P>
<P>
A police teargas grenade thrown into the local mosque -- near to 
which "100 to 150 youths were looking for a fight," according to 
departmental security spokesman Jean-Luc Sidot -- looked certain to 
worsen the running conflict.
</P>
<P>
Muslims inside the building accused police of firing the weapon 
into a place of worship.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy confirmed that the grenade was 
of the type used by riot squads, but said "that does not mean that 
it was fired by a police officer."
</P>
<P>
An inquiry was underway into the incident, he said, adding that 
he would speak with the mosque's imam, or prayer leader.
</P>
<P>
The families of the victims on Monday turned down an invitation 
to meet Sarkozy, and slammed the reported teargas incident as 
"disrespectful".
</P>
<P>
"We are asking for calm, we are asking for justice and we are 
asking for the riot police to leave," Siyakah Traore, brother of one 
of the victims, told a press conference at the mosque.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy did, however, meet five of the victims' friends, who 
agreed to call for an end to the violence.
</P>
<P>
Opposition and rights campaigners said the riots were fuelled by 
tough new French anti-crime policies espoused by Sarkozy, who vowed 
to wage a "war without mercy" on crime in the Paris suburbs just a 
week before the rampages.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy repeated on Monday that he was "totally determined" to 
combat the violence.
</P>
<P>
The main police union described the riots as "guerrilla" 
violence and urged politicians to avoid "putting fuel on the fire" 
by scoring points against each other over the clashes.

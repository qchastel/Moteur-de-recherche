Paris prosecutors opened an inquiry Tuesday into two young bloggers who urged
French youths to riot and revolt against the police, a judicial official
said.

<P>
The youths, a 16-year-old French teen and an 18-year-old with Ghanian
nationality, were detained Monday in the Paris region, the official
said.

<P>
They were to be placed under investigation, a step short of formal charges, for
inciting harm to people and property over the Internet, the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity because French law bars the disclosure of
information from ongoing investigations. The charge carries a risk of up to five
years in prison and a euro45,000 (US$52,800) fine.

<P>
The blog, called "hardcore," was run by the 18-year-old, and the younger teen
posted comments on it, the official said. A 14-year-old was also questioned
Monday in the southern city of Aix-en-Provence and was released.

<P>
In 12 days of unrest in France, bloggers have posted appeals for calm alongside
insults targeting police, threats of more violence and warnings that the unrest
will feed support for France's anti-immigration extreme right.
</P>
<P>
One of the blogs was called "sarkodead" _ a reference to law-and-order Interior
Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, who inflamed passions when he called troublemakers
"scum." Both "sarkodead" and "hardcore" were hosted by Skyblog, a branch of the
popular Skyrock radio station.
</P>
<P>
The blogs were taken off line this weekend, and the radio station cooperated
with police by giving information to track down people who incited violence,
judicial officials said.

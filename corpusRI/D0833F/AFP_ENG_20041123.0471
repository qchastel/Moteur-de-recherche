India will launch more missions to the moon if its maiden unmanned
spacecraft Chandrayaan-1, slated to be launched by 2008, is
successful in mapping the lunar surface, a top space official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If there are good prospects for minerals then we will go for one or
more robotic missions," said Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Indian
Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the country's premier space
agency.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the success of the first mission," said Nair, who was
in the northern city of Udaipur to attend a five-day global
conference on "Exploration and Utilization of the Moon."
</P>
<P>
Nair said the two planned missions would be launched before 2015.
</P>
<P>
India's 590 kilogram (1,298 pound) Chandrayaan-1, which will map the
lunar terrain for minerals and conduct scientific experiments, will
also carry an "impacter" module, Nair said.
</P>
<P>
The "impacter" weighing 20 kilograms will descend from the lunar
orbit and touch the moon's surface to examine the surface more
closely, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the impact it will kick up some dust which our master control
room will pick up through the mounted cameras and analyse. It is an
one-shot affair," Nair explained.
</P>
<P>
The European Space Agency and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's X-ray and laser equipment will ride piggyback on
India's Chandrayaan-1.
</P>
<P>
The ISRO chief called on the international community to draw a
roadmap for future space programmes.
</P>
<P>
"International cooperation and collaboration is needed rather than
competition, which exists today, to share space on an equitable
basis. All the five nations should join hands to minimise costs,"
Nair said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the European Space Agency, China, Japan and India
are all planning lunar missions during the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The conference being attended by more than 200 delegates from 16
countries will draft a declaration on Friday underlining future
cooperation in space programmes.

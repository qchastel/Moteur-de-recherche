<P>
The prime minister on Wednesday criticized developed countries for restricting
exports to India of "dual-use" technology _ items the United States says could
be converted from civilian to military use _ a news report said.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the restrictions have not impeded
India's scientific efforts, the Press Trust of India news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Singh claimed that India has an unblemished record of nuclear nonproliferation,
which deserves the recognition of developed countries, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Washington has restricted exports to India of dual-use technology
due to concerns over missile and nuclear weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"These denials were misplaced and anachronistic," PTI quoted Singh as telling
scientists from India's Space Research Organization, or ISRO, on the southern
island of Sriharikota.
</P>
<P>
"The denial (of technology) has not impeded India's scientific efforts. In fact,
they have spurred you to greater heights," Singh was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He announced that a sophisticated new propellant plant would be set up in
Sriharikota for India's next-generation space launch vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Sriharikota is 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Madras, the capital of Tamil
Nadu state.
</P>
<P>
The United States and other Western nations imposed economic sanctions on India
after its nuclear tests in 1998. Most have since been lifted.
</P>
<P>
ISRO's plans to develop its own engine for launching space vehicles were delayed
after India tested nuclear weapons in 1998, prompting the United States to
pressure Russia _ India's traditional ally _ not to transfer technology for such
engines.
</P>
<P>
India began its space program in 1972, and has developed launch rockets and sent
up its own satellites.
</P>
<P>
The space agency says it has mastered the rocket technology needed to launch
high-altitude satellites and send a man to the moon. India says it now has the
capability to put heavy satellites into orbit as far as 36,000 kilometers
(22,500 miles) from Earth.

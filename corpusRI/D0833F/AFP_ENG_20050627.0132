India's first unmanned spacecraft 
will carry three European payloads on its journey to the moon, 
scheduled for 2007, to be used in experiments on the lunar surface, 
the head of the country's space programme said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Space Research Organisation signed a memorandum of 
understanding with the European Space Agency Monday to carry the 
additional payloads aboard India's Chandrayan-1 spacecraft, ISRO 
chairman G. Madhavan Nair told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The payloads will include instruments such as an X-ray detector, 
a particle detector and a multi-spectral imager.
</P>
<P>
ISRO is also in talks with the US National Aeronautics Space 
Administration (NASA) to carry a miniature imaging instrument to 
detect water ice in cold traps on the lunar poles up to a depth of a 
few metres (yards), Nair said.

<P>
"We have the capabilities to develop and manage a mission that 
would orbit the moon and enable a series of observations and 
measurements using specific instruments," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 590-kilogram (1,298-pound) Chandrayan-1 is expected to map 
the lunar terrain for minerals and conduct scientific experiments.
</P>
<P>
India has developed a tracking network to monitor the spacecraft 
while it is in orbit.
</P>
<P>
A special ground station is also being constructed near the 
southern city of Bangalore where ISRO is headquartered.

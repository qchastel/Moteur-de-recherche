India's space agency said Friday that a subsidiary of Boeing Co. has canceled an
agreement to help produce communication satellites.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Space Research Organization, or ISRO, said Boeing Satellite Systems
pulled out after deciding to withdraw from the business of producing light
satellites for which the agreement had been signed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are now looking for a different partner but that's going to take some time,"
G. Madhavan Nair, ISRO chairman said at the agency's headquarters in southern
Bangalore city.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, in a bid to step up high technology cooperation with India,
had granted an export license for a Boeing proposal to jointly produce and
market the satellites with ISRO _ India's equivalent of NASA _ in June
2004.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Boeing Satellite was to provide transponders and other
instruments to ISRO to help design newer versions of India's INSAT communication
satellites. The partners had hoped to start selling them to other countries in
2006.
</P>
<P>
An INSAT satellite typically weighs about 2,000 kilograms (4,400 pounds) and
hovers nearly 36,000 kilometers (22,500 miles) above the Earth. It provides
telephone communications, Internet access and television broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
"It is this class of satellites that Boeing decided to exit," Nair
said.
</P>
<P>
The deal had been reached even as ISRO and many of its subsidiaries remained
under the United States' export restriction list. American companies must obtain
an export license before selling high technology items.
</P>
<P>
Economic sanctions were imposed by the United States on India after its nuclear
tests in 1998, but most have been lifted. ISRO has also been removed from the
list.

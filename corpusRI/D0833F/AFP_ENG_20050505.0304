An Indian rocket blasted off 
Thursday, carrying with it the country's ambitions to be a major 
global space power and two satellites that it launched into orbit.
</P>
<P>
The liftoff in southeastern India was the first launch of a 
rocket with two satellites aboard and notched up another achievement 
in New Delhi's ambitious space programme, which hopes to send a 
probe to the moon by 2007 or 2008.
</P>
<P>
The launch "augments our launch capabilities considerably and 
reaffirms the emergence of India as a major space power," Prime 
Minister Manmohan Singh told parliament in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The 44-metre (147-foot) Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle carried a 
remote sensing satellite whose detailed imaging is aimed at putting 
every Indian household on the map and another for South Asian home 
radio operators that can be used during disasters such as 
earthquakes and floods.
</P>
<P>
The rocket lifted off from the Satish Dhawan space port, 100 
kilometres (60 miles) north of Madras, to loud cheers from 
scientists and their families who watched the rocket streak into a 
clear blue sky.
</P>
<P>
"It was a fantastically accurate flight and (satellite) 
injection," G. Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Bangalore-based Indian 
Space Research Organization (ISRO), told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The satellites were placed into orbit soon after lift-off.
</P>
<P>
President Abdul Kalam, a scientist dubbed India's "missile man" 
for his contribution to the country's satellite programmes, guided 
and ballistic missiles projects and nuclear weapons drive, watched 
the launch.
</P>
<P>
"We are all proud of you," Kalam told scientists.
</P>
<P>
Singh later sent a message to scientists at the space centre 
that "you are preparing India to take to the 21st century in terms 
of advancements in science and technology".
</P>
<P>
It was the heaviest payload ever carried by the Polar Satellite 
Launch Vehicle, a version of which is planned for use by India's 
debut moon mission.
</P>
<P>
On the launch's eve, space scientists placed tiny replicas of 
the rocket and the two satellites at a Hindu shrine and prayed for 
the mission's success.
</P>
<P>
The biggest satellite, the 1.5-ton CARTOSAT-1, will supply 
high-resolution pictures for more precise maps for planning towns, 
laying new roads, digging canals, disaster assessment and water 
resources management.
</P>
<P>
Among CARTOSAT's special features are two cameras that will 
provide stereo pictures to generate three-dimensional maps. Until 
now, Indian mapmakers have relied on combining satellite data to 
create three dimensional maps.
</P>
<P>
The cameras are designed to read images smaller than a car by 
identifying features down to 2.5 metres (eight foot four inches) 
wide.
</P>
<P>
The smaller 42.5-kilogram (94-pound) HAMSAT communications 
satellite will provide ultra-high and very-high radio frequencies to 
broaden bandwidth that Indian home operators had been seeking for 
years.
</P>
<P>
India has grabbed headlines with its commitment to send a probe 
to the moon in two or three years time. But its space programme has 
mainly been aimed at harnessing high technology for its population 
of more than one billion, particularly its rural masses.
</P>
<P>
The CARTOSAT-1 is India's 11th remote-sensing satellite on top 
of several broadcast satellites. India's other remote sensing 
satellites supply information for use in irrigation, agriculture and 
disaster management.
</P>
<P>
India has the world's biggest civilian cluster of remote sensing 
satellites.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's blast-off was the second since September when India 
launched Edusat, a distance learning satellite to allow teachers to 
broadcast primary and secondary classes to remote regions via 
television.

The U.S. space agency NASA is in talks with its Indian counterpart on whether to
take part in New Delhi's first unmanned moon mission set for 2007, an official
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
NASA plans to put two sets of imaging equipment aboard India's spacecraft to
study the moon's surface, said G. Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Indian Space
Research Organization, or ISRO.
</P>
<P>
"The talks are on," he said. "It is an opportunity we are looking forward
to."
</P>
<P>
NASA plans to outfit the Indian craft with a radar device that can map the
moon's terrain, as well as a special camera able to take high-resolution
pictures, Nair said.
</P>
<P>
India's lunar mission, named Chandrayan-1, involves sending a 525-kilograms
(1,157-pound) satellite a polar orbit 62 miles (100 kilometers) above the moon's
surface. The orbiter is expected to last two years.
</P>
<P>
The mission is intended to develop a chemical map of the moon, with a
three-dimensional atlas of specific regions such as the polar zones, that have
high interest to scientists, Nair said.
</P>
<P>
At India's invitation, European countries including Bulgaria have decided to
place experimental equipment aboard the orbiter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ISRO plans to flight-test India's newly developed cryogenic rocket
engine later this year, Nair said.
</P>
<P>
Cryogenic engines work on the principle that more fuel can be stored in a
limited space if the fuel's temperature is at an extremely low temperature. That
would enable users to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles or place heavy
communication satellites into orbit 36,000 kilometers (22,370 miles) from
Earth.
</P>
<P>
Only a few countries _ including the United States, Russia and France _ have so
far been able to build cryogenic engines.
</P>
<P>
"Results from our ground tests have been good so far," Nair said. "We are now
developing the launch vehicle with a cryogenic engine."
</P>
<P>
ISRO's plans to develop its own cryogenic engine were delayed after it tested
nuclear weapons in 1998, prompting the United States to impose sanctions and to
pressure Russia, India's traditional ally, not transfer the technology for such
engines.

As thousands of animals remain stranded in hurricane-ravaged Louisiana, trapped
in homes or roaming evacuated streets, the head of the Humane Society complained
Friday that authorities have ignored pleas to set a policy for animal
rescues.

<P>
Many dogs, cats and other pets have been left to starve, said Wayne Pacelle,
president of the Humane Society of the United States. He proposed that emergency
responders be required to pick up animals they see if they are able to do so. At
best, they should sweep neighborhoods to collect pets, he said.
</P>
<P>
National guardsmen and other emergency workers are picking up animals on their
own, but Pacelle said the plans should be more coordinated and clearly outlined
by U.S. federal and state officials, a request he said was made and
ignored.

<P>
"We shouldn't leave it up to a matter of personal conviction on behalf of the
responders. It should be a matter of state and federal policy to have the
responders help with that effort," Pacelle said. "I'm afraid because it's been
so slow in happening, thousands of animals already have perished."
</P>
<P>
State and federal officials said pets have been rescued and, in many instances,
evacuated out with hurricane victims _ even if no specific pet policy has been
articulated.
</P>
<P>
Christopher White, a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration,
said of the 23,000 people evacuated through the New Orleans airport, "every one
of those people with an animal were allowed to bring that animal on board that
aircraft."
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 animals have been rescued and sheltered so far, and more than
600 reunited with their owners, according to Joel Goldman, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture's veterinarian in charge of Louisiana.

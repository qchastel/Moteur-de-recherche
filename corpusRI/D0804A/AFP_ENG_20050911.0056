NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana, Sept 11
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes when the 
helicopters and military vehicles go quiet in New Orleans, you can 
hear the howls and screams of the hordes of dogs and cats still 
trapped in homes and on rooftops.
</P>
<P>
"It's scary," said Willie Cirone, a volunteer from New Jersey 
who came to the stricken city to rescue animals after Hurricane 
Katrina. "There are hundreds of them in houses still."
</P>
<P>
About 20 volunteers tour the city in a convoy of trucks on the 
few passable roads. Some have small boats to go into the floods. 
Some of the volunteers have brought fishermen's gear so they can 
wade through the streets, carrying dog leashes in their hands.
</P>
<P>
They have come across terrified mongrels, a Pitbull that nearly 
strangled itself on a leash before collapsing with exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
"They are scared, they are hungry, they are tired," said Kerry 
Branon of the International Federation for Animal Welfare.
</P>
<P>
The address where an animal is found is noted, in case it can be 
reunited with the owner.
</P>
<P>
But most of the rescued animals are still waiting in a huge 
agricultural exhibition hall at Gonzales, about 80 kilometers (50 
miles) from New Orleans. There are already about 1,300 dogs, cats, 
rabbits, parrots and more.
</P>
<P>
"About 400 get here every evening. Only about 20 people a day 
find their pets here," said Laura Maloney, executive director of the 
Louisiana Society for the Protection of Animals (SPCA).
</P>
<P>
Exhausted human refugees tour the building. Some carry photos of 
their lost animals; some have put up signs offering a reward for 
their pets.
</P>
<P>
Summer Johannesson, a 23-year-old fashion student from Florida, 
and some friends came to volunteer at the shelter after the killer 
storm. She accompanied a distraught woman who had lost her cat and 
fell into tears every time she tried to describe it.
</P>
<P>
A sign warns everyone: "Please be cautious next to the cages of 
animals that are not yours. They are stressed and can be 
defensive."
</P>
<P>
Dori Mayard, a 42-year-old nurse, brought her dogs to the 
shelter. She managed to get them out of New Orleans before her house 
was flooded but cannot keep them in the two room apartment where she 
is now staying with nine relatives.
</P>
<P>
Some owners have got past the military checkpoints to re-enter 
the city to try to find their animals.
</P>
<P>
Others have not been so lucky.
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Whitlock tried to get back into New Orleans to find 
her 28-month-old cat, Carmine, but was turned back, brutally she 
thought.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday we were five blocks away from my place when we had to 
turn back. Only five blocks!" she said.
</P>
<P>
"We tried every side road. We were blocked by the sheriff. I 
begged, I pleaded, I would have offered them money, I even showed 
them the pictures, but there was no way.
</P>
<P>
"My neighborhood is perfectly dry, but they won't let anybody 
through. The sheriff told me 'You should have grabbed him when you 
had the chance'," she said, sobbing.
</P>
<P>
"They turned me away at gunpoint. They told me not today, not 
tomorrow, not for weeks."
</P>
<P>
Whitlock, manager of Faulkner House Books, which has the world's 
biggest collection of first edition books by William Faulkner, said 
she had left enough food for Carmine to survive about a week.
</P>
<P>
"But it's the water I'm concerned about. I didn't leave the 
toilet seat up because they warned us the sewers could overflow due 
to the storm. I bolted all the windows, I put special hurricane 
shutters on.
</P>
<P>
"He is my baby. He's bred like some dogs who are capable to bond 
with humans intensely."
</P>
<P>
Emergency officials say the pet toll could be as bad as the 
human one.

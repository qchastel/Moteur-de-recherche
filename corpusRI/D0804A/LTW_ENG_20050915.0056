<P>
Suffer the pooches, and the other abandoned
creatures of the storm.
</P>
<P>
They are lethargic. Or scared, if quivering is any measure. And the
really noisy ones are barking ferociously, like the brown
pit-bull-looking dog who fixes his gaze on a visitor and snarls so
intensely one can imagine him warning, ``Get me outta here, or else!''
</P>
<P>
Paula Atzenhoffer is examining them all, and holding a tissue to
her nose -- not from the overpowering stench of these hundreds upon
hundreds of pets, but because she's crying. She's come here to the
Lamar-Dixon Expo Center in search of her canine brood.
</P>
<P>
The last she saw of them was that awful Friday after Hurricane
Katrina. The police who came to rescue Atzenhoffer and her 13-year-old
grandson Charles from the streets of New Orleans made them leave their
beloved dogs behind: Scout the sheltie, Datsun the dachshund and the
dean of this canine crew, a Boston terrier named Pepe Le Pew. Three
pampered pets left to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Atzenhoffer carries a photo album to this emergency outdoor animal
shelter. It will help her identify her dogs and prove ownership,
should she find them as she walks from cage to cage amid the thick,
hot air stirred by hundreds of portable fans. Of the three,
Atzenhoffer's especially worried about Pepe.
</P>
<P>
``Pepe had surgery three months ago, kidney stones. And he has
seizures,'' she explains delicately, wiping her eyes. ``They're all
such sweethearts. We dress them up for Halloween.'' In one photo
they're each wearing a Santa hat. ``These dogs are like our
children.''
</P>
<P>
This reality is playing out for hundreds of other pet owners each
day at this Noah's ark of Katrina's aftermath, and on the streets of
New Orleans and other towns along the Gulf, where pets are part of the
ongoing evacuation even two weeks after the storm. And they are part
of the trauma many people surely still suffer. Who can forget the
little boy who cried so mightily that he threw up when rescuers
wrenched from his arms his dog named Snowball?
</P>
<P>
``People were staying because they wouldn't leave their animals,''
says Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United
States, which runs the Lamar-Dixon operation.
</P>
<P>
So, as rescue boats ply the rivery streets of New Orleans each day
to find humans, so too do pet rescue boats search for marooned pets.
Sometimes animals and their owners are found together. Sometimes the
animals are found alone and sick from drinking fetid, contaminated
street water.
</P>
<P>
They are brought here to Lamar-Dixon, in a small town between New
Orleans and Baton Rouge. At its busiest, in the days after the storm,
this facility held up to 2,000 dogs, cats, rabbits, birds and horses,
along with pet mice, rats, frogs and pythons, even a boa stored inside
a plastic bin wrapped with duct tape, lest the creature escape and eat
some of the hamsters and ferrets nearby. A similar facility, at
Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, is housing more than a
thousand pets. Rene Bafalis, spokeswoman for the national Humane
Society, says roughly 60 percent of New Orleans residents were pet
owners.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds more pets arrive at Lamar-Dixon each day, while similar
numbers are dispatched to smaller shelters for longer-term care. The
numbers have been so overwhelming that the Humane Society is trying to
keep it to 1,300, to better offer proper interim care of ailments such
as canine dysentery, infections, cuts, malnutrition and dehydration.
The flood of pets is not expected to abate until the search-and-rescue
operation is complete.
</P>
<P>
Instead of Noah, there are some 450 workers here: vets and staffers
from the national and local Humane Society groups, as well as the U.S.
Public Health Service and FEMA, along with volunteer vets and ordinary
people. There have been about 200 reunions here since the center
opened two days after Katrina struck, Pacelle says.
</P>
<P>
Each day hundreds of people -- old, young, singles, families, of all
hues -- arrive with hope of good news. They register, write down
descriptions of their pets, whether they were wearing an
identification collar, perhaps even offer photos. Then they begin
their search, coursing up and down the lanes of small kennels and
large crates searching for their companions.
</P>
<P>
Bafalis described one measure of how badly these animals want to be
found. To gain entry to a house with a barking dog, rescuers pulled
out an air conditioning unit and a dog came flying out, jumping into
the arms of a rescuer.
</P>
<P>
Not all pet owners simply left their animals behind, she says. In
some cases, ``people had taken large bags of dog food and ripped them
open before they left.''
</P>
<P>
But it is looking hopeless for Atzenhoffer, of Slidell, La. She and
her grandson have walked from cage to cage for more than an hour,
finding no Pepe, Scout or Datsun. She's been to counseling for the
horrors she witnessed on the streets during the flood. She says
Charles, her grandson, probably needs some help, too.
</P>
<P>
The day Katrina struck, she gathered Charles with the dogs at the
hotel she manages. But flooding forced them out after three days. They
ended up on a street corner. ``Rats were running around,'' says
Atzenhoffer, tossing away the memory with a shake of her head.
</P>
<P>
And a very ill man died right in front of them -- a man whose name
they did not know but who had a dachshund named Rudy. When the man
died, Atzenhoffer decided to take care of his dog, too. But they had
to leave Rudy behind with their own dogs.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, as Atzenhoffer is speaking, Charles comes racing up, all
red in the face and shouting, ``Grandma! We found Pepe!''
</P>
<P>
They run to the end of the row, to a small kennel in a medical
ward. Now Atzenhoffer's crying flat-out. She kisses Pepe through the
cage, letting him lick her face.
</P>
<P>
``He's the old man. He's been with us a long time,'' says Peter
Allnet, Atzenhoffer's son, who's choked up, too. Charles is jockeying
for a look, too happy to cry, though the news is not all good.
</P>
<P>
``He's going to need to go right back to a veterinary hospital,
because he has some serious injuries,'' says Jodi Witte, a FEMA
veterinary technician.
</P>
<P>
There are deep lacerations around the little terrier's neck. Later
in the day, Atzenhoffer's private vet tells her that a large dog bit
Pepe and apparently swung him from side to side, causing deep toothy
gashes. And one of his eyes was scratched.
</P>
<P>
But Pepe Le Pew will live. And Datsun, Scout and Rudy (as well as
her daughter's missing dogs, Buddy and Brinkley) may yet be found,
Atzenhoffer hopes.
</P>
<P>
``Well, I'll just have to make another trip tomorrow till we find
everybody. They're not just animals. They're my babies,'' she says,
carrying Pepe toward the parking lot in a white towel, like swaddling
clothes.
</P>
<P>
Another family is arriving -- two adults, three small kids. They
look tense, stressed. Atzenhoffer holds up her prize, her Pepe, and
calls out to them: ``There's hope!''

Virginia inmates take in cats orphaned by Hurricane Katrina

<P>
A Virginia prison has become a refuge for about two dozen cats displaced by
Hurricane Katrina, a place where female inmates are happy to be able to soothe
away the felines' trauma and fear.
</P>
<P>
Four Pocahontas Correctional Unit inmates have been caring for the cats since
they made the cramped 20-hour truck ride last month from an overwhelmed
Mississippi shelter. The women see it as a chance to help not only the abandoned
pets, but also the hurricane relief effort and even themselves.
</P>
<P>
"They've had a long journey," said inmate Wendy Brickey, 45, her eyes brimming
with tears. "I get the chance to make it OK."
</P>
<P>
The prison's Pen Pals program, in which trusted inmates help socialize abandoned
cats until they're ready for adoption, had just five felines before Katrina
slammed into the Gulf Coast. The Humane Society of the United States estimates
as many as 50,000 animals may have been left behind in the New Orleans area
alone.
</P>
<P>
An animal shelter in Mississippi took Pen Pals cat coordinator Peggy Lynch up on
her offer to help rehabilitate some of the cats it had taken
in.
</P>
<P>
A feeling of serenity permeates the prison's shelter, a squat, maroon building
just outside the barbed-wire fence. Pictures of cats plaster the cinderblock
walls and cat-print curtains and pillows brighten the otherwise drab
room.
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the nicest shelter that they could ever land in, so far as the
amount of love and attention," Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
The animals arrived agitated and scared, many suffering from respiratory
illnesses due to the stress of a long truck ride in a plastic carrier and weeks
in a cramped shelter. The inmates started giving them food, medicine, love and _
of course _ names.
</P>
<P>
Their furry charges include Gumbo, VooDoo and the Ragin' Cajuns _ a sextet of
frisky black kittens. A cat dubbed Katrina became displaced when her owner
committed suicide in the hurricane's devastating aftermath.
</P>
<P>
When word of the hurricane reached the prison, about 20 miles (32 kilometers)
south of Richmond, Virginia, some inmates donated what little money they had to
the victims. There was not much else they could do _ until the cats
arrived.
</P>
<P>
"Had I been at home, I probably would have gone down and helped," inmate Tuesday
Kilgore, 35, said as she reclined in a chair next to her favorite cat, Skye.
"This gives me responsibility and gives me motivation to go out and live a
so-called normal life."
</P>
<P>
So far, nine of the Mississippi cats have been adopted, and Lynch hopes someday
they'll all go to good homes.
</P>
<P>
At least one other prison _ Dixon Correctional Institute in Jackson, Louisiana _
has taken in pets displaced by Katrina, according to the Humane Society. More
than 200 animals have taken shelter in a converted dairy barn at that
prison.

PET ISSUES: DOGS ARE PEOPLE, TOO
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the terrificpets.com discussion board came the 12-exclamation-point alarm: "OMG !!
I just heard on the NEWS there may be 50,000
animals LEFT BEHIND!!!!!!!!!!"
</P>

As reactions to the Katrina rescue efforts have been divided along
lines of class, race and political party, they have also
highlighted another schism: between dog haves and dog have-nots. Animal
owners around the country have responded with outpourings of sympathy,
hurt and outrage: How could rescue workers have barred pets
from helicopters and shelters?
</P>

"There's been a lot of talk about this at the dog
run," said Carol Vinzant, who brings her shepherd mix Jolly
to the dog run in Tompkins Square Park in New
York. "They're forcing these dog owners to abandon their dogs,
which in ordinary times is a crime itself. Hundreds, maybe
thousands, of people died because they did the right thing
and stayed with their dogs."

Jo Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, said the agency had already received
more than $5.25 million for rescue efforts, along with shipments
of food, blankets and other animal supplies.

Such animal generosity is nothing new. After the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks on the World Trade Center, the ASPCA's New York
branch received so many supplies that it had to stop
taking donations.
</P>
<P>
Last week, as teams of rescuers combed through New Orleans on
separate missions -- one group taking people without animals, the
other taking animals without people -- many residents were still
refusing to leave without their pets.
</P>
<P>
"When we all re-evaluate this event, it may make us rethink
the way we do human rescue," Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
For Elizabeth Finch, the owner of two dogs named Zorra and
Hans Blix, the sight of citizens forced to choose between
their pets and their safety was, like the disaster itself,
indicative of broader social rifts. "Not to equate people with
animals," she said, "but this fits into a bigger model
of discrimination."

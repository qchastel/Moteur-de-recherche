A SMALL DOG'S LONG JOURNEY HOME
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ALEDO, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cheryl Landry sobbed as she tied Napi to
a pole on the hospital's roof and repeatedly told her
little dog goodbye.
</P>
<P>
She wrote two cellphone numbers on a white hospital band and
secured it around the dog's neck.
</P>
<P>
"Napi Witland belongs to Cheryl Landry, RN," it read.
</P>
<P>
Then Landry boarded a boat with her husband and daughter and,
after four days of dealing with death and despair, sped
away from New Orleans' Lindy Boggs Medical Center -- and
her beloved 2-year-old pug.
</P>
<P>
Anesthesiologist James Riopelle, armed with a stash of morphine, had told
his co-workers at the hospital that he would stay behind
and take care of about 65 pets, including a couple
of guinea pigs, for as long as it was safe.
</P>
<P>
If it became necessary, he would euthanize the animals rather than
let them drown in the rising floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking that Napi was dead," Landry said. "I thought they
had euthanized her."
</P>
<P>
But then she got a phone call she thought would never
come: Napi was alive and well in the small town
of Aledo, Texas, 20 miles west of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, in a reunion that brought bystanders to tears, Napi
finally -- after three long weeks -- found her way
back into Landry's arms.
</P>
<P>
As the storm approached New Orleans on Aug. 28, Cheryl Landry
persuaded her usually storm-stubborn husband, Larry, to ride it out
at the hospital, where she worked as a nurse and
her daughter worked as a medical secretary.
</P>
<P>
Napi went too, joining dozens of other pets brought there by
the hospital staff and patients.
</P>
<P>
After Katrina struck -- and the power went out and the
water began to rise -- things went from bad to
horrific at Lindy Boggs. Over the next few days, the
hospital staff worked tirelessly in the sweltering heat to care
for patients, fanning them with cardboard boxes and rationing food,
water and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Many patients died. At one point, Larry Landry helped carry the
bodies through the dark building to a makeshift morgue on
the second floor.
</P>
<P>
"What we saw in the hospital was not normal," Cheryl Landry
said. "There was nothing that we could do to care
for these people. We did the best that we could
with what we had."
</P>
<P>
Several days later, a fleet of boats finally arrived to begin
evacuating patients and staff.
</P>
<P>
That's when Cheryl Landry said she was told she could not
take Napi.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to leave without my dog," she said. "The
hospital administrator came and said, 'You can't. You have to
leave her.' I couldn't fathom the idea of leaving her,
that was like my child."
</P>
<P>
Landry said she tried to sneak Napi out in a bag.
Her husband, feeling his wife's desperation, begged a hospital security
guard to try to save their dog. The guard said
he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, she (Cheryl) is just going hysterical," Larry Landry said.
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Landry took Napi up to the roof with the other
workers' pets, where a dog run had been created, tied
her down and sobbed.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, we had evacuated just about all of the
patients," she said. "I think we had about nine left,
and those patients weren't movable.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, everybody was so distraught. Family members were crying
inside, and I had to go. They were begging me
to hurry up. My daughter grabbed my hand and told
me to come on."
</P>
<P>
Landry said that boats carried them to a causeway under the
Interstate 10 bridge, where they waited with thousand of others.
</P>
<P>
"I get out of there in the crowd of people and
I see all of these people with their animals," she
said. "I felt so guilty."
</P>
<P>
From there, they boarded a school bus that carried them to
a shelter in Lafayette, La.
</P>
<P>
The next day, they rented a car and drove to Baltimore,
where Cheryl Landry's family lives.
</P>
<P>
Napi never left her thoughts.
</P>
<P>
"I cried from that point on," Landry said. "All I could
think about was the things she used to do --
you know, peep around the corner at me. Everywhere I
move, all I hear is her little feet clicking."
</P>
<P>
She didn't know that Tenet Healthcare Corporation, which owns Lindy Boggs
Medical Center, had arranged to have helicopters and boats evacuate
the workers' pets from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The animals were taken to Slidell, La., and then bused to
an airport in Hattiesburg, Miss.
</P>
<P>
There, four people from the Aledo Vet Clinic -- Kent Glenn,
Janine Theal, C.J. Bishop and Susan Hill -- set up
a triage center, where they treated the pets, which for
the most part were mostly just hungry and dehydrated. Only
one of the animals, a cat, had to be euthanized.
</P>
<P>
The team then loaded the animals and drove them to Texas,
arriving on Sept. 6. The pets were placed with foster
families until they could be reunited with their owners.
</P>
<P>
"It's a blessing to give these people back their pets," Theal
said. "For some, it's the one thing they have left."
</P>
<P>
Mary Lou Finsterwald, a second-grade teacher in Aledo and animal lover,
took Napi home and instantly fell in love.
</P>
<P>
"She is a wonderful dog," Finsterwald said.
</P>
<P>
The next day, Finsterwald called the numbers on the hospital band
around Napi's neck.
</P>
<P>
Landry was sitting on her sister's porch in Baltimore when the
phone rang.
</P>
<P>
"Mary Lou introduced herself and asked me if I had a
dog," Landry recalled. "I said, 'Yes,' and she said, "Well,
I have Napi.'
</P>
<P>
"I hollered!"
</P>
<P>
The Landrys said Finsterwald told her how Napi had been rescued
and assured them that she was fine.
</P>
<P>
"That was the greatest moment of our lives," Larry Landry said.
"She said, 'Do what you have to do, take your
time, she'll be ready when y'all are ready for her.'
"
</P>
<P>
Landry said that she and her husband began making arrangements to
drive to Texas to get Napi.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, after deciding they couldn't wait any longer, they loaded
up and "put the pedal to the metal," Cheryl Landry
said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, the couple walked into the Aledo Vet Clinic, where
they had agreed to meet Finsterwald. They cried and hugged
and pumped the hands of the staff who were instrumental
in bringing their family back together.
</P>
<P>
Then, Finsterwald walked in carrying their dog.
</P>
<P>
"Napi! Napi!" the Landrys cried, scooping up their pet as customers
in the waiting room began wiping away tears.
</P>
<P>
Napi, wearing a hot-pink collar, began crawling all over the Landrys
and quickly began making up for three weeks of lost
kisses.
</P>
<P>
"It's a definite miracle," Cheryl Landry said. " My thoughts were
that I would never see her again."
</P>
<P>
After Finsterwald gave them a scrapbook filled with photos of Napi
taken over the last few weeks and that now-tattered hospital
band, the couple got on the road with Napi and
pointed their car toward New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
They plan to try to return home to retrieve photos and
some valuables before heading back to Maryland to start a
new life.
</P>
<P>
"This is the grand finale right here," Larry Landry said. "Thank
you."

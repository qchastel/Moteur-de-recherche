A DOCTOR CARING FOR ALL CREATURES, WET AND SMALL
</HEADLINE>

Animals are her specialty. But even Dr. Susan Eddlestone was impressed
by how they came through the disaster.
</P>
<P>
"Animals are very tough, maybe tougher than people at times," said
Eddlestone, an assistant professor in small-animal medicine at the School
of Veterinary Medicine at Louisiana State University.
</P>
<P>
"We saw animals rescued after three weeks," she said, "of being
in houses and living on a bathroom counter with no
food and drinking toxic water come in with their tails
wagging, even though they were emaciated and had severe diarrhea
and sometimes worse health problems."
</P>
<P>
Eddlestone, 42, volunteered immediately when a call for help went out,
days after Hurricane Katrina. The temporary animal shelter at Lamar-Dixon
Expo Center in Gonzales, La., 60 miles from New Orleans,
was overwhelmed. Eddlestone helped organize an additional shelter, at the
university's Parker Coliseum in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 1,200 animals she cares for on a given
day settle in quickly. "We turn the lights out and
they all go to sleep," she said. "It's like day
care."
</P>
<P>
Life is hectic, too, at home in Baton Rouge, where Eddlestone
has taken in her parents as well as a sister
and her family and two dogs. "I am from Chalmette,
which is in St. Bernard Parish and took the brunt
of the storm," Eddlestone said. "My entire family lost their
homes in St. Bernard. My hometown was washed away forever."
</P>
<P>
Many animals at Parker Coliseum were dropped off by owners as
they evacuated. Large and sicker animals rescued from the street
went to Lamar-Dixon, where a colleague of Eddlestone's, Dr. Rustin
Moore, a professor of equine surgery, helped care for 350
rescued horses.
</P>
<P>
"Many were running loose," Moore said. "People who stayed behind took
care of the horses and helped us catch them. They
were very valuable. We went back twice to take them
food and generators. We also brought out about 300 dogs
and a few cats. A couple of iguanas. A goat."
</P>
<P>
The reunions have been heartening. Eddlestone said she was touched by
pet owners who wept and embraced shelter workers. She cannot
forget a woman who, though disoriented and sick, first made
sure her dog got into a shelter.
</P>
<P>
The latest arrivals, Eddlestone said, are pets whose owners stayed behind
with their animals until the water was drained from their
neighborhoods. It is no surprise, she said, that people who
lost everything refused to leave without their pets.
</P>
<P>
"It's like leaving a child behind," she said. "This is the
only piece of hope they have that there's a future
to go on."
</P>
<P>
"I am changed," she said, "in that I know what is
important in life: our loved ones, including our pets, and
nothing else."

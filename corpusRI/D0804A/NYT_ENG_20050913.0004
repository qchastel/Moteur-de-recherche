They cruise through flooded or muddy streets, scanning
porches, backyards and windows for hungry animals left stranded by
Hurricane Katrina.
</P>
<P>
"It's very sad ... it is overwhelming," said SPCA Los Angeles
spokeswoman Dawn Cotterell, via cell phone from Jefferson Parish, La.,
as she and a dozen members of her Disaster Animal
Response Team hunted for lost pets.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen dogs chained on porches, tied up in backyards,
starving. Many of them are pretty thin, you can see
their ribs. It breaks my heart."
</P>
<P>
The Samaritans from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, Los Angeles, are among many Southern California residents who
have raced against time to aid pets along the ravaged
Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
They have scouted waterlogged neighborhoods. Fed stray animals. Manned temporary shelters.
Found foster homes. And attempted to unite family pets with
owners scattered from Texas to the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers work from dawn till dusk, bedding down for the night
in tents and rented cars.
</P>
<P>
In the next few weeks, SPCA Los Angeles plans to airlift
300 homeless dogs from Hurricane Katrina from Houston to Los
Angeles for foster care or permanent homes.
</P>
<P>
Amanda St. John, founder of MuttShack.org, said her rescue group has
shipped more than 250 dog crates to Baton Rouge and
New Orleans and rescued 40 dogs a day from within
the devastated city.
</P>
<P>
The Lake View Terrace resident will fly to Louisiana today to
coordinate rescue operations for 40 volunteers to save the pooches.
</P>
<P>
"We're camping out, we have groups in RVs, we're sleeping in
cars. We're just trying to save the dogs and cats
and the tarantulas," said St. John, 49, who grew to
love animals on the savanna in her native Zululand in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I got an e-mail yesterday saying, 'My pot-bellied pig is in
my backyard, please rescue him.' If need be, I will
be wading in the water."
</P>
<P>
Hollywood celebs have even jumped into the act, with public pleas
for pet relief.
</P>
<P>
"I am haunted, worse than you will ever know," said Gretchen
Wyler, vice president of the Humane Society of the United
States, Hollywood, based in Encino, who recruited such celebrities as
Sean Aston and Bill Maher for TV spots. "Everyone in
America knows that these aren't something that wags its tail
-- they're members of people's families."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, state and federal officials permitted more than 3,000 dogs
at a full HSUS/SPCA temporary shelter in Gonzales, La., to
begin relocating to other states.
</P>
<P>
That means more room for the dozens of pets rescued daily
from New Orleans that need aid. The Humane Society, which
has a disaster team of 200 rescuers on the Gulf
Coast, is looking to open a second shelter near Gonzales
to cope with the overflow.
</P>
<P>
The HSUS and other groups have rescued nearly 4,000 animals from
Louisiana and Mississippi, with 200 reunited with their owners. Petfinder.com
is posting photos of the lost Katrina pets.
</P>
<P>
Before they are shipped to other shelters, each pet will be
photographed, microchipped and documented.
</P>
<P>
"This is a massive undertaking," said Wayne Pacelle, president and chief
executive officer of the Humane Society, in a statement. "People
who have lost everything are holding on to their last
hope that their pets will be saved."

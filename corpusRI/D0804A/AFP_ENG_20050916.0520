Time running out for pets abandoned in Hurricane Katrina: 
welfare group

BATON ROUGE, Louisiana, Sept 16

<P>
An animal welfare group 
warned Friday that time was running out for pets abandoned in the 
wake of Hurricane Katrina, estimating that tens of thousands of 
animals had already died.
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society appealed for Louisiana state authorities and 
federal officials to intervene to ensure that any animals abandoned 
as residents fled New Orleans more than two weeks ago are rounded up 
and sent to rescue centres.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Pacelle, the president and CEO of the US society, said 
that while some 5,000 animals had been rescued, "there are many more 
failures than successes."
</P>
<P>
"It is a critical situation now. These animals have an 
incredible will to live, tens of thousands of them are still out 
there alive, in homes, roaming the streets," he said, warning that 
time was running out.
</P>
<P>
"We have literally now just a few days left," he told 
journalists in the state capital, Baton Rouge. He said that while 
animal welfare workers had been working around the clock, they were 
up against an overwhelming challenge.
</P>
<P>
"We are not big enough to handle the magnitude of this crisis," 
he said, adding that the pace of recovery had already sealed the 
fate of many pets.
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that because it's been so slow in happening, 
thousands of animals have already perished." Asked for an estimated 
toll of the number of domestic animals who may have died, he said: 
"Certainly tens of thousands."
</P>
<P>
"We want a policy to say that local, state and federal 
responders should actively assist animal rescue," he said. "We need 
a swift and decisive declaration."
</P>
<P>
Pacelle said the group estimated that some 50,000 animals were 
abandoned in households when the hurricane struck and that thousands 
had inevitably died.
</P>
<P>
Major Ed Bush from the Louisiana National Guard, which rescued 
thousands of people and animals from the floodwaters that engulfed 
New Orleans after Katrina struck on August 29, said that he was 
unaware of any official policy on rescuing animals from the disaster 
zone.
</P>
<P>
"From day one, our priority has been saving lives and getting as 
many people out as fast as we possibly could. ... Our number-one 
priority has always been to save human life," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that troops were authorised to destroy dogs that were 
found to be interfering with human bodies left on the streets as 
floodwaters from Hurricane Katrina receded.

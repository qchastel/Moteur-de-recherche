ONLINE EFFORTS CONTINUE TO REUNITE LOTS PETS, EVACUEES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After watching Hurricane Katrina's devastation from their Port Arthur, Texas, home,
the Myers family made evacuation plans.
</P>
<P>
If ever they were forced to flee, the family would head
to Marshall, in East Texas, where relatives would be waiting,
Michael Myers said. The men would go early one weekend
and build a shelter for their dogs.
</P>
<P>
They ran out of time.
</P>
<P>
"We had a family meeting before Rita was a thunderstorm," Michael
Myers said. "We wanted to keep everyone together. But Rita
came so fast we weren't able to put that plan
into motion."
</P>
<P>
The Myerses were luckier than many others. They contacted kennel owner
and animal lover Don Praeger in Arlington, Texas, who agreed
to shelter their pets and those of other hurricane victims
for free.
</P>
<P>
But many hurricane evacuees are still waiting to be reunited with
their animals. Thousands are being steered to Petfinder.com, a Web
site updated daily with photographs of lost pets.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 8,000 animals have been rescued from storm-ravaged areas, said James
Bias, president of the Texas Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.
</P>
<P>
"We're still finding some animals alive," Bias said. "Unfortunately, we're also
finding many animals that have died."
</P>
<P>
The Louisiana staging area where many rescued animals have been kept
since Katrina struck is being shut down, and owners have
until Oct. 15 to claim their animals from that site
before they are put up for adoption, Bias said.
</P>
<P>
"That's not to say that you need to pick up the
animal, but you need to be connected to the animal,"
Bias said.
</P>
<P>
To help return pets to their owners, the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Humane Society
of the United States have established a fund to help
pay transportation and other costs, said Karen Medicus, ASPCA project
director based in Austin.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations will do "whatever it takes to get the
animal back to their owners," Medicus said.
</P>
<P>
Animals have been shipped from Louisiana to different parts of the
country and placed in animal shelters and foster homes until
their owners can make provisions for them. Listing lost pets
on Petfinder beyond Dec. 15 is unrealistic, some experts said.
</P>
<P>
"We've had a few really sad situations where people have had
to release their pets to us because they have nothing
left," said Angie Sprott, spokeswoman for the Humane Society of
North Texas in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
Michael Myers and his 16-year-old son are doing what they can
to repay Praeger's kindness. Each morning, they drive to Country
Acres Kennel to help with cleaning and other odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
"I needed that help. I couldn't afford to pay the money
that they would normally charge," Myers said. "I wanted to
give him something back to show him how appreciative I
was."
</P>
<P>
Myers said a neighbor told him his house in Port Arthur
is in pretty decent shape. He said he plans to
take his family back sometime this week.
</P>
<P>
Those seeking animals lost in the storm are being routed to
www.petfinder.com, an Internet clearing site containing pictures, descriptions and locations
of lost pets.
</P>
<P>
Other resources:
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society of the United States and the ASPCA will
reimburse approved shelters the cost of transporting animals to their
owners, up to $400.
</P>
<P>
For help grieving the death of a pet or for support
after being separated from a pet, call the ASPCA's Pet
Loss Hotline at (800) 946-4646, enter PIN 140-7211 and leave
a telephone number. A volunteer will return the page.

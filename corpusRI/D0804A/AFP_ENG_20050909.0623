Soldiers assigned to 
rescue survivors of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans are turning 
their attention to saving pets as the number of people being plucked 
to safety dwindles.

"Our focus so far is on people but ... there is a lot of focus 
and concerns of a lot of people who left their animals or became 
separated from them," said Lieutenant General Russel Honore, the 
commander of the Katrina rescue operation here.

<P>
"We've got the capacity, it seemed like the right thing to do," 
he told reporters in the Louisiana capital of Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
Animal rescue officials have been collecting scores of pets and 
other animals from the shattered city, while many survivors have 
told of their distress at having to leave beloved cats and dogs 
behind in the watery city when they fled.
</P>
<P>
The tens of thousands of troops that have secured the city are 
completing their operation to rescue stranded victims and are now 
focusing on evacuating remaining residents and receiving bodies, 
Honore said.

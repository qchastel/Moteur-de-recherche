Ex-Liberian President Charles Taylor behind bars at Sierra Leone war-crimes tribunal

FREETOWN, Sierra Leone
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Liberia's one-time warlord Charles Taylor was in the hands of Sierra Leone's
tribunal Thursday, where he is set to become the first-ever African head of
state tried on war crimes charges by an international court.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has been indicted by the U.N.-backed tribunal on 11 counts of crimes
against humanity stemming from his support for brutal rebels in Sierra Leone.
His arrival in handcuffs at the court Wednesday represented a watershed moment
for West Africa, a region long shaken by Taylor's warmaking.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a momentous occasion, an important day for international justice, the
international community, and above all the people of Sierra Leone," said Desmond
de Silva, chief prosecutor of the tribunal called the Special
Court.
</P>
<P>
"His presence in the custody of the Special Court sends out the clear message
that no matter how rich, powerful or feared people may be, the law is above
them," de Silva said.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian police captured the exiled ex-Liberian president late Tuesday as he
tried to leave Nigeria, where he has lived in the south since stepping down from
power during a 2003 rebel attack. He was caught trying to slip across the
northern Nigerian border with Cameroon with his son, an aide-de-camp and a local
guide, along with two 50-kilogram (110-pound) sacks filled with U.S. dollars and
euros, Nigerian police official Alhaji Mohammed Aminu Bello said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. peacekeepers ferried Taylor by helicopter to the court, where de Silva said
he was read his arrest warrant and would make his first court appearance by the
end of this week.
</P>
<P>
Taylor joined nine other defendants, also charged with crimes committed during
Sierra Leone's brutal 1989-2002 civil war. Taylor, a bombastic speechmaker
during his time in the bush and as Liberia's president, made no
comment.
</P>
<P>
The charges against Taylor stem from his support of the Revolutionary United
Front rebels that terrorized civilians in Sierra Leone for years, chopping off
the arms, legs, ears and lips of their victims.
</P>
<P>
On March 3, 2003, Taylor was indicted on 17 counts alleging war crimes, crimes
against humanity and other serious violations of international humanitarian law
for backing the rebels during the war. De Silva said that on March 16, 2006, the
judge of the Special Court approved an amended indictment of 11 counts, which he
said "will ensure a more focused trial."
</P>
<P>
The court began trials in 2004, but Taylor was their highest-profile defendant
and the first African head of state to face trial on war-crimes
charges.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian police said they found him in a vehicle with diplomatic plates. He was
wearing a safari suit and was in possession of sacksful of dollars and euros,
they said. His journey to the U.N. court then went through several African
countries, after Nigeria deported him to his native Liberia, which handed him
over for extradition to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had granted asylum to the fast-talking, U.S.-educated economist under a
2003 agreement that helped end Liberia's 14-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, Nigeria announced that Taylor had disappeared from his home in
exile and admitted that his whereabouts were unknown, just a day before Nigerian
President Oluesgun Obasanjo visited the United States to meet with President
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
Bush congratulated Obasanjo on the capture Wednesday, saying that "the fact that
Charles Taylor will be brought to justice in a court of law will help Liberia
and is a signal, Mr. President, of your deep desire for there to be peace in
your neighborhood."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had resisted calls from the United States, human rights organizations
and the war tribunal in Sierra Leone to arrest Taylor to ensure he would stand
trial. Taylor in 1985 had escaped from a U.S. jail in Boston.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has said Liberia wanted Taylor tried
in the Sierra Leone tribunal, rather than in Liberia, where it was feared his
presence could destabilize the country's as it attempts to rebuild after
installing the new leader in January.
</P>
<P>
Some 15,000 U.N. peacekeepers are in Liberia, and the last U.N. soldier of what
was once a 17,500-strong force in Sierra Leone left in December. Another
10,000-strong U.N. and French peace force remains in Ivory Coast, where many
former child soldiers that fought for Taylor are now believed embroiled in that
conflict.
</P>
<P>
While the Sierra Leone tribunal's charges refer only to the war there, Taylor
also has been accused of backing rebel fighters elsewhere in West Africa and of
harboring al-Qaida suicide bombers who attacked the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania in 1998, killing more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
"I think his capture and being put on trial does not only close a chapter but it
also sends a powerful message to the region that impunity will not be allowed to
stand and would-be warlords will pay a price," said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said at U.N. headquarters in New York.

A day after his evident escape, Nigerian
police arrested former Liberian warlord and president Charles G. Taylor
on Wednesday as he tried to cross into Cameroon, according
to Nigerian police officials.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's government plans to send him directly to Liberia, where government
officials have said they plan to send him immediately here,
to face a 17-count indictment on war crimes for his
role in the bloody, decade-long civil war in Sierra Leone.
</P>

"Mr. Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, was arrested this
morning at the Nigeria Cameroon border," said Haz Iwendi, a
spokesman for the National Police, in a telephone interview. "He
was arrested in company of a driver and a woman
and they have been taken into custody."
</P>
<P>
Alert border guards spotted Taylor, who was in a Land Rover
with diplomatic plates, early Wednesday morning in the border town
of Gamboru-Ngala, Iwendi said.
</P>
<P>
Tayor would be sent to Abuja later Wednesday and then transferred
to Liberia, Iwendi said, though he could not say how
soon Taylor would arrive in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was in Washington on Wednesday meeting President
Bush, said he felt "vindicated" after Taylor was arrested. He
said that his meeting with President Bush affords them the
opportunity to discuss Taylor, and he promised the case would
be "relentlessly and vigorously pursued to its logical conclusion."
</P>
<P>
The arrest was a dramatic turn in the already complicated saga
of the effort to bring Taylor, who ignited a series
of civil wars that killed 300,000 people and engulfed much
of West Africa during the 1990s, to justice.
</P>
<P>
Taylor fled Liberia in 2003 as a rebel insurgency tried to
remove him from power, taking refuge in Nigeria after Obasanjo
brokered a peace agreement. Taylor was already under indictment for
his role in Sierra Leone's civil war, but the Nigerian
government said it would turn Taylor over for prosecution only
if requested by an elected Liberian government.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's new president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, said in an interview with
The New York Times before her inauguration in January that
Taylor's fate was a relatively low priority, given the myriad
problems facing Liberia and the fragility of the peace there.
</P>
<P>
But under intense political pressure on a visit to the United
States earlier this month, including a threat by Congress to
withhold aid to Liberia if she did not act, she
asked Nigeria to hand Taylor over.
</P>
<P>
Kayode Fayemi, a Nigerian political analyst who has worked with Johnson
Sirleaf to secure peace in Liberia, said the United States
might have made matters worse for Liberia by pushing the
country to deal with Taylor before it was ready.
</P>
<P>
"She was actually literally harassed to do what she did," Fayemi
said. "This is now going to make the situation much
more complicated and so much worse."

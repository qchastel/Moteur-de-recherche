<P>
Al-Qaeda's network is actively 
seeking to destabilize West Africa, partly through its links with 
ex-Liberian president Charles Taylor, who has given sanctuary to its 
operatives, a UN-backed court said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Taylor faces a 17-count indictment by the Special Tribunal for 
Sierra Leone. He is accused of arming and training rebels in 
exchange for so-called blood diamonds.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Qaeda has been in West Africa. It continues to be in West 
Africa and Charles Taylor has been harboring members of Al-Qaeda," 
said David Crane, a prosecutor with the warcrimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Within a month of arriving in Sierra Leone in May 2002 "we ran 
smack dab in the middle of Al-Qaeda," said Crane.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has been harboring Al-Qaeda members, including those who 
participated in the 1998 US embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya, 
since the attack. "We also have activities as late as 6 April 2005," 
he said.
</P>
<P>
Crane specifically linked Taylor and Al-Qaeda to an attempt to 
overthrow the government of Guinea, whose president, Lansana Conte, 
was the victim of a January 19 assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Chief investigator Al White emphasized that the researchers have 
been "receiving credible, reliable information" on the 
destabilization plans "from sources and witnesses we've been dealing 
with for three years in the region."
</P>
<P>
The sources report that Taylor "is actively involved in trying 
to destabilize the region and there will be another threat and 
another attempt very, very soon," White said.
</P>
<P>
Until Taylor is brought to justice "he will be an immediate, 
clear and present danger to peace and security not only in Liberia 
but in the entire West African region," White added.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, the former president of Liberia, is charged with 
warcrimes and crimes against humanity by the Special Tribunal for 
Sierra Leone for his role in that neighboring country's 1991-2001 
civil war.

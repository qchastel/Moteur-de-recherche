Liberia's former president Charles 
Taylor, accused of war crimes for his role in Sierra Leone's civil 
war, is a "menace to west Africa," Guinea's territorial 
administration minister said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The investigators at the UN court have confirmed what Guinea 
has known and denounced for a long time," Kiridi Bangoura told AFP, 
stressing he was speaking for himself and not the government of 
President Lansana Conte, a longtime nemesis of Taylor's.
</P>
<P>
"The Liberian warlord is a real menace for peace in west 
Africa."
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who was offered asylum in Nigeria in August 2003 for 
stepping down and ending a seven-year civil war in Liberia, has been 
accused by prosecutors at the UN-backed war crimes court for Sierra 
Leone of complicity in a January assassination attempt on the ailing 
Conte.
</P>
<P>
"Our country has been forewarned and secured," added Bangoura. 
"We want only that justice be done and that the troublemakers be 
prevented from doing more harm."
</P>
<P>
Conte is known to have backed rebels who rose in 1999 to oust 
Taylor two years after he became president at the end of his own 
seven-year civil war, providing them with a rear base, training and 
military equipment according to human rights groups and regional 
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor David Crane has also alleged that Taylor is 
responsible for introducing the Al-Qaeda terror network to west 
Africa through important transactions in so-called blood diamonds 
mined during the complementary civil wars that raged in Sierra Leone 
and Liberia throughout the 1990s.

A Protected Friend of Terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush administration is touting the rule of law and democracy as
priorities in its effort to create stability and defeat terrorism. Yet
it remains curiously apathetic about the activities of one of the
world's most notorious indicted war criminals, a man who is also an
abettor of al-Qaida and Hezbollah. I am speaking of former Liberian
President Charles Taylor, who has not only escaped answering for his
crimes so far but who may be given an opportunity to repeat them if
the United States does not act.
</P>
<P>
It seems to matter little here that Taylor's efforts to escape
justice may well succeed because of U.S. inertia. Indicted on 17
counts of crimes against humanity, Taylor poses a clear and present
danger to West Africa and U.S. interests. Yet the State Department
continues to respond to congressional inquiries with bland assurances
that everything is fine and Taylor is no longer a problem. It's not
true.
</P>
<P>
Unless Taylor is turned over quickly to the U.N.-backed Special
Court for Sierra Leone to stand trial, he will never face punishment
for the crimes he committed in the region at the cost of tens of
thousands of dead and hundreds of thousands of lives destroyed. The
mandate of the court, largely funded by the United States, expires at
the end of the year. It was established to try those ``most
responsible'' for the atrocities in Sierra Leone. Taylor is at the top
of the list.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's were brutal, vicious crimes. For more than a decade he
presided over forces that murdered, raped and mutilated children; they
also abducted children to use them as cannon fodder. He created
``Small Boys Units'' made up of specially trained children who, while
high on amphetamines, were used to raze villages and murder civilians.
He trained and supplied the Revolutionary United Front in neighboring
Sierra Leone, whose signature atrocity was hacking off the arms, legs
and ears of civilians, many of them children.
</P>
<P>
Taylor also hosted diamond buyers from al-Qaida and Hezbollah for
several years, allowing the two designated terrorist groups to earn
and hide their wealth in an asset that is untraceable and easily
convertible to cash.
</P>
<P>
In August 2003, under siege militarily, Taylor fled to Nigeria
under an asylum deal backed by the Bush administration and Britain's
Tony Blair. The terms of the agreement with Nigerian President
Olusegun Obasanjo were that Taylor not be allowed to participate in
``active communications with anyone engaged in political, illegal or
governmental activities in Liberia.'' In return, Obasanjo would not be
criticized for harboring an indicted war criminal. Obasanjo promised
to turn Taylor over only if the new Liberian government requested it.
</P>
<P>
There is clear evidence -- gathered by the court, U.N. officials in
Liberia and European intelligence services -- that Taylor has made a
mockery of the asylum agreement, meddling in Liberia's electoral
process by phone, e-mail, fax and cash payments. The court has
revealed evidence that Taylor funded and planned an unsuccessful
January assassination attempt against Lansana Conte, the president of
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the Coalition for International Justice has
found that Taylor is spending some of the millions of dollars he
looted to pay for campaigns of several of Liberia's presidential
contenders. His financial empire, built on shell companies and
businesses stretching from Nigeria to Europe and the Caribbean, is
feeding resources to his longtime business associates and military
loyalists. He will have the protection of whoever wins the October
election. The new government will then make sure Taylor can return
home and never face the court. Once he outlasts the court's mandate,
he will have escaped prosecution and will continue to wreak havoc.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan last month told the Security
Council that Taylor's ``former military commanders and business
associates, as well as members of his political party, maintain
regular contact with him and are planning to undermine the peace
process'' in Liberia. David Crane, the court's chief prosecutor, said
that ``Taylor is still ruling the country from his house arrest.'' Yet
the Bush administration has offered no support for turning Taylor over
to the court. The State Department has, in several recent briefings,
equivocated on whether U.S. policy really supports such a move.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason may be Taylor's long association with U.S.
intelligence services. During much of the 1990s, Taylor was close to
Moammar Gaddafi, the main financier of Taylor's wars. Taylor regularly
reported on his meetings to U.S. intelligence agencies and was paid
for the information. While the use of informants is necessary,
protecting Taylor in the face of unspeakable atrocities just because
of that historical relationship should not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the administration's apathy, a bipartisan group of
legislators is taking the lead. Reps. Ed Royce, R-Calif., Sue W.
Kelly, R-N.Y., Frank R. Wolf, R-Va., Victor F. Snyder, D-Ark., and Tom
Lantos, D-Calif., are co-sponsoring a concurrent resolution calling
for Taylor's expeditious handover to the court.
</P>
<P>
The congressional action is helpful, but what is really needed is
the administration's active support for Taylor's immediate
extradition. The administration must acknowledge that Nigeria acted in
the best interests of the region by taking him and thank Obasanjo for
his help. Britain has already done this. But Obasanjo must have the
political cover of public U.S. support to hand Taylor over. If Taylor
escapes prosecution, West Africa will be endangered and U.S. moral
leadership severely diminished.

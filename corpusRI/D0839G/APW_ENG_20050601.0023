Wanted for war crimes, Liberia's ex-president hunkers down in Nigerian exile

<P>
Wanted on war-crimes charges, Liberia's former President Charles Taylor is
keeping out of sight as he nears a second year of exile in a jungle-encircled
African city.
</P>
<P>
His host country, Nigeria, is under increasing pressure to expel the one-time
warlord from his all-expenses-paid purgatory and hand him to a U.N.-backed
tribunal to be tried on accusations he meddled in another country's civil war _
Sierra Leone's. The United States said Tuesday that "the time has come for this
to happen."
</P>
<P>
Taylor's spokesman, Vaani Paasawe, denies allegations by the Sierra Leone-based
court that Taylor is plotting fresh turmoil in West Africa, where he has long
been accused of playing a central role in the region's mayhem.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-backed tribunal has increased calls in recent weeks for Taylor to be
immediately handed over for trial, accusing Taylor of violating his asylum
agreement by meddling in the affairs of Liberia and its neighbors. Prosecutors
accuse him of ties to al-Qaida.
</P>
<P>
The United States helped arrange Taylor's flight as rebels besieged his capital,
Monrovia, in August 2003. Then, the world applauded Nigeria for granting Taylor
asylum, saying that was the only way to bring peace to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Now, the United States is among those who say Taylor should be
extradited.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that justice will not be complete until Charles Taylor appears
before the court to answer the charges against him, and believe the time has
come for this to happen," said Rudolph Stewart, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy
in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Olusegun Obasanjo had not gone far enough by offering to
hand Taylor over to Liberia, rather than the court in Sierra Leone, if the
government that results from October elections requested it.
</P>
<P>
"We have asked them to expedite this timetable. We do believe that Taylor will
be transferred to the court," said Stewart in an e-mail to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taylor chorus has heightened its pitch in recent months as the
U.N.-backed court, based in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown, said it has
new evidence showing Taylor was behind a January attempt to assassinate Guinea
President Lansana Conte _ himself accused of backing the rebels that fought
against Taylor.
</P>
<P>
The war crimes court accuses Taylor of backing rebels notorious for hacking off
hands and arms in the 1991-2002 Sierra Leone civil war, allegations Taylor
denies.
</P>
<P>
After assassinating Conte, Taylor hoped to relocate to Guinea, where he is
already forming a new rebel group, the court says.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's government would be attacked next, and the war crimes court
"disrupted," according to an internal document, which says all this is scheduled
to take place by the time of Liberia's Oct. 11 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone for the first time last week called for Taylor to be handed to the
war crimes tribunal. Until then, it had kept quiet so as not to be seen as
trying to influence the court.
</P>
<P>
Taylor triggered Liberia's descent into violence when he launched an insurgency
from neighboring Ivory Coast in 1989 _ hastening a cycle of violence across West
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal under which Taylor left Liberia brought an end to 14 years of
conflict, in which an estimated 250,000 died. The country's fragile peace is now
monitored by 15,000 U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
Taylor vowed upon his departure to return to Liberia but Paasawe says a return
to power is the last thing on the former ruler's mind and denied all the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
"He has told me categorically, he does not want to be president," Paasawe said.
"He would like to return to Liberia, certainly _ as a former president. He has
finally realized that he has served his time."
</P>
<P>
Paasawe also said Taylor would break a long media blackout and hold a press
conference Aug. 11 _ two months to the day before elections in his
homeland.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Nigerian president, Femi Fani-Kayode, said media interviews
are not allowed under an unwritten asylum agreement with Taylor, and that Taylor
has not informed Nigerian authorities of the planned statement.
</P>
<P>
"He is being monitored very closely and we certainly won't tolerate a situation
where he operates outside the conditions. If necessary, extra steps will be
taken," said Fani-Kayode.
</P>
<P>
Taylor himself was unavailable to speak to The Associated Press during a recent
attempt to visit him in the verdant southeastern Nigeria town of Calabar. The
government has provided him with a cream-colored villa overlooking a winding
river and forest as far as the eye can see.
</P>
<P>
Armed Nigerian police guard his hillside road near the Cameroon border. Some 200
family members and wards are in Calabar with him.
</P>
<P>
Paasawe was unwilling to say if Taylor _ accused of surreptitiously slipping
from Nigeria to conspire against his many foes _ was even home.

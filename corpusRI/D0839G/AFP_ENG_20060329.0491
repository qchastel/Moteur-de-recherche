Former Liberian president and 
war crimes suspect Charles Taylor, captured in Nigeria, left Liberia 
for Sierra Leone aboard a United Nations helicopter on Wednesday 
afternoon, AFP correspondents at Monrovia airport said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations announced earlier on Wednesday that it was 
ready to arrest Taylor on his arrival in Liberia and transfer him to 
the Special Court in neighbouring Sierra Leone, which has indicted 
him for crimes against humanity committed during the 1991-2001 civil 
war there.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter left Monrovia airport at around 5:20 pm (1720 
GMT), less than an hour after Taylor had arrived there aboard a 
Nigerian presidential plane, in handcuffs and surrounded by scores 
of government and UN security officials.
</P>
<P>
According to several representatives of the Special Court for 
Sierra Leone, who had arrived in Monrovia on Wednesday, the UN 
helicopter was due to take Taylor to Sierra Leone's capital, 
Freetown, 350 kilomstres away.
</P>
<P>
"The helicopter is ... to take Taylor to Feetown," one of them 
told AFP on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Taylor had been flown to Liberia to Monrovia from Nigeria's 
northeastern town of Maiduguri, after he was captured early on 
Wednesday trying to flee the country following the Nigerian 
government's decision to extradite him.

The prospect of the exiled former 
Liberian leader Charles Taylor being quickly sent to face trial 
appeared to recede Monday, as his country said it did not want him 
back and his host Nigeria said it had received no formal request to 
detain him.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo had on Saturday raised the 
hopes of international prosecutors that Taylor might soon be brought 
to court, when his government said Liberia was free to take the war 
crimes suspect "into custody".
</P>
<P>
But Liberia's President Ellen Sirleaf Johnson said: "Taylor 
should rather go to Sierra Leone rather than coming to Liberia. Mr 
Taylor was not indicted by a Liberian court and therefore he is not 
needed by a Liberian court."
</P>
<P>
Following Nigeria's announcement, the chief prosecutor at Sierra 
Leone's UN-backed Special Court called for extra security around 
Taylor's mansion in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar, where 
he has lived since 2003.
</P>
<P>
"The watching world will wish to see Taylor held in Nigerian 
detention to avoid the possibility of him using his wealth and 
associates to slip away," prosecutor Desmond Da Silva said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
But Obasanjo's spokeswoman Remi Oyo told reporters: "We read of 
the request in the pages of newspapers, it hasn't arrived here."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the security measures surrounding Taylor, she said 
simply: "Taylor is not a prisoner here". She refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
In August 2003, Obasanjo invited Taylor to step down as 
president of Liberia and accept exile in Nigeria in order to allow a 
14-year-old civil war to come to and end and enable a UN-backed 
peace process to begin.
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, he has come under increasing pressure to 
send Taylor to Liberia's neighbour Sierra Leone, where he stands 
accused of sponsoring a bloody series of human rights abuses by a 
brutal rebel army.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials close to Taylor said he has remained in his 
luxury villa in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar.
</P>
<P>
Taylor is accused of masterminding a policy of murder, torture, 
pillage and rape in the 1990s in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra 
Leone, where prosecutors have lodged a 17-count indictment alleging 
crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
In August 2003, in a bid to bring an end to a brutal civil war, 
Obasanjo invited him to step down as president, leave his besieged 
capital Monrovia and accept political asylum in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigerian leader has since come under pressure, notably 
from the United States, to send Taylor home. Liberia would in turn 
be expected to hand over its former strongman to the special court 
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo is due to meet US President Beorge W. Bush on Wednesday 
in Washington. White House spokesman Scott McLellan said that one of 
the items on the agenda will be "the need to bring Charles Taylor to 
justice."

LIBERIA'S EX-PRESIDENT LOSES ASYLUM AND DISAPPEARS

<DATELINE>
FREETOWN, Sierra Leone
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former president of Liberia, Charles G.
Taylor, vanished Monday night, two days after the Nigerian government
said it would end his asylum and allow him to
face indictment by an international court here.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, the warlord-turned-president who unleashed a series of civil wars that
engulfed much of West Africa in the 1990s, killing more
than 300,000 people, disappeared from the seaside villa where he
had been living in exile, according to a statement released
Tuesday by Nigeria's government.
</P>
<P>
His sudden disappearance was a huge setback for the court, which
is trying those suspected of atrocities in Sierra Leone's decade-long
civil war, and a major embarrassment for the Nigerian president,
Olusegun Obasanjo, just as he left for the United States
to meet with President Bush. It was unclear late Tuesday
whether Taylor fled to escape prosecution or was abducted.
</P>
<P>
"Taylor's disappearance is a disgrace," said Corinne Dufka, head of the
West Africa office of Human Rights Watch. "Not only for
the victims for the brutal war in Sierra Leone, but
also for efforts to establish the rule of law in
West Africa."
</P>
<P>
Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said Tuesday that Taylor's disappearance
would not relieve Nigeria of its responsibility to turn him
over to the special court in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
K. A. Paul, an evangelical Christian leader who has acted as
a spiritual adviser and spokesman for Taylor, said Tuesday that
he had spoken to one of Taylor's aides and had
been assured that Taylor was in hiding somewhere in West
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Backed by Libya and other regional powers, Taylor incited a civil
war in Liberia in 1989, which quickly spread to neighboring
Sierra Leone. He is accused of trading guns and diamonds
with the rebels seeking to topple Sierra Leone's government, backing
a rebel force made up partly of child soldiers abducted
from their homes and plying them with drugs to make
them ruthless killers. These child soldiers, and the rebel practice
of chopping off arms and legs of civilians, made Sierra
Leone's war one of the most brutal African conflicts in
a generation.

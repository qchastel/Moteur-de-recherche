AS STEWART ENTERS PRISON, HER COMPANY REFURBISHES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Martha Stewart arrives at the red-brick federal prison in
Alderson, W.Va., on Friday to begin a five-month sentence, the
company she founded is focused both on life without her and on life
once she returns.
</P>
<P>
The company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, has already announced
plans for a new television series that will start in January and will
not include Stewart. It has also purchased a magazine, Body &amp;
Soul, and a newsletter, Dr. Andrew Weil's Self-Healing, which share
similar health-related themes. Neither publication includes Stewart's
image or name, unlike the other products and publications the company
distributes.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Stewart is hardly relegated to the back burner. The
company announced last month that she will be featured in a
prime-time reality show produced by Mark Burnett, creator of
"Survivor." And she has signed a new contract that will pay her at
least $900,000 a year, once her prison term is complete, and gives
her the titles of founder, chief editorial director and media
director. She is also entitled to a car and driver and a $100,000
"nonaccountable expense allowance," the agreement states.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the company called itself "grateful for the closure
that Martha's decision to serve provides the company," adding that
"We will miss her, and eagerly look forward to her return and to
welcoming her back in March 2005." In the meantime, the statement
said, "Martha's standards of high quality and excellence will
continue to guide everything we do."
</P>
<P>
Her role continues to be a complex one within the company, where
employees look to her for guidance but saw their fortunes fade as her
legal problems intensified in the last two years. She was convicted
in March of lying to government investigators about the reasons for
her sale of nearly 4,000 shares of ImClone Systems, a biotechnology
company then run by her friend Samuel D. Waksal.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first step in rebuilding her image," said Allen Adamson,
managing director at Landor Associates in Manhattan. "She'll get more
sympathy for being in West Virginia than she could get with all her
high-priced lawyers."
</P>
<P>
He added, "While the company can talk about planning for life without
her, the best thing for the company is to get her back, get this
done, and let her move beyond it."
</P>
<P>
Before and after the trial, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia suffered
as television stations dropped her show, advertisers fled the bad
publicity and circulation of the magazine fell. The company's share
price has recovered to some extent, closing at $16.59 on Thursday
compared with about $19 a share in June 2002, but the company has
warned of losses through the end of the year. In the second quarter,
the most recent results available, the company lost 39 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who was sentenced to five months of home confinement after
her prison term, announced last month that she would begin serving
her sentence without waiting for the outcome of an appeal she plans
to file in the next few weeks. "She's very stoic," her main appeal
lawyer, Walter Dellinger, said. "Losing all one's freedom and privacy
for months is not an easy matter."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Dellinger sent a letter to the U.S. attorney and the
judge overseeing the case, demanding documents from the trial of
Larry F. Stewart, an ink specialist who testified for the government
and who was subsequently accused of perjury. Larry Stewart, who is
not related to Martha Stewart, was acquitted of the charges on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The letter states that "Ms. Stewart has not abandoned her appeal" and
notes that while some materials had been turned over, "they did not
include any of the pretrial materials requested." Laboratory files
that tested ink notations on a document listing Stewart's stock
holdings are among the materials sought by Stewart's lawyers. The
notation "60" was central to the trial, because Stewart and her
former stockbroker, Peter E. Bacanovic, both maintained that she sold
her ImClone stock because they had earlier agreed to do so if the
price fell below $60 a share.
</P>
<P>
Bacanovic, who was tried and convicted along with Stewart and
sentenced to a virtually identical punishment, has not announced
plans to begin serving his sentence. An adviser to Bacanovic said he
was considering doing so in order to get on with his life, but he is
also planning to file an appeal and is free pending the outcome of
that appeal.

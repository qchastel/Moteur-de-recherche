Questions and answers about the Martha Stewart case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martha Stewart, the American celebrity homemaker who had her own
cooking and home improvement TV show, reported to a federal prison in
Alderson, West Virginia, on Friday to serve a five-month sentence for
lying about a stock sale. Here are answers to some questions about
the case:
</P>
<P>
Q. Why is Martha Stewart doing time?
</P>
<P>
A. She was convicted in March of conspiring with her stockbroker to
lie to federal investigators about why she unloaded shares of ImClone
Systems stock in December 2001, just before the price plunged.
</P>
<P>
Q. What happens next in the case?
</P>
<P>
A. Stewart's lawyers hope to have the conviction overturned and must
file their brief with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by Oct.
20. The appeals court will probably hear the case in early 2005.
</P>
<P>
Q. What is her appeals argument?
</P>
<P>
A. Her lawyers have already outlined five main points they plan to
make on appeal. Among them are allegations that a juror lied on his
jury questionnaire and was biased against women, and that one of the
government's own witnesses, ink expert Larry Stewart, lied on the
stand. The lawyers also plan to argue that prosecutors improperly
suggested during the trial that Martha Stewart engaged in insider
trading, even though she was never charged with that crime.
</P>
<P>
Q. Stewart keeps saying she expects to be vindicated, but what are
her chances?
</P>
<P>
A. Legal observers say she faces an uphill battle. The trial judge
has already rejected motions for a new trial based on the alleged
lies by the juror and the ink expert. That judge has also written
that "overwhelming independent evidence" supports the convictions.
And a jury in Manhattan acquitted Larry Stewart of perjury charges
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Q. Can she meet with her lawyers while she is in prison?
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. At Alderson, lawyers can visit during regular visiting hours
_ 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, plus 8 a.m. to
3:30 p.m. on Mondays and holidays. Lawyers can also make arrangements
with the prison to visit outside those hours. There are no limits on
the number of visits lawyers can make.
</P>
<P>
Q. What will happen to the company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia?
</P>
<P>
A. Stewart, who resigned as CEO last year but has remained a guiding
force in the company, now leaves it in the hands of its management
team and board of directors. She has expressed "great confidence" in
them and urged advertisers to stand by the company. When Stewart
leaves prison and begins serving five months on house arrest, she
will be allowed to work a limited number of hours per week. And
reality TV show producer Mark Burnett has already signed on to
refashion Stewart's lifestyle show and create other television
projects around her once she's out of prison.

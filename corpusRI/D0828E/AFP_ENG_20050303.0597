<P>
US lifestyle guru Martha Stewart is 
expected to leave jail on Friday after a five-month sentence for a 
stock scandal that reinvigorated her career rather than dooming it.
</P>
<P>
Stewart's time in jail officially ends Sunday, but the federal 
prisons bureau can release prisoners on a Friday if their sentences 
end over the weekend, said US prisons spokeswoman Carla Wilson.
</P>
<P>
Supporters eagerly awaited her release from the Alderson minimum 
security prison in West Virginia, which inmates call "Camp Cupcake". 
A large media group was also outside the prison.
</P>
<P>
Stewart's reputation has made a massive public rebound during 
her time in Alderson, despite the conviction for lying about a dodgy 
stock sale.
</P>
<P>
She will still have to serve five months under confinement at 
her country estate in Bedford, New York. But Stewart has won a 
contract to host a spin-off of tycoon Donald Trump's successful 
television reality show "The Apprentice."
</P>
<P>
She will also star in a show focusing on the same subjects that 
she built into a multi-million dollar lifestyle empire -- cooking, 
entertaining, decorating and home renovating.
</P>
<P>
The businesswoman was convicted in March last year of lying to 
federal agents investigating her sale of nearly 4,000 shares in 
biotechnology company ImClone Systems. She began serving her 
sentence in October.
</P>
<P>
Newsweek noted her post-conviction fame in its cover this week 
headlined: "Martha's Last Laugh: After Prison, She's Thinner, 
Wealthier and Ready for Prime Time."
</P>
<P>
But the newsweekly is also in trouble for using the head of 
Stewart on the body of a model for the cover picture.
</P>
<P>
Shares of the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSO) empire, 
which she founded, were up 4.81 percent Thursday, trading at 33.58 
dollars in afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
According to Stewart's aides, the head of the empire is very 
optimistic about her future.
</P>
<P>
"This year, we usher in spring with an extra measure of 
gratitude, because the month of March not only marks the vernal 
equinox on the twentieth and the real start of our Northeast growing 
season, but also Martha's homecoming," Margaret Roach, editor in 
chief of Martha Stewart Living, wrote in the magazine's March 
edition.
</P>
<P>
Roach said Stewart will plant a garden in an old estate she has 
been renovating in Bedford.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you she is, indeed, ready to get planting, having 
ordered her seeds and made extensive to-do lists, just as she would 
have done in any winter," the editor wrote.
</P>
<P>
Roach also recounted some of Stewart's prison activities.
</P>
<P>
"The tales were always surprising," she said.
</P>
<P>
Stewart foraged for wild greens such as dandelion on prison 
property "to augment the limited fresh vegetable offerings in the 
diet there," helped decorate the chapel for a memorial service and 
made microwave meals "with whatever very basic ingredients the 
commissary had for sale."
</P>
<P>
She also launched a yoga class that she taught for 10 inmates, 
spent time crocheting and used old molds to create a nativity scene 
for her mother.
</P>
<P>
Roach even told how Stewart had carried out a yoga pose called 
"downward-facing dog" in the visitors' room at the prison "from 
which she seamlessly moved into a headstand."

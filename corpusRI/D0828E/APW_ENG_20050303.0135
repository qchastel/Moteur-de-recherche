Martha Stewart, who is about to get out of prison, seems to have undergone a
makeover on the cover of the latest Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
Stewart's face was placed on someone else's body for the cover story "Martha's
Last Laugh," making the 63-year-old look terrific after five months behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
Newsweek editors said there was nothing wrong with the "photo illustration,"
given that it's well known Stewart hasn't done any fashion spreads from prison
in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who knows the story and is familiar with Martha's current situation
would know this particular picture" was an illustration and not a photograph,
said assistant managing editor Lynn Staley.
</P>
<P>
Newsweek said it did not intend to fool readers in any way and regretted if the
photo illustration left any misimpression.

CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, THE CELEBRITY VERSION

<P>
Was the conviction of Martha Stewart for lying to federal investigators
worth the effort?
</P>
<P>
For her, "the last five months in Alderson, West Virginia, has
been life altering and life affirming," Stewart gushed in a
statement on her Web site on Friday. She added, "Someday,
I hope to have the chance to talk more about
all that has happened, the extraordinary people I have met
here and all that I have learned."
</P>
<P>
Prison, it seems, was a good thing. And that could present
a problem for criminal law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Punishing wrongdoing, the theory goes, has two primary goals: to penalize
the wrongdoer and to deter potential wrongdoers. But in Stewart's
case, it is not clear that either goal was achieved.
</P>
<P>
"It achieved everything the government wanted it not to achieve," said
Nina Marino, a defense lawyer in Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
"From the government's perspective, the objective of incarceration is to punish
someone, and I think that Martha Stewart has, ingeniously, instead
of being punished turned it to her advantage."
</P>
<P>
Of course, Stewart is a most unusual ex-con; few have her
public relations savvy or resources. "Stewart is very successful at
spin," said Austin Sarat, a professor of jurisprudence and political
science at Amherst College. "The prison episode right from the
beginning has been successfully spun."
</P>
<P>
Then, too, the negative impact of Stewart's conviction was mitigated by
the nature of the crime. She was never criminally charged
with insider trading, but rather with lying to investigators looking
into a stock sale in December 2001.
</P>
<P>
To many, that just does not seem terribly heinous.
</P>
<P>
"We use prison too much and often for the wrong things,"
Sarat said. "And like anything else we use too much,
and for the wrong things, it loses its currency."
</P>
<P>
Some rap musicians have for years burnished their street credibility through
weapons possession charges or worse.
</P>
<P>
But Stewart has used prison to soften her image -- to
make her, in the public eye, a more sympathetic person
than the perfectionist entertainer and executive she was seen to
be before her sentence.
</P>
<P>
Conceivably, her success could subtly undermine the deterrent effect of a
prison sentence, but that is neither here nor there, said
David Becker, a former general counsel at the Securities and
Exchange Commission who is now in private practice in Washington.
</P>
<P>
People go to prison and serve their time; once they have
done so, they're through, Becker said.
</P>
<P>
"The criminal justice system is not about cleansing one's soul," he
said.
</P>
<P>
So even if Stewart emerged from the Big House a hotter
commodity than when she went in, justice could still have
been served, Becker said. If nothing else, he suggested, Stewart
has probably learned not to lie to federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
"I have to believe that confronted with the same circumstances she
would act differently," he said.

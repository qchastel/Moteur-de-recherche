IF NOTHING ELSE, STEWART RESILIENT

<P>
For Martha Stewart, a felony conviction is not
such a good thing.
</P>
<P>
It's a great thing.
</P>
<P>
This weekend marks the end of Stewart's five-month prison sentence, a
term she chose to get over with by eschewing the
option of milking the appeals process. Stewart went to jail
with her head held high even as friends, advertisers and
investors deserted her seemingly sinking name-brand ship: She returns to
the outside world neither bowed nor broken, but ready to
reclaim her spot at the top of, well, almost everything.
</P>
<P>
In April's issue of Martha Stewart Living, Stewart's column will resume;
magazine readers were prepped for the return by editor Margaret
Roach, who wrote in March about Martha's indomitable spirit during
her incarceration.
</P>
<P>
Mark Burnett, impressed by Stewart's moxy, pitched two television shows: One
is an "Apprentice" spinoff; the other, a resumption and update
of her former daytime how-to program, "Martha Stewart Living Television."
</P>
<P>
Shares in Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. hit a
52-week high last week, though the company announced a record
loss of $60 million in 2004, nearly 10 times the
loss it suffered in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Stewart is reportedly in fighting shape, having lost 20 pounds in
prison while impressing the locals with her down-to-earth attitude. Fellow
inmates at "Camp Cupcake" (West Virginia's Alderson Federal Prison Camp),
have rallied to her side, shielding her from paparazzi while
she's scoured the grounds for fresh salad greens and taught
yoga.
</P>
<P>
There are still some challenges, of course, the largest of which
is five more months of incarceration, albeit at her 153-acre
estate in Bedford, N.Y. Stewart's movements will be monitored by
an ankle bracelet, she'll have regular appointments with a court
officer, and while she's allowed 48 hours of work time
each week outside the house, her movements must be accounted
for.
</P>
<P>
The specter of a civil suit (separate and different from the
criminal for which she went to prison) filed by the
SEC hovers, though it's been reported that negotiations are under
way for a settlement that would allow Stewart to reclaim
her CEO status in five years. (Stewart relinquished the title
amid the controversy, and law prohibits her from regaining control
of the company.)
</P>
<P>
She has a new boss in CEO Susan Lyne, who's used
to working for high-profile personalities (Rupert Murdoch, Michael Eisner) and
has been a calm voice of reasoned support during the
hoopla.
</P>
<P>
After her house-arrest term expires, Stewart will be on probation for
two more years.
</P>
<P>
Stewart won't be allowed to fraternize with other felons, meaning the
friends she made in prison are off limits.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Stewart is nothing if not resilient.

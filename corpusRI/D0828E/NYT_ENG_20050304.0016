MARTHA STEWART LEAVES FEDERAL PRISON
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martha Stewart, the billionaire entrepreneur who was convicted a year ago
of lying to federal investigators, left prison early Friday in
Alderson, W.Va., after serving a five-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
Her time at the federal minimum-security women's prison was behind her,
but her appeal of that sentence has yet to be
heard by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
She was released from prison about 12:30 a.m., according to a
statement at the prison, the road crowded with journalists and
fans. From there, she was expected to travel to the
Greenbrier Valley Airport, where she was to board a private
plane.
</P>
<P>
Stewart, 63, must still serve five months in home detention at
her estate in Bedford, N.Y., to complete her sentence for
lying about the timing of a 2001 sale of shares
in ImClone Systems.
</P>
<P>
Once the chairman and chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia,
she had to give up both titles after she was
indicted in 2003. Her company's stock, which represents the bulk
of her fortune, crumbled amid the scandal, and she had
to settle for the title of founder.
</P>
<P>
But the company's share price rose steadily during the five months
Stewart was in prison, closing on Thursday at $33.95, up
from a low of $8.25 in May.
</P>
<P>
Stewart will star in two television series and plans to resume
writing her monthly column for Martha Stewart Living magazine and
working at her office, one of the few places where
she can go other than her 153-acre estate. She must
wear a monitoring bracelet and cannot work away from home
for more than 48 hours a week. She will be
allowed, however, to be filmed at her estate.

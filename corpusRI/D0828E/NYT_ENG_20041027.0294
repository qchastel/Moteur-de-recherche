MISS MARTHA? SEND GREETING SANS GOODIES

<P>
America's favorite domestic convict may have literally become a
captive audience, but don't break out the glue stick and glitter for
a greeting.
</P>
<P>
While Martha Stewart may receive letters from fans and well-wishers
while serving her sentence at Federal Prison Camp Alderson in West
Virginia -- affectionately known as Camp Cupcake -- any crafts or
other homemade concoctions are strictly forbidden.
</P>
<P>
No holiday centerpieces. No cakes (especially ones with files baked
inside). Even homemade cards are iffy as glitter, ribbons, glue and
stickers are no-nos. Such cruelty.
</P>
<P>
Stewart herself addressed the restrictions in a letter posted on
marthatalks.com.
</P>
<P>
"I have been told that some of these letters have included gifts and
money. Please know that while these gestures of friendship and
support are deeply appreciated, any such items must be returned to
the sender by prison officials. Instead, if you are so inclined,
please make a donation to the American Cancer Society, a charitable
organization that means a lot to me," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
So how are her new digs?
</P>
<P>
"The camp is like an old-fashioned college campus -- without the
freedom, of course."
</P>
<P>
The better question: Who in their right mind is sending Martha
Stewart money?
</P>
<P>
Still want to send her a letter? Her address: Martha Stewart, No.
55170-054; FPC Alderson; Glen Ray Road, Box B; Alderson, WV 24910.

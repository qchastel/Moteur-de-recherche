FOR MARTHA STEWART, JAIL TIME IS A BOON TO HER BOTTOM LINE
</HEADLINE>

Since entering federal prison in October, Martha Stewart has tried her
hand at ceramics, learned to crochet and become an expert
on vending-machine snacks. She has also gotten a lot wealthier.
And when Stewart completes her sentence six weeks from now,
colleagues at her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, anticipate an
even bigger payoff.
</P>

When Stewart was convicted last March of lying to investigators, the
future looked grim for the lifestyle company she created. The
company's shares hit a low of $10.86 that day, slipping
even further the following week. Her flagship television show, Martha
Stewart Living, was placed on hiatus after losing many of
its CBS viewers. Scores of employees were laid off, and
merchandise sales, mainly through Kmart, declined. Revenue plunged to $127.2
million through last September compared with $175 million a year
earlier, and the company is expected to post a loss
for 2004.

What a difference a few months in prison can make. Since
Stewart's conviction, her company's share price has nearly tripled, increasing
her personal stake to an estimated $827 million from $318
million. Her March 6 release also creates a one-of-a-kind marketing
opportunity for her company, one that is not lost on
Mark Burnett, the "Survivor" producer who is planning a daily
live-audience program featuring Stewart for NBC this fall. "This country
is all about second chances," Burnett said. "That's what makes
it the greatest country in the world."

While they would not disclose specific figures, executives at Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia say licensing fees for the daytime show "are
trending significantly higher" than those for Stewart's original show, even
at its peak.

Doing time -- or what her friends call "the intermission" --
has breathed new life into the company's shares. Some investors
and analysts believe the shares are now over-priced and could
fall back to earth soon after the interest in Stewart's
post-prison status fades. The stock closed Wednesday at $28.31, down
2.1 percent from the previous day, after the company announced
plans to shutter its catalog and online divisions in February.
Still, the shares are way up from their lows of
about $8.50 just before her sentencing last July.

Whether American consumers view her as a more sympathetic person, or
are just curious what she'll be like after prison, doesn't
seem to matter to marketing experts, some of whom think
she will be able to take advantage of the renewed
interest either way. Her life inside the prison -- with
its predawn wakeup calls, unappealing food and suffering fellow inmates
-- has been sufficiently chronicled so that the 63-year-old Stewart
seems more a sympathetic character than a frosty prima donna
concerned only about her own agenda.

"If she gets behind prison reform, then she becomes Saint Martha,"
said Hayes Roth, a brand consultant with Landor Associates in
New York. "It would be great for the brand and
great for Martha. If she gets back to running the
basics of the business and has this added patina, if
you will, of having suffered and moved ahead in her
life -- well, Americans love that."

Martha Stewart has been exercising, reading and making friends in
prison, but the food at the minimum-security prison camp in West
Virginia is "terrible," the domestic diva's daughter said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure she could give them quite a few pointers, but I think that
the budget is so limited that ... I'm not sure how much change they'd
be willing to make," Alexis Stewart said on CNN's Larry King Live.

Stewart said she had played Scrabble with her mother during her
visits to the federal women's prison in Alderson, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
"She was having a lot of fun playing Scrabble until I started beating
her," she said. "Now she decided she doesn't want to play."

Alexis Stewart said her mother has one roommate in a dormitory-type
building that houses 80 women. The celebrity homemaker has not yet
been assigned a job, but in the meantime she has been taking walks,
going to the gym, watching television news and reading.

<P>
The prison allows her mother to have five books at a time, and she
subscribes to newspapers, Alexis Stewart said.

Alexis Stewart described reports that she was being groomed to take
over her mother's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, as "a
large exaggeration" but the idea that she might someday run the
company was within the realm of possibility.

Martha Stewart, 63, who was convicted of lying to investigators about
a stock sale, is serving a five-month sentence and is expected to be
released in March.

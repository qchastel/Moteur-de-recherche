The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said 
here Saturday it has pledged 800 million dollars for Indonesia in 
2005 on top of the support being provided for tsunami relief and 
rehabilitation in that country.
</P>
<P>
"Disbursements under these commitments will be additional to the 
significant special financial and operational support that ADB will 
be providing for rehabilitation and reconstruction work in the 
tsunami-affected areas," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The new aid to Indonesia will go to infrastructure, local 
government finance, water resources, agriculture productivity, 
education, and nutrition, vice-president Joseph Eichenberger was 
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite progress on the macroeconomic front, Indonesia still 
faces "several significant structural challenges," such as the need 
for massive investment and greater predictability and clarity in 
administration, the bank said in a statement from its headquarters 
in the Philippine capital.
</P>
<P>
The 800 million dollars will focus on medium-term economic needs 
such as improving governance and fighting corruption, 
decentralization, promoting human development, improved 
environmental management and "increasing long-term growth 
prospects."
</P>
<P>
The ADB has already allocated an initial 675 million dollars for 
the rehabilitation and reconstruction effort in Indonesia, the 
Maldives, and Sri Lanka which were all hit by the quake-spawned 
killer tsunamis in December.

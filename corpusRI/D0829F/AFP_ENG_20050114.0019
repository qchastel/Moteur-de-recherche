<P>
Australia's world number three Lleyton 
Hewitt has auctioned three of his tennis racquets to raise money for 
the Asian Tsunami Relief Appeal.
</P>
<P>
Almost 45,000 dollars (31,500 USD) has so far been raised with 
the help of the sponsor of the Sydney International tennis 
tournament to help the tsunami victims.
</P>
<P>
Over 21,000 dollars was raised in around five minutes' 
auctioning of Hewitt's racquet, donated by the player, after his 
second-round victory over Frenchman Arnaud Clement here on 
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A 7,000-dollar final bid by a spectator was matched two-for-one 
by the tournament sponsor Medibank Private.
</P>
<P>
Further bidding on Thursday raised a total of 20,000 dollars for 
Hewitt's second racquet and a third tennis racquet was to be 
auctioned Friday to further swell the fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
The December 26 tsunamis killed more than 163,000 people along 
Indian Ocean coastlines and left thousands more missing.
</P>
<P>
The money raised for the Tsunami Relief Appeal at the Sydney 
International will go to UNICEF and World Vision, organisers said.

The Hong Kong Special

million HK dollars (192,000 US dollars) for tsunami relief work in
India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, a government press release said 
here Monday.

The government has accepted the advice of the Disaster Relief 
Fund Advisory Committee and approved a grant of 500,000 HK dollars
(64,100 US dollars) to Cedar Fund to provide relief aid to tsunami
victims in India and another two grants each of 500,000 HK dollars
to the Association of Chinese Evangelical Ministry Ltd for its 
tsunami relief work in Sri Lanka and Indonesia.

The committee hopes the grants will help provide relief to 
tsunami victims in these countries. To ensure that the money will 
be used for the designated purposes, the committee will ask Cedar 
Fund and the Association of Chinese Evangelical Ministry Ltd to 
submit evaluation reports and audited accounts on the use of the 
grant after completion of the relief projects.

So far, the Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee has 
approved nine applications from five relief agencies to carry out 
relief work in tsunami-struck countries. The total amount of

The Disaster Relief Fund was established in December 1993 for 
emergency disaster relief in places outside Hong Kong. The 
Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for 
advising the government on the policy and practices regarding the 
disbursement of funds for disaster relief, advising on specific 
amounts to specific recipients, and monitoring the use of grants.

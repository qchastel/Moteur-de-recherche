<P>
An Australian telethon raised 15.2 million 
dollars (10.9 million US) in tsunami relief Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The telethon, broadcast simultaneously by all three of 
Australia's normally fiercely competitive commercial television 
stations, featured a concert involving some of the country's top pop 
stars.
</P>
<P>
The concert, titled "Australia Unites - Reach Out To Asia", was 
staged in front of an audience of several thousand at the Sydney 
Opera House, while television personalities hosted the telethon in 
Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
The donations come on top of more than 120 million already 
handed over by Australia and a one billion dollar aid package 
pledged by the government.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Australia's television networks have 
cooperated in such an appeal.
</P>
<P>
An all-star international cricket match featuring the best of 
Asia versus the rest of the world to be held in Melbourne on Monday 
is expected to raise another five million for tsunami relief.

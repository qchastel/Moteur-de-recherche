<P>
A Canadian couple on Monday stunned the 
Canadian Red Cross by handing over a donation of five million 
Canadian dollars (4.1 million US) for the tsunami relief effort in 
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Their offer will be worth 10 million dollars (8.2 million US) 
under the Canadian government's scheme to match all private 
donations to approved aid agencies in the wake of the December 26 
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The gift, by Kroum and Eva Pindoff, who made their fortune by 
founding the record retailer Music World, is the largest-ever gift 
to the Canadian Red Cross during a disaster appeal, the organisation 
said.
</P>
<P>
The couple pledged 100,000 Canadian dollars (82,000 dollars US) 
for tsunami relief on Friday, but after reflecting on the disaster, 
decided to do much more.
</P>
<P>
"After seeing more stark images of this tremendous tragedy and 
misery, my wife and I were up most of the night, grief-stricken," 
Kroum Pindoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to help alleviate the suffering, and decided we had 
to make a more substantial gift."

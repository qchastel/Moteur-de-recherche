<P>
The president of the central Asian state 
of Kyrgyzstan Tuesday put fellow citizens on guard against a 
pre-election "revolutionary virus," in an apparent reference to 
recent events in two other former Soviet republics, Ukraine and 
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
"There wont be any kind of revolution or upheaval of course, 
there are no reasons for that, but we should be ready to strongly 
resist various attempts to introduce discord and upheaval or to 
commit disorder," said Askar Akayev, who has been in power here 
since Kyrgyzstan became independent from Moscow in 1991 with the end 
of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Akayev was speaking ahead of Kyrgyz parliamentary elections on 
February 27 that will set the stage for presidential polls on 
October 30.
</P>
<P>
"Internal and external attempts of this type can ... at a time 
of large-scale political election campaigning, create additional 
opportunities for extremist forces to spread the pernicious viruses 
of discord and conflict," Akayev said on state television.
</P>
<P>
Like other leaders in the region Akayev has repeatedly voiced 
anxiety at recent popular opposition to the post-Soviet old guard in 
Georgia and Ukraine, where more western-oriented leaders have come 
to power.
</P>
<P>
The Kyrgyz polls are being closely watched because Akayev has 
vowed to stand down in October. 
</P>
<P>
If he does, it will be be a first for the region, as no 
president has so far ever stood down at elections in the former 
Soviet Central Asian republics of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, 
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Observers say Akayev is anxious that power should pass to 
persons who will not turn against the current first family, which 
has extensive business interests.
</P>
<P>
A son and daughter of Akayev are both standing in the elections 
to the 75-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
However Akayev has so far not cracked down on the foreign 
non-governmental organisations that some leaders in the region have 
blamed for Ukraine's and Georgias popular movements that voted down 
the old guard there.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the new leaders of Ukraine and Georgia denied that 
foreign interference sparked the "people power" movements in the 
ex-Soviet nations.
</P>
<P>
"We categorically deny that these democratic and peaceful 
revolutions were instigated artificially or through external 
influence," Ukraine's Viktor Yushchenko and Georgian President 
Mikhail Saakashvili said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Russia accused the United States of instigating the protests, 
which replaced Moscow-friendly regimes with pro-Western leaders.

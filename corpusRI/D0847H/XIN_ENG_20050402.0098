<P>
A delegation from the parliament 
of Kyrgyzstan will leave the capital Bishkek Saturday night for 
Moscow to negotiate with the country's ousted president Askar 
Akayev on his resignation, the parliamentary press office said 
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by Parliament Speaker Omurbek Tekebayev,
will negotiate with Akayev, now in Moscow, on details concerning 
his resignation, the office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Akayev, who fled the country amid strong opposition protests 
last week, has hinted that he wants to return and might resign if 
his security is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan's constitution requires the president to return to 
Kyrgyzstan and announce his resignation to all members of 
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the chairwomen of the Kyrgyz Constitutional
Court Cholpon Bayekova raised the possibility of Akayev's 
resigning abroad by saying that representatives of the parliament 
could go to Russia to collect and return with his resignation 
documents.
</P>
<P>
Akayev, Kyrgyz president for the past 14 years, fled his 
country on March 24 when opposition supporters stormed the main 
government building in Bishkek.
</P>
<P>
The opposition claimed Akayev rigged recent parliamentary polls
to pave the way for winning a further presidential term later this
year.

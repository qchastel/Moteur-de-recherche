<P>
Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev 
insisted that voting in crucial parliamentary elections in the 
former Soviet republic on Sunday was being conducted fairly, but a 
leading opposition figure cried foul.
</P>
<P>
"I believe these elections will be successful," Akayev said.
</P>
<P>
Voting equipment being used such as indelible ink for marking 
voters' fingers to ensure they vote only once and transparent ballot 
boxes "are all recognised as ensuring fair and honest elections," 
the Kyrgyz leader said after casting his vote in the capital 
Bishkek.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary elections, which are a stepping stone to 
presidential elections on October 30, have been surrounded by 
controversy, with protests in several parts of this mountainous 
country in the days leading up to the vote.
</P>
<P>
Akayev insisted Sunday that there would be no attempt to change 
the constitution to give him a new term in office, as opponents have 
suspected.
</P>
<P>
"I don't plan to introduce constitutional changes -- today we 
have the ideal and optimal constitution and balance of power," 
Akayev said.
</P>
<P>
But prominent opposition leader Roza Otunbayeva of the Ata-Jurt 
(Homeland) coalition said that "mass violations" had already 
occurred and called on Akayev to sack officials in his 
administration who she accused of orchestrating a 
signature-gathering campaign aimed at getting constitutional changes 
allowing Akayev to remain in office.
</P>
<P>
"Mass violations began already began this morning... the 
election race was untransparent, there were mass violations (and) 
huge use of administrative resources" to affect the outcome of the 
vote, Otunybayeva said.
</P>
<P>
"The country is in danger today -- they've closed down all the 
press, we are totally closed... it's the government which wants to 
destabilise the situation," Otunbayeva told journalists.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's elections were closely watched, partly because Akayev's 
promises to stand down could be a first for the Central Asian former 
Soviet republics, where no national leader has stood down in polls 
since the end of Soviet rule in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan, a mountainous country of around five million people, 
hosts Russian and US airforce units at separate bases, the latter 
used by Washington for operations in Afghanistan.

Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev Tuesday 
refused to resign and annul the results of a disputed parliamentary 
election, saying that talks were the only way out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that there is no basis and thus there cannot be 
any talk of an annullment of the parliamentary elections," Akayev 
was reported as saying by news agencies in a televised address to 
his central Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot put the legitimacy of newly-elected deputies in doubt 
just because someone wants it so," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There isn't and cannot be a resolution of the issue by force," 
he said. "All problems must be decided through a political route, by 
talks."
</P>
<P>
"As regards my resignation, the issue is outside the competence 
of meetings or political forces," he said. "Only the people can make 
such a decision."

<P>
Lawmakers gathered Tuesday to hear ousted President Askar Akayev's farewell
address and accept his resignation, almost two weeks after he fled Kyrgyzstan as
opposition-led protesters stormed his office and toppled his
government.
</P>
<P>
Akayev, currently in exile in Russia, signed his formal resignation at the
Kyrgyz Embassy in Moscow on Monday after talks with a parliamentary delegation
led by Speaker Omurbek Tekebayev.
</P>
<P>
The resignation, witnessed by a Kyrgyz notary, needed to be presented to the
75-member parliament on Tuesday to become effective. Lawmakers also planned to
watch an 18-minute taped message from Akayev.
</P>
<P>
The message was to be broadcast on state television later Tuesday to the rest of
this former Soviet republic of 5 million people.
</P>
<P>
Akayev had hoped to give his farewell address in person, but anger against the
longtime leader still runs high, and the new leadership warned that his return
could spark further unrest and put his life in danger.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyz officials had pushed hard to secure Akayev's resignation, seeing it as a
significant step toward restoring political order and giving a stamp of
legitimacy to the new leadership, which rose to power amid widespread looting
and chaos.
</P>
<P>
Akayev was ousted March 24 when a wave of protests that had seized southern
Kyrgyzstan spread north to the capital. Demonstrators stormed and ransacked the
presidential administration building, sending the president and his family
fleeing. Akayev resurfaced in Russia several days later.
</P>
<P>
Popular anger against what many saw as rigged parliamentary elections earlier
this year fueled the revolt, as did crushing poverty and widespread
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The interim authorities have scheduled a new presidential election for June 26,
but many feared its legitimacy would be undermined if Akayev clung to the
presidency _ even in forced exile. Before the revolt, Akayev's term was set to
expire after new elections in October.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan was the latest former Soviet country to be upended by popular
protests. Ukraine last year and Georgia in 2003 also saw mass protests that
ushered the opposition into power, and both dispatched envoys to Kyrgyzstan last
week to offer their help.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation, Akayev "listed the nation's achievements during
his 14 1/2-year presidency, but also apologized to people who bore grudges
against him," said Tekebayev's aide, Bermet Bukasheva. "He voiced hope that the
forthcoming presidential election will be democratic and fully
transparent."
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Akayev became leader of Kyrgyzstan in 1990, a year before it
became independent in the collapse of the Soviet Union. He was regarded as the
most reformist and liberal of the ex-Soviet Central Asian leaders, but his
increasing intolerance of dissent and his family's growing wealth turned public
opinion against him.

Hundreds of opposition activists rallied in the Kyrgyz capital Saturday to urge
President Askar Akayev to step down at the end of his term in October, amid
fears he might try and hold onto power.
</P>
<P>
Around 300 people organized by a coalition of civic groups gathered near
Bishkek's Victory Square, holding signs and placards. The activists passed a
resolution that called for the government to ensure that this year's
parliamentary and presidential elections meet democratic standards.
</P>
<P>
"The president must provide conditions for free and fair elections for all
candidates for president and pass his authority to a winner of the
(presidential) election," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of delegates to the Kyrgyzstan People's Assembly also
gathered in Bishkek Saturday to praise Akayev's achievements during his 15 years
in power.
</P>
<P>
The assembly is a government-orchestrated event meant to represent all regions
and ethnicities in Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
The delegates condemned the opposition and said Akayev was responsible for
bringing stability and economic growth in 2004.
</P>
<P>
"President Akayev has always cared about the people and the country's
well-being," Vyacheslav Krasiyenko, a high school principal, said at the
assembly.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections on Feb. 27, setting the
stage for a presidential vote in October.
</P>
<P>
Akayev, who has been in power since before the 1991 Soviet Union collapse, has
publicly pledged to hold the presidential election according to the
constitution, which restricts the president to two consecutive terms. Akayev is
officially serving his second term.
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, fear that Akayev's supporters will try to hold a referendum to
extend his term or that he will try to hand-pick a successor.
</P>
<P>
Akayev is one of the most liberal leaders in formerly Soviet Central Asia but he
has drawn increased criticism in recent years for alleged attempts to tighten
control.

Askar Akayev signed his resignation as Kyrgyzstan's president, lawmakers said,
11 days after he fled the country amid a popular uprising in which his offices
were stormed by protesters and parts of the Kyrgyz capital looted by
mobs.
</P>
<P>
The resignation _ to be effective Tuesday _ was signed at the Kyrgyz Embassy in
Moscow a day after Akayev met with a delegation representing Kyrgyzstan's
interim leadership, headed by parliament speaker Omurbek Tekebayev.
</P>
<P>
"Akayev has made an important decision," Kyrgyz lawmaker Tashkul Kereksizov said
Monday. "The people needed it very much."
</P>
<P>
Kereksizov said Akayev had recorded a statement to the nation, the tape of which
would be played to a session of the Kyrgyz parliament on Tuesday and then
broadcast on Kyrgyz television.
</P>
<P>
The resignation is likely to be a significant step toward restoring political
order to Kyrgyzstan, which plunged into uncertainty March 24 when an anti-Akayev
demonstration exploded into a clash outside the presidential administration.
Riot police guarding the building fled, and protesters rushed
inside.
</P>
<P>
Akayev surfaced in Russia several days later.
</P>
<P>
By stepping down, he removes the last major obstruction to holding new
presidential elections, which the interim government has tentatively scheduled
for June 26.
</P>
<P>
"The revolution has taken place, the new government is working, but this
document is necessary to bring the developments into the legal field,"
Kereksizov said. Parliament will formally endorse Akayev's resignation Tuesday,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan was the latest former Soviet country to be upended by popular
protests. Ukraine last year and Georgia in 2003 also saw popular uprisings force
out entrenched leaders and bring reformers to power.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation, Akayev "listed the nation's achievements during
his 14 1/2-year presidency, but also apologized to people who bore grudges
against him," said Tekebayev's aide, Bermet Bukasheva. "He voiced hope that the
forthcoming presidential election will be democratic and fully
transparent."
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Akayev became leader of Kyrgyzstan in 1990, a year before it
became independent in the collapse of the Soviet Union. He was regarded as the
most reformist and liberal of the ex-Soviet Central Asian leaders. During his
first years of his presidency, Kyrgyzstan acquired the image of an island of
democracy in a region noted for heavy-handed autocratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
Opponents complained that in recent years, however, that he showed authoritarian
leanings and that opposition activity was repressed.
</P>
<P>
The storming of the presidential administration building was the culmination of
weeks of protests by opposition supporters who accused Akayev of manipulating
parliamentary elections earlier this year to give him a compliant
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Akayev fled, deepening his country's political crisis, as the previous and newly
elected parliaments competed for legitimacy. There were two nights of looting
and gunfire in the capital, in which at least three people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The political chaos began to ebb last week after the previous parliament ceded
authority. Although the newly elected legislature has been seen as dominated by
Akayev supporters, it nominated Tekebayev, an Akayev opponent, as parliament
speaker.
</P>
<P>
Akayev had previously refused to recognize Kurmanbek Bakiyev, a former
opposition leader approved by both parliaments as interim president, saying he
considered Tekebayev the country's legitimate political leader.
</P>
<P>
But Kereksizov said Monday that Akayev recognized the new authorities.
</P>
<P>
"Akayev said that he wouldn't struggle against the new government, and that
amounted to his recognition of the new Kyrgyzstan authorities," Kereksizov said.
"He said he will not confront the new government in either words or deeds and
wished it success."
</P>
<P>
Prior to resigning, Akayev and members of the delegation on Sunday signed an
agreement reaffirming that he would enjoy security guarantees granted to former
leaders under the Kyrgyz law.
</P>
<P>
But Kereksizov said it was still too early for him to return.
</P>
<P>
"He will return some day to his native country, but he'd better stay in Russia
for now," he said.

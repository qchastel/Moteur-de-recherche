Kyrgyz Prime Minister Nikolai 
Tanayev vowed late on Sunday to seek negotiations to solve the 
dispute with the opposition over the country's recent 
parliamentary elections, said news from Kyrgyz capital Bishkek.

<P>
Tanayev said President Askar Akayev and himself were ready to 
have negotiations with the opposition at any time.

The prime minister said he had contacted the opposition leader 
in the current parliament and reaffirmed the government's stances,
hoping that the opposition enters the country's leadership through
legal procedures.

Thousands of opposition supporters, angered at what they say 
rigged elections, stormed government buildings in the southern 
Kyrgyz town of Jalal-Abad on Sunday, following protests Friday in 
nearby Osh.

At least four policemen were reported beaten to death Sunday in
clashes that broke out after police fired shots but failed to stop
the demonstrations.

Akayev's supporters won a landslide victory in the parliament 
elections held on Feb. 27 with runoffs in many regions on March 13.
The opposition refused to accept the results and accused the 
authorities of fraud in the election.

The opposition rallied, blocked roads and occupied several 
government buildings, demanding Akayev's resignation. Akayev has 
blamed the opposition leaders for inciting a civil war.
</P>

Akayev has served the maximum two terms allowed by the 
constitution and has pledged to step down before the presidential 
election scheduled for October.

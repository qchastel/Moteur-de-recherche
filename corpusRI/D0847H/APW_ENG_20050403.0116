A delegation of Kyrgyzstan officials arrived in Moscow on Sunday for talks with
ousted President Askar Akayev that they hope will lead to his formal
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Parliament speaker Omurbek Tekebayev, who heads the delegation, said Akayev had
given a verbal agreement that he would resign, 10 days after protesters stormed
the presidential administration building. Akayev fled to Russia after the
storming, leaving the country in control of an interim government.

<P>
A meeting with Akayev was to be held in the Kyrgyz Embassy, Tekebayev
said.
</P>
<P>
Akayev's resignation would likely be a significant step toward solidifying a
sense of political order in the country following last month's chaos. The
interim authorities have tentatively scheduled a new presidential election for
late June, but if Akayev were not to step down, the legitimacy of that election
could be called into question.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a truly historic mission," Tekebayev said on the flight from the
Kyrgyz capital Bishkek. "We hope to return tonight with his resignation."
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan's interim authorities have said the law providing immunity to Akayev
as president would be observed and that Akayev would not be persecuted if he
returned to the ex-Soviet Central Asian state.
</P>
<P>
However, Tekebayev suggested Sunday that a near-future return for Akayev would
be inappropriate because of anger among the populace against him. Many accuse
Akayev of corruption and obstruction of opposition political
groups.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of people do not support our actions; they want immediate
revenge," Tekebayev said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Akayev's resignation would ease conditions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We think that the voluntary handover of power will create a new political
situation in Kyrgyzstan. We want to create a new tradition for Kyrgyzstan, to
lay the basis for clean, honest elections," he said.

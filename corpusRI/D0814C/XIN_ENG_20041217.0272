<TEXT>
<P>
The African Union has reported 46 cases of ceasefire violations in
the troubled Darfur region of Sudan since the last peace talks ended
in Abuja, Nov. 24, 2004.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the AU Ceasefire Commission Festus Okonkwo disclosed this
here on Friday in a report to a meeting of the AU joint commission on
the Darfur crisis, blaming both the rebels and the Sudanese
government  for the violations.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that 28 violations were by the rebels, eight by the
government troops while ten were unidentified.
</P>
<P>
The report, which painted a bad humanitarian picture of the situation
in Darfur, urged both the rebels -- the Justice and Equality Movement
and the Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army -- and the Sudanese
government to stop the violations as they were impeding the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Okonwko said that most violations took place on the road, the banks
and the camps.
</P>
<P>
Most UN agencies have since ordered their workers out of troubled
Darfur as the violators had killed many workers and injured
thousands.
</P>
<P>
The AU-sponsored peace talks in Abuja are currently on halt as the
rebels who walked out on Tuesday had vowed never to resume the
negotiation process unless the government ends its attacks and
withdraws its troops from the troubled area.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission is between the AU and other partners like the
European Union, the United Nations and other interest groups.
</P>
<P>
At least thousands of people have been killed and one million others
displaced since the Darfur crisis started two years ago.

KHARTOUM, Oct. 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Prime Minister Tony
Blair stressed here Wednesday the importance to expand the monitoring
forces the African Union (AU) has deployed in Darfur in western
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Blair made the call at a press conference held at the end of his
several-hour visit to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Blair told reporters that the African monitoring forces must be
expanded by sending thousands of troops to ensure ceasefire agreement
and access of true information on the situation in Darfur.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would hold a meeting in Addis Abbaba, Ethiopia with
Nigerian president and current AU Chairman Olusegun Obasanjo to map
out an urgent plan to send more African troups to Darfur.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called on the Sudanese government to commit to the
humanitarian protocol it reached with the Darfur rebels in Nigerian
capital of Abuja in September and to help humanitarian aid reach
affected people of Darfur.
</P>
<P>
Khartoum must take serious steps to implement the United Nations
resolutions on Darfur and specify the areas for its army and the
militias in the region, said Blair.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has agreed to withdraw its military forces to
their barracks and to send police forces to take their places, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister denied that any of the European countries has
desire to send troops to Darfur, stressing the capability of the
African forces to control the situation in Darfur.
</P>
<P>
The international community will provide financial and logistic
support for the African forces in Darfur, he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair described his talks with Sudanese officials as constructive,
urging the conflicting sides in Darfur to fulfill their commitments
within a week or a month.
</P>
<P>
He, meanwhile, stressed the importance of reaching a comprehensive
peace in southern Sudan by the end of this year, saying the peace in
the south will be a key for solving the Darfur crisis because it will
provide a national government which is honest and balanced.

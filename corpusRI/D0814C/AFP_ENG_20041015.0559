Peace talks between Darfur's rebels and the Sudanese government,
which had been scheduled to restart in Nigeria next week, have been
moved to the Libyan capital Tripoli, the African Union's chairman
said Friday.

<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, who as the AU's current
chairman hosted a first round of talks in Abuja in August and
September, announced the switch at a briefing on the crisis for
western ambassadors, his office said.

<P>
"Talks on Darfur earlier slated for Abuja had to be switched to
Tripoli to secure the attendance of neighbouring countries whose
cooperation was crucial to lasting peace," it said in a statement,
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Although the text did not say when the talks were due to restart, an
official in the Nigerian president's office told AFP that they will
resume in Tripoli on October 21.
</P>
<P>
The previous round in Abuja was suspended for one month on September
18.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's neighbours Chad and Libya are seen as having a role to play
in bringing the conflict travel to Tripoli on Sunday to meet Libyan
leader Moamer Khadafi, Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir and Chadian
and Egyptian representatives for an AU mini-summit on the fighting.

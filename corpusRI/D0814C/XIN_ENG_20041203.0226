<P>
A Sudanese rebel leader said in Pretoria on Friday that an agreement
between the Sudanese government and rebels would be concluded by Dec.
31 as required by the United Nations Security Council Resolution
adopted in Kenyan capital Nairobi last month.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) chairman Paul
Garang told a press conference that efforts to bring peace to the
Darfur region would get impetus from the pending conciliation accord.
</P>
<P>
"We are very optimistic, in fact not only optimistic -- we have
committed ourselves to signing the peace agreement," he told
reporters after briefing South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma in
Pretoria about progress with negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said South Africa was "very positive" about progress made with
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Garang said on Friday he would travel to Naivasha of Kenya in two
days for talks with Sudanese First Vice President Ali Osman Mohamed
to ensure the peace process was concluded and signed by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Current peace talks in Naivasha were not only about a resolution to
the conflict, he stressed. They were expected to yield a new
coalition government and a peaceful democratic transformation of the
whole country.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a new political dynamic in Khartoum that will be
better placed to address the issues in Darfur," Garang said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese civil war started in 1983 when the SPLM/A took up arms
fighting for self-determination in the southern part of the country,
which has left some two million people dead, mostly through
war-induced famine and disease.
</P>
<P>
As Africa's largest country, Sudan's western Darfur region has also
plunged into conflict since February 2003, when two rebel forces took
up arms against the Khartoum government, accusing the authorities of
not protecting them from the attacks of "Janjaweed" militia and
demanding autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The Darfur crisis has been termed by the United Nations as the
world's worst humanitarian crisis, in which thousands were killed and
one million displaced.

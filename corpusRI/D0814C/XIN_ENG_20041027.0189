<P>
The third day of peace talks on the crisis in Sudan's Darfur region
adjourned Wednesday morning hardly an hour into the discussions in
Nigerian capital Abuja, after the African Union (AU) mediators asked
for more time to prepare a document on security.
</P>
<P>
"The document on security when prepared, shall be tabled for
discussion" later in the afternoon, Mohammed Yusuf, a staff of
humanitarian affair to the ongoing talks in Abuja, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said all sides required a little time to study the document but
shall do so quickly to improve the situation in Darfur.
</P>
<P>
The disagreement on the sensitive security issue has led to the
collapse of the first round of peace talks in Abuja a month ago.
However, "all the parties now have better positions," said Yusuf.
</P>
<P>
The decision to table the issue of security at Wednesday's talks was
contrary to indications Tuesday that the issue of politics, involving
power and wealth sharing, shall be tackled.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tugod, spokesmen for the Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM),
one of the two rebel groups in Darfur, said at that time Wednesday
will witness a "declaration on principles."
</P>
<P>
"It's better to focus on, immediately, the political issue we are
looking for ... we want to make a breakthrough," Tugod said.
</P>
<P>
He added the talks now focused on the political issue, because the
first round, which ran between Aug. 23 and Sept. 17, concentrated on
humanitarian and security issues but "took a lot of time and ended in
a deadlock."
</P>
<P>
Prior to Wednesday's talks, Ibrahim Mohammed Ibrahim, spokesmen for
the Sudanese government, reaffirmed the willingness of his government
to talk the political issue with the rebels as the issue of power and
wealth sharing contained in the federal system of Sudan had been
developing since 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Every state has its autonomy with a self government and constitution
with little guidelines from the federal government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Delegates said both sides were ready for political talks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clashes in Sudan's Darfur flared up in February 2003, and has so far
caused thousands of deaths and sent about one million fleeing to
neighboring Chad or internally displaced.

<P>
A retired FBI official, Mark Felt, 
was the "Deep Throat" source who leaked secrets to two Washington 
Post reporters about the Watergate scandal that brought down former 
president Richard Nixon, his family said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Felt's grandson, Nick Jones, made the claim in a statement read 
to reporters outside the family home in Santa Rosa, California, 
following an article in Vanity Fair in which Felt told the magazine 
he was "Deep Throat."
</P>
<P>
The identity of the person who provided Washington Post 
reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with crucial information 
about the Watergate cover-up has been one of journalism's most 
enduring mysteries.
</P>
<P>
Woodward and Bernstein have said they will not reveal the 
identity of "Deep Throat" until his death.
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather is pleased that he is being honored for his role 
as Deep Throat with his friend Bob Woodward," said the statement 
read by his grandson Jones.
</P>
<P>
"The family believes my grandfather, Mark Felt Sr., is a great 
American hero who went well and above the call of duty at much risk 
to himself," the statement said. "We all sincerely hope the country 
will see him this way, as well.
</P>
<P>
"Mark had expressed reservations in the past about revealing his 
identity and about whether his actions were appropriate for an FBI 
man," the statement said. "But as he recently told my mother, I 
guess people used to think Deep Throat was a criminal. But now they 
think he's a hero."
</P>
<P>
The statement also called for reporters to respect the privacy 
of Felt, who is 91.

The daughter of the former FBI agent who was revealed this week as "Deep Throat"
has acknowledged that money played a role in the family's decision to go
public.

<P>
W. Mark Felt, 91, was the key source in The Washington Post's Watergate
investigation that helped bring down President Richard Nixon. Felt stepped
forward last week, ending a three-decade debate about the source's true
identity.

<P>
"He is relieved to get the secret off his chest," Joan Felt said of her father
in an interview published Sunday in The Press Democrat.
</P>
<P>
Joan Felt, 61, told the newspaper there were many reasons her family wanted to
reveal the elder Felt's role in Watergate after three decades, but added, "I
won't deny that to make money is one of them." Some literary agents have said
the family could earn more than $1 million (euro810,000) from a book
deal.

<P>
"My son, Nick, is in law school and he'll owe $100,000 (euro81,374) by the time
he graduates," she said. "I am still a single mom, still supporting them to one
degree or another, and I am not ashamed of this."
</P>
<P>
Joan Felt said her father suffered a stroke in 2001 and has undergone surgeries
for heart problems and a broken hip but is still lucid.
</P>
<P>
"We had to help him see that most of the world now considers what he did
heroic," she said. "At the time it was happening, he wouldn't have gotten that
percentage of support, but history has shown it was so important what he
did."

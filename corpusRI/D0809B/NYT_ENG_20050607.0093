DEEP THROAT ANALYSTS SAY FELT MUST HAVE HAD HELP FROM INSIDE THE FBI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A retired FBI agent's assertion this week that several bureau officials
collaborated to leak information about the Watergate investigation to The
Washington Post did not surprise experts who have dissected the
case for decades.
</P>
<P>
Some have long speculated that the media source known as Deep
Throat didn't act alone, but Paul V. Daly's account of
firsthand knowledge about the case has helped fuel renewed interest
in what had become one of history's great modern mysteries.
Daly's disclosure came on the heels of former FBI Deputy
Director W. Mark Felt's admission last week that he was
Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
According to Daly, who headed the Albany, N.Y., field office for
six years beginning in 1980, Felt was part of a
clandestine group of high-ranking officials who agreed to leak information
about the Watergate break-in so that the publicity would counteract
White House efforts to quash the probe.
</P>
<P>
He identified the others -- all deceased -- as Richard Long,
who was chief of the FBI's white-collar crimes section during
Watergate; Robert G. Kunkel, agent-in-charge of the Washington field office,
which led the Watergate burglary investigation; and Charles Bates, who
was assistant director of the FBI's criminal investigative division.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very, very possible because it explains some of
the reasons why Felt could do it and why we
thought he could not do it, because he had help,"
said Bill Gaines, who teaches an investigative journalism class at
the University of Illinois and has studied Deep Throat extensively.
</P>
<P>
Daly's account "throws new light on the Felt story and makes
much sense," said Gaines, who led a class that sifted
through thousands of pages of FBI documents while researching the
case.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the class fingered Fred Fielding, deputy to former
White House counsel John Dean during the Nixon administration, as
Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
"But we were led away from the FBI by several misleading
statements in 'All the President's Men' and the Post," said
Gaines, a two-time Pulitzer-Prize winner. "Now the possibility appears that
additional information from other sources is included in the book
and attributed to Deep Throat."
</P>
<P>
Neither Felt nor his family responded to an inquiry left on
their telephone answering machine at their residence in Santa Rosa,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Ben Bradlee, the Post editor during Watergate,
said he always thought that Felt had help. There were
other FBI officials who agreed with Felt's concerns about White
House efforts to quash the investigation, Bradlee said. .
</P>
<P>
"I have always presumed that it wasn't just Felt, or, (that)
there were people who were helping him," Bradlee said. "The
FBI was in a bit of upheaval. I think there
was some circling of the wagons."
</P>
<P>
Last week, Felt revealed in a Vanity Fair magazine article that
he was Deep Throat, whose leaks to Washington Post reporter
Bob Woodward helped steer that paper's Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of
Watergate. The stories helped bring down the Nixon administration, led
to the conviction of several top-ranking federal officials, including a
former attorney general and the White House chief of staff,
and prompted fundamental changes in U.S. intelligence oversight.
</P>
<P>
John W. Dean III, who was Nixon's White House counsel and
later served time for his role in Watergate, also said
he was not surprised by Daly's disclosure. Deep Throat "could
not have done it alone," Dean said.
</P>
<P>
Daly said Long shared the story of Deep Throat during a
meeting in
</P>
<P>
1978 in Washington, D.C., when they were discussing the disclosure of
documents and potential testimony in the pending prosecution of Felt,
Gray and Edward S. Miller, who was an assistant director
with the FBI's intelligence division.
</P>
<P>
The three were accused of authorizing nine break-ins at the homes
of friends and relatives of members of the Weather Underground,
an anti-war group that had taken responsibility for bombing public
buildings in the early 1970s. At the time, Daly's job
was to facilitate the turning over of FBI documents for
the trials.
</P>
<P>
Daly said Long told him there might be a problem should
Felt opt to testify at his trial.
</P>
<P>
Long then spelled out how he, Bates, Kunkel and others had
funneled information to Felt that was then leaked to the
press.
</P>
<P>
But not everyone believes the account.
</P>
<P>
Kunkel's son, Robert, who lives in Virginia, on Monday denied that
his father had supported Felt or took part in leaking
information to The Washington Post, calling Daly's account "ludicrous."
</P>
<P>
"My father never briefed Mark Felt. He never conspired with Charlie
</P>
<P>
Bates to deal with Mark Felt," said Kunkel, 49, who was
a law enforcement officer and is now a car salesman.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Mr. Felt was asking for information, but I also
know that dad was trying to hold information back. ...
I can remember my father being very frustrated during the
time wondering who or what Deep Throat was."
</P>
<P>
Also, Robert Kunkel said his father confided in him years later
that he believed someone else, other than Felt, was responsible
for the leaks.
</P>
<P>
"He flat-out thought someone else was Deep Throat," Kunkel said.
</P>
<P>
Still, Kunkel said his father was frustrated by attempts from top-level
officials, including Gray, to stonewall the investigation. He recalled, as
a teenager, watching his father's brown hair "turn snow white"
during the long Watergate investigation.
</P>
<P>
"He would come home at night just absolutely fuming," Kunkel said.
"Then he would be back to work the next day
with ideas of how to get around whatever road blocks
they would set up."
</P>
<P>
But one veteran FBI official, who spoke on condition he not
be identified, said he knew Kunkel well and that it's
possible he kept the story -- Daly's account -- from
his family.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody at that level shared anything with their wife or kids,"
he said. "First of all, they had a tendency to
repeat things and some stuff was so sensitive you'd end
up in jail. I can assure you Kunkel didn't."
</P>
<P>
Members of the FBI group, according to Daly, each brought snippets
of information to the table. Felt, who was the bureau's
second-in-command, would glean information from the others, and that was
part of the reason FBI and White House efforts to
find Deep Throat were thwarted. No one person could have
known everything that Woodward and Carl Bernstein were reporting, Daly
and others have said.
</P>
<P>
In Felt's 1979 book, "The FBI Pyramid from the Inside," he
acknowledged receiving daily reports from Kunkel. He also wrote that
White House officials, including Dean, who was convicted of a
felony for role in the Watergate scandal, regularly demanded access
to the case information.
</P>
<P>
Gaines, who has reviewed more than 15,000 pages of FBI documents
related to Watergate, said Daly's account has helped add intrigue
to Felt's admission.
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is kind of shredded in my mind now,"
he said. "Felt would not have known (everything that was
being leaked), and someone else would've had to tell him.
It seems to me it really impeaches what Woodward and
Bernstein have written and said about Deep Throat being a
one-person source."

Identity of Long-Mysterious 'Deep Throat' Revealed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deep Throat, the secret source whose insider guidance was vital to
The Washington Post's groundbreaking coverage of the Watergate
scandal, was a pillar of the FBI named W. Mark Felt, The Post
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
As the bureau's second- and third-ranking official during a period
when the FBI was battling for its independence against the
administration of President Richard M. Nixon, Felt had the means and
the motive to help uncover the web of internal spies, secret
surveillance, dirty tricks and coverups that led to Nixon's
unprecedented resignation on Aug. 9, 1974, and to prison sentences for
some of Nixon's highest-ranking aides.
</P>
<P>
Felt's identity as Washington's most celebrated secret source had
been an object of speculation for more than 30 years until Tuesday,
when his role was revealed by his family in a Vanity Fair magazine
article. Even Nixon was caught on tape speculating that Felt was ``an
informer'' as early as February 1973, at a time when Deep Throat was
supplying confirmation and context for some of The Post's most
explosive Watergate stories.
</P>
<P>
But Felt's repeated denials, and the stalwart silence of the
reporters he aided -- Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein -- kept the cloak
of mystery drawn up around Deep Throat. ``He knew he was taking a
monumental risk,'' said Woodward, now an assistant managing editor of
The Post,whose catalogue of prizewinning and best-selling work has
been built on the sort of confidential relationships he maintained
with Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
Felt also knew, by firsthand experience, that Nixon's
administration was willing to use wiretaps and break-ins to hunt down
leakers, so no amount of caution was too great in his mind. Woodward
rode multiple taxis, sometimes in the wrong direction, and often
walked long distances to reach the middle-of-the-night meetings.
</P>
<P>
Woodward and Bernstein expressed a concern that the Deep Throat
story has, over the years, come to obscure the many other elements
that went into exposing the Watergate story: other sources, other
investigators, high-impact Senate hearings, a shocking trove of secret
White House tape recordings and the decisive intervention of a
unanimous U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
``Felt's role in all this can be overstated,'' said Bernstein, who
went on after Watergate to a career of books, magazine articles and
television investigations. ``When we wrote the book, we didn't think
his role would achieve such mythical dimensions. You see there that
Felt/Deep Throat largely confirmed information we had already gotten
from other sources.''
</P>
<P>
Felt, 91 and enfeebled by a stroke, lives in California.

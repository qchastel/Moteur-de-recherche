<TEXT>
<P>
Washington Post reporters Bob 
Woodward and Carl Bernstein confirmed Tuesday that former FBI 
number-two W. Mark Felt was the "Deep Throat" source who helped 
unravel the Watergate scandal and bring down President Richard 
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
"W. Mark Felt was 'Deep Throat' and helped us immeasurably in 
our Watergate coverage," Woodward and Bernstein said in a statement 
carried on The Washington Post web site.
</P>
<P>
"However, as the record shows, many other sources and officials 
assisted us and other reporters for the hundreds of stories that 
were written in The Washington Post about Watergate," they added.
</P>
<P>
Woodward, Bernstein and Ben Bradlee, the Post's executive editor 
when the Watergate story broke in 1972, said they kept the identity 
of "Deep Throat" secret at Felt's request, saying his name would be 
revealed upon his death.
</P>
<P>
"We've kept that secret because we keep our word," Woodward 
said.
</P>
<P>
They said they had decided to break their silence after Felt, 
now 91 and in declining health, was identifed as "Deep Throat" by 
his family and Vanity Fair magazine.
</P>
<P>
The Post said Woodward, now a Post assistant managing editor, 
will write an article for Thursday's newspaper about his and 
Bernstein's experience covering Watergate.
</P>
<P>
"The thing that stuns me is that the goddamn secret has lasted 
this long," Bradlee was quoted as saying by the Post.
</P>
<P>
Bradlee said he had learned the "positional identity" of "Deep 
Throat" as the Post was breaking its Watergate stories and had 
learned his name just after Nixon's resignation in August 1974.
</P>
<P>
"The number-two guy at the FBI, that was a pretty good source," 
Bradlee was quoted as saying. "I knew the paper was on the right 
track," Bradlee added. The "quality of the source" and the soundness 
of his guidance made him sure of that.
</P>
<P>
Felt's family confirmed earlier Tuesday that the retired FBI 
official had been "Deep Throat" -- one of the best kept journalistic 
secrets of all time.
</P>
<P>
The Post said the Watergate break-in in January 1972 came 
shortly after the death of legendary FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, 
who was Felt's mentor.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Woodward as saying that Felt had hopes of becoming the 
FBI director but Nixon appointed an official from his 
administration, L. Patrick Gray, to the post.
</P>
<P>
Bradlee said that over the years, "it was interesting to watch 
people flounder around with odd choices" about the identity of "Deep 
Throat," a nickname borrowed from the title of a pornographic film.
</P>
<P>
Although he knew the identity, Bradlee said: "I've never met 
Felt. I wouldn't know him if I fell on him."

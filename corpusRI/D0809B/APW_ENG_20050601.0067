Felt rose through the ranks to become FBI's No. 2, and `Deep Throat'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
W. Mark Felt wanted to become FBI director. President Richard M. Nixon and his
closest aides thought that ambition might make Felt the ideal person to
sidetrack an FBI investigation into the Watergate burglary.
</P>
<P>
They couldn't have been more wrong.
</P>
<P>
Rather than helping shield Nixon, Felt became the best-known anonymous source in
history. As "Deep Throat," he was a key figure in uncovering the scandal that
eventually led to Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Information was traveling from Felt, the No. 2 official at the FBI, to the news
columns of The Washington Post via reporter Bob Woodward, snippets from a
criminal investigation that led ultimately to the president.
</P>
<P>
The Post on its Web site Tuesday quoted Woodward as saying that Felt helped the
newspaper at a time of tense relations between the White House and much of the
FBI hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover died shortly before the Watergate break-in. Felt
himself had hopes that he would be the next FBI director, according to the Post,
but President Nixon instead appointed an administration insider, assistant
attorney general L. Patrick Gray III, to the post.
</P>
<P>
Felt's ambition was no secret, as White House tape recordings from the Watergate
scandal show.
</P>
<P>
Six days after the break-in at the offices of the Democratic National Committee,
President Nixon and his co-conspirators discussed ordering the FBI to shut down
its probe, on grounds that the investigation would interfere with a CIA
operation.
</P>
<P>
"Mark Felt wants to cooperate because he's ambitious," White House chief of
staff H.R. Haldeman said.
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," the president replied.
</P>
<P>
Months later on the Watergate tapes, Nixon and his aides discussed Felt as a
possible leaker.
</P>
<P>
"We know who leaked it," Haldeman said on Oct. 19, 1972.
</P>
<P>
"Somebody in the FBI?" Nixon asked.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir, Mark Felt," Haldeman replied.
</P>
<P>
The Post's executive editor during Watergate, Ben Bradlee, said Tuesday it's a
good thing for the country that Felt's identity has finally been
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Bradlee has never met Felt, but "I would thank him" if the two men ever did get
together, Bradlee said.
</P>
<P>
Felt had a storied career at the bureau, one that also had its share of
controversy.
</P>
<P>
A jury found him guilty in 1980 of violating civil rights by authorizing
warrantless searches at homes of friends and relatives of left-wing fugitives
during the early 1970s. President Ronald Reagan pardoned him, along with another
former FBI official convicted in the case. Felt and his co-defendant had argued
they were authorized by their boss, Gray, who was then the acting FBI director,
to approve break-ins without first going to court for a warrant.
</P>
<P>
In breaking the story that Felt was "Deep Throat," Vanity Fair magazine wrote of
his ascent inside the bureau run at the time by Hoover.
</P>
<P>
"In a move to rein in his power-seeking head of domestic intelligence, William
C. Sullivan, Hoover promoted Felt to a newly created position overseeing
Sullivan, vaulting Felt to prominence," the magazine wrote.
</P>
<P>
A magazine named Felt as the likely Deep Throat in 1974, prompting a denial from
Felt and a threat to sue that he never followed up on.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, former Post reporter James Mann wrote in The Atlantic Monthly that Deep
Throat was certainly in the FBI, and named Felt as one of three likely
candidates. In the 2002 book "The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI,"
another former Post reporter, Ronald Kessler, wrote that Deep Throat was
probably Felt.
</P>
<P>
Born in Twin Falls, Idaho, in 1913, he graduated from the University of Idaho,
went to George Washington University Law School and joined the FBI in
1942.

WASHINGTON, June 1
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former FBI deputy director Mark Felt 
was hailed as a hero and denounced as a villain Wednesday after 
confessing to being the Watergate scandal's "Deep Throat" -- a 
disclosure that startled even President George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
Felt's family and The Washington Post, which spearheaded press 
coverage of the Watergate cover-up in the early 1970s, confirmed 
that Felt was the celebrated anonymous source whose leaks helped 
bring down President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
"I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat," Felt, now 91, told 
Vanity Fair in an article published that was the talk of the nation 
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"All I can tell you is that it was a revelation that caught me 
by surprise," President Bush told reporters, summing up the feeling 
of many in the Washington establishment.
</P>
<P>
"For those of us who grew up, got out of college in the late 
'60s, the Watergate story was a relevant story," Bush said. "And a 
lot of us have always wondered who Deep Throat might have been. And 
the mystery was solved yesterday."
</P>
<P>
Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was appointed by Nixon as 
the US ambassador to NATO, in the 1970s, gave a guarded response 
when asked if he thought Felt had been right to leak confidential 
information.
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm not in any judgmental mood," Rumsfeld told a Pentagon 
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Prepared in strict secrecy by the magazine, the Vanity Fair 
article flat-footed former Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl 
Bernstein who, along with the newspaper's former editor Ben Bradlee, 
had kept Felt's identity secret for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
After initially refusing to confirm Felt as the source, Woodward 
and Bernstein eventually gave in. "Mark Felt was Deep Throat and 
helped us immeasurably in our Watergate coverage," the statement 
said.
</P>
<P>
The two were preparing a major article about their contacts with 
Deep Throat to be published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deep Throat met with Woodward several times to help break 
stories about the involvement of Nixon administration officials in 
the June 17, 1972 burglary of the Democratic National Committee 
headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The scandal ultimately led to Nixon becoming the first US 
president to resign in August 1974.
</P>
<P>
Felt's grandson, Nick Jones, described his grandfather as "a 
great American hero" and said his family hoped the country would see 
him the same way.
</P>
<P>
But not everyone did -- especially former Nixon aides.
</P>
<P>
G. Gordon Liddy, a Nixon operative who served four and a half 
years in prison for engineering the Watergate break-in, said Felt 
"violated the ethics of the law enforcement profession," while 
former Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan bluntly labelled him a 
"traitor."
</P>
<P>
Chuck Colson, the head of White House communications in 1972, 
said Felt could have helped America avoid a wrenching political 
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Mark Felt could have stopped Watergate," said Colson. "He was 
in a position of that kind of influence. Instead, he goes out and 
basically undermines the administration."
</P>
<P>
Felt's disclosure received a more positive reception in the 
press, with several leading US dailies on Wednesday hailing Deep 
Throat as a prime example of how anonymous sources can keep 
government abuse in check.
</P>
<P>
Hal Holbrook, the actor who played the Deep Throat character in 
the 1976 Watergate movie "All The President's Men" said he thought 
Felt had been driven by a "higher purpose."
</P>
<P>
"The important thing was not who it was, but why he did it," 
Holbrook said. "It's called morality. That is something that is not 
very popular today." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said his grandfather had initially previously expressed 
deep reservations about revealing his secret.
</P>
<P>
"But as he recently told my mother, 'I guess people used to 
think Deep Throat was a criminal. But now they think he's a hero,'" 
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
Felt's family had no idea about his secret until 2002, when 
Felt's close friend and frequent social companion, Yvette La Garde, 
told his daughter Joan that Felt had confided to being Woodward's 
source.
</P>
<P>
The Vanity Fair article said Joan confronted her father, who 
initially denied it, but after she explained La Garde's disclosure, 
he responded: "Since that's the case, well, yes I am."
</P>
<P>
He finally gave in to family pressure to go public when his 
daughter persuaded him that the story could bring some financial 
benefit that would help pay for his grandchildren's education.
</P>
<P>
With the secret finally out, The New York Times said Watergate 
aficionados would mourn the end to a 30-year cottage industry of 
Deep Throat speculation.
</P>
<P>
"It's a little like discovering that Superman's secret identity 
was, well -- Clark Kent," the newspaper said.

EX-FBI CHIEF CALLS DEEP THROAT'S UNMASKING A SHOCK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
L. Patrick Gray III, the acting director of the
FBI at the time of the Watergate break-in, ended more
than three decades of silence about his role in the
scandal, saying in a television interview broadcast Sunday that he
felt shock and betrayal by the disclosure that his former
deputy, W. Mark Felt, was Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on the ABC News program "This Week," Gray
said he felt "like I was hit with a tremendous
sledgehammer" by Felt's recent disclosure that he was the secret
source for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, The Washington Post
reporters who broke important Watergate news relying on Felt's information.
</P>
<P>
Gray, 88, resigned from the FBI in disgrace in 1973. In
the ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos, he spoke bitterly of
Felt, saying, "He told me time and again he was
not Deep Throat."
</P>
<P>
If he could, Gray said, he would say to Felt: "Mark,
why? Why didn't you come to me? Why didn't we
work it out together?" Gray said he now realized that
he failed to halt news leaks from the bureau during
Watergate because Felt was in charge of stopping them.
</P>
<P>
"I think he fooled me, if you want to put it
that way, Mr. Stephanopoulos, by being the perfect example of
the FBI agent that he was," Gray said, according to
a transcript of the interview. "He did his job well,
he did it thoroughly, and I trusted him all along,
and I was, I can't begin to tell you how
deep was my shock and my grief when I found
that it was Mark Felt."
</P>
<P>
Gray's memories of events seemed sharp and his words were punctuated
by flashes of anger as he defended his actions and
insisted that he had been badly misled not only by
Felt but also by President Richard M. Nixon and his
aides.
</P>
<P>
In his 1979 book, "The FBI Pyramid From the Inside," Felt
wrote contemptuously of Gray as an absentee director who compromised
the bureau's independence by mishandling the break-in inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Of his former subordinate, Gray said in the ABC interview, "He
was a smooth operator, and I can't understand how Mark
could have let himself do to me what he did
when I trusted him so implicitly."

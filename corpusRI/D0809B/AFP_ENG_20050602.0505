"Deep Throat": Chronicle of a scoop

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years of negotiations, furtive 
planning and a team of editors sworn to silence allowed Vanity Fair 
to scoop The Washington Post on a story that, by rights, had 
belonged to the newspaper for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The celebrity magazine's naming this week of former FBI 
assistant director Mark Felt as the famed Watergate source, "Deep 
Throat," was sensational on two levels -- the revelation itself and 
the fact that the Post, which had a proprietary grasp on Felt's 
secret for so long, was caught wholly flat-footed.
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea it was coming," admitted Ben Bradlee, the Post's 
executive editor during the Watergate era and, along with reporters 
Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, a guardian of Deep Throat's true 
identity for three decades.
</P>
<P>
The road to Vanity Fair's scoop began in 2003 with an 
unsolicited call to the monthly's editor Graydon Carter from a San 
Francisco lawyer, John O'Connor, who said he represented a client 
who was Deep Throat and who wanted to reveal his identity in the 
magazine.
</P>
<P>
According to Vanity Fair contributing editor David Friend, the 
magazine initially passed on the story after O'Connor insisted on 
payment for Felt and Felt's family.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor then sought to interest a publisher in getting the 
story out in book form, but failure led him back to Vanity Fair 
barely a year later.
</P>
<P>
Having checked the story with Felt's family and decided to run 
it, the magazine went into clandestine mode, assigning 15 editors 
and staff to the story, all of whom were made to sign 
confidentiality agreements.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the "Deep Throat" tradition of subterfuge, the 
story was codenamed WIG (a corruption of Watergate) and Felt's 
daughter Joan, a key source, began referring to her father as "Joe 
Camel."
</P>
<P>
As the publication date neared, the magazine's editors sent the 
issue to the printers with a dummy coverline "The Door Slams."
</P>
<P>
One particular conundrum facing the magazine was whether or not 
to contact Woodward or Bernstein and ask them to confirm that Felt 
was indeed Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
"If we called Woodward ... he could rush into print his own 
article about the source's identity," Graydon Carter said, adding 
that checking the story with Bernstein carried the same risk.
</P>
<P>
"So we didn't call either of them, realising that for 33 years 
they have consistently refused to divulge their source's name 
anyway," Carter said.
</P>
<P>
"And we chose, instead, to verify the facts surrounding this 
amazing tale of intrigue and courage as best we could, using 
alternative and overlapping sources," he said.
</P>
<P>
The final story carried O'Connor's byline, a fact that led some 
observers to question whether the lawyer might have violated the 
attorney-client privilege with the 91-year-old Felt.
</P>
<P>
When the Vanity Fair scoop broke, Woodward and Bernstein's 
initial reaction was to reiterate what they had said for years: that 
they would only reveal Deep Throat's identity when the source died.
</P>
<P>
But The Washington Post newsroom was thrown into confusion with 
the newspaper's executive editor, Leonard Downie, rushing back from 
a company retreat to handle the situation.
</P>
<P>
"I drove back very fast," Downie said.
</P>
<P>
After discussions with Woodward, Bernstein and Bradlee, Downie 
said a conclusion was reached that Felt and his family had released 
them from their promise of confidentiality and that the Post should 
confirm Felt's disclosure.
</P>
<P>
Downie insisted he was not upset at losing the scoop because 
Woodward and the newspaper had behaved "honourably" and "didn't want 
to push Mark Felt into doing something he didn't want to do."
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, meanwhile, said it was strange to have the secret 
known after such a long time.
</P>
<P>
"It's like having tried to protect something precious for all 
these years that you carry around, and for the first time it's not 
there to protect in your pocket anymore. It's a very strange 
feeling," he said. Bernstein added that he felt "relieved of an 
obligation."

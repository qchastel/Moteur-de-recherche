High-ranking officials from Georgia and the separatist region of Abkhazia met
with a United Nations envoy Thursday to discuss security issues in the tense
region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Georgian Minister for Conflict Resolution Georgy Khaindrava
and Abkhazia's foreign minister, Sergei Shamba, took place in the Gali district,
which is patrolled by U.N. monitors.
</P>
<P>
It was to focus on such themes as cooperation between law enforcement
authorities, minimizing bellicose propaganda and providing maps pinpointing the
location of minefields to a British de-mining organization, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed to meet again in mid-June, and they agreed to establish
a joint group to investigate reports of cease-fire violations, Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia has run its own affairs since 1993, when separatists drove out Georgian
government troops. The Black Sea region is not recognized internationally, but
has cultivated closer ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili has vowed to bring Abkhazia and another
separatist region, South Ossetia, back under Tbilisi's rule.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President George W. Bush expressed support for Saakashvili's policy on the
regions during his visit to Tbilisi earlier this week, saying Georgia's
territorial integrity must be respected.
</P>
<P>
The International Red Cross said Thursday that it would end most food aid to
needy Abkhazians because the humanitarian situation in the region was improving.
The group currently gives monthly and quarterly food parcels and hot meals to
more than 13,000 Abkhazian residents.
</P>
<P>
It will provide quarterly aid to some families while providing others with the
opportunity for training in agriculture, commerce or a craft.

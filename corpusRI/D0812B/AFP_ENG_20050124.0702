Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili 
has stressed his determination to bring the separatist republic of 
Abkhazia back into national fold, despite its newly elected leader's 
resolve to go it alone.
</P>
<P>
"As for Abkhazia, we do not intend to yield anything to anyone, 
we will never pretend that nothing happened," Saakashvili told 
reporters late Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Sergei Bagapsh, the new self-styled president 
of this mountainous Black Sea territory said his victory proved 
Abkhazia to be a viable state and pledged to fight on to have its 
de-facto independence internationally recognised.
</P>
<P>
However, Saakashvili shrugged off Bagapsh's statement as coming 
from "a man hard-pressed during a difficult election campaign".
</P>
<P>
"When separatists say they will not return to Georgia, I answer 
-- don't, it is we who will return to Abkhazia," Saakashvili 
quipped.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian leader also called on Russia, whose ties with 
Georgia's separatist republics have long complicated relations 
between Moscow and Tbilisi, to join his efforts.
</P>
<P>
"If Russia helps us resolve regional conflicts, we shall become 
the nicest and sweetest of neighbors," Saakashvili said.
</P>
<P>
A small appendage on Russia's southern flank, Abkhazia won its 
de facto independence from the former Soviet republic Georgia in a 
war shortly after the break up of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili, who rode to power on a wave of popular protests a 
little over a year ago, has pledged to reunite Georgia with Abkhazia 
and South Ossetia, another separatist region, before the end of his 
presidency.

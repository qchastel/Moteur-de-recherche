Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili on Tuesday called for a new Yalta
conference, a voluntary association of new European democracies whose goal would
be to extend the rule of liberty throughout the Black Sea region and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial column in The Washington Post, Saakashvili said the diplomatic
agreement reached at Yalta after World War II by the United States, Britain and
Russia "relegated millions of people to a ruthless tyranny."
</P>
<P>
He said the division of Europe created at Yalta and the Iron Curtain that marked
its boundary were history, with much of the territory allocated to Russian
leader Josef Stalin now democratic nations.
</P>
<P>
"After recent discussions with Presidents Traian Basescu of Romania and Viktor
Yushchenko of Ukraine," Saakashvili said, "I believe it is time for a new Yalta
Conference" with three main goals.
</P>
<P>
He said nations must work together to consolidate democracy in the region, and
said Georgia achieved it only 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
But Saakashvili said two regions of Georgia _ South Ossetia and Abkhazia _
"remain untouched by the freedom the rest of Georgia enjoys. We can and must
resolve these disputes to better the lives of Georgians."
</P>
<P>
He also said other nations in the region must work towards democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Moldova, like Georgia, faces a separatist region that maintains itself with
cast-off Soviet weaponry and the profits from an illicit economy based on
trafficking in weapons, drugs and women," Saakashvili said. "These are the last
razor-sharp splinters of the Soviet empire."
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili said the world can do more to aid the people of Belarus in their
qeust for freedom.
</P>
<P>
"The new Yalta conference will press for liberty in Belarus through increased
travel restrictions on government officials, expanded financial and material
support to the opposition and enhanced training for civic society in the methods
of peaceful protests that helped free the people of Ukraine and Georgia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A new Yalta conference should seek to expand the frontiers of freedom far beyond
the Black Sea, he said, mentioning Cuba, Zimbabwe and Burma.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to return to Yalta." Saakashvili said. "This time we will not engage
in a secret diplomacy in which our values are compromised and our people
enslaved. In this new association of democracies, our diplomacy will be open ...
and we will begin to make Yalta a symbol of hope ."

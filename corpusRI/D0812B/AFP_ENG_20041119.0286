One year after 'rose revolution,' Georgia still burdened by past

<P>
One year ago, young Georgian opposition leader Mikhail Saakashvili led
massive street protests that toppled the old regime after the
parliament was stormed November 22, promising a breath of change to
transform this troubled ex-Soviet republic into a modern state.
</P>
<P>
Having easily swept to the presidency months later, the 36-year-old
US-educated lawyer faced a massive challenge -- widespread
corruption, separatism and economic and social decay had turned one
of the richest regions in the Soviet Union into a massive challenge.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili attacked the problems with the zeal of a revolutionary,
raising heckles from some, praise from others, and all the while
under the watchful eye of Russia and the United States, former Cold
War foes who are vying for influence in the strategic nation.
</P>
<P>
"Without the rose revolution, it would have been a catastrophe, but
Saakashvili continues to have the approach and rhetoric of a
revolutionary," Avto Dzhokharidze of the Caucasus Institute for Peace
and Development said.
</P>
<P>
Critics have accused Saakashvili of being a closet authoritarian, who
has strengthened his power and sees no qualms in going after critics.
</P>
<P>
As evidence, they point to the constitutional changes that he
instituted in January, greatly strengthening his powers at the
expense of the fractious parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Today, there is no more balance of power in Georgia," said Vakhtang
Khmaladze, a former lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
They also say that under his stewardship, media in Georgia have faced
increasing pressure to toe the party line, leading to self-censorship
in the press.
</P>
<P>
"Since he became president, it has become impossible to write
articles criticizing the authorities," said Revaz Okruashvili, an
editor of independent regional newspaper Khalkhis Gazeti.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Saakashvili's aggressive fight against corruption, under
which former top officials have been forced to pay back large sums to
avoid imprisonment, has also raised eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
"The anti-corruption campaign is selective, it depends on the
personal will of the president and not on the law," says Levan
Berdzenishvili, an opposition deputy.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Georgians have nearly all welcomed the disbandment of
the notoriously corrupt traffic police, the bane of every driver, and
its replacement by a small, well-paid force modelled on the US
highway patrol.
</P>
<P>
Separatism remains one of Saakashvili's biggest challenges -- though
Saakashvili succeeded in bringing the semi-autonomous Adjara region
under central control, separatist Abkhazia and South Ossetia show no
intention of following suit.
</P>
<P>
At least 17 Georgian soldiers were killed this summer in clashes with
South Ossetian forces, raisinnew government," the opposition deputy
Berdzenishvili said.
</P>
<P>
While pensions have gone up by two dollars per month, inflation
estimated at 10 percent has eroded the purchasing power of the
population.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Saakashvili has yet to deplete the enormous amount of
hope and trust that he got after assuming power.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a hard year for me, but I still think that Saakashvili is
the best president Georgia could ever have now," said Nino
Aznaurashvili, a 26-year-old former government employee who was fired
after Saakashvili's election.

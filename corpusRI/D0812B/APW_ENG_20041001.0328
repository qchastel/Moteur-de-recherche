Recognized by no one, breakaway Georgian region chooses president in
vote likely to aggravate tensions with Tbilisi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the separatist Black Sea region of Abkhazia choose a new
president Sunday in an election that will throw a new spotlight on
tensions with Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The vote is the first time residents of the breakaway Georgian region
will cast ballots since its leader, Vladislav Ardzinba, took the helm
more than 15 years ago _ when Abkhazia and Georgia were still part of
the Soviet Union. No matter what the outcome, the vote is likely to
increase tensions with Tbilisi, which, under President Mikhail
Saakashvili's leadership, has sought to rein in renegade regions.
</P>
<P>
"It's written in our constitution that Abkhazia is a sovereign
country," said Manana Gurgulia, a well-known Abkhazian journalist.
"All candidates for president are unanimous on this question.
Abkhazia will never be part of Georgia."
</P>
<P>
The five candidates running for president have focused their rhetoric
on Abkhazia's languishing economy, which has been crippled by
sanctions from Tbilisi and a lack of international recognition. Most
Abkhazians are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Ardzinba, 59, has been ill in the past year _ reportedly with cancer
_ and largely turned over day-to-day affairs to Prime Minister Raul
Khadzhimba, who is considered the front-runner among the five
candidates.
</P>
<P>
His main challenger is Sergei Bagapsh, head of the Chernomorenergo
state energy company and leader of the United Abkhazia opposition
movement. Bagapsh, who is running with the support of other
opposition groups, has campaigned on promises of raising the average
wage and combatting rampant crime.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we have real hope for these elections," said Arda
Inalipa, 47, who runs a non-governmental organization in the region's
capital, Sukhumi, providing counseling to women who suffered during
the war with Georgia. "It's a difficult situation for us here, but
we're trying to create our own small, democratic republic."
</P>
<P>
Georgia's Minister for Conflict Resolution Georgy Khaindrava said in
Moscow on Friday that all the candidates are anti-Georgian but that
it might be easier to negotiate with Khadzhimba, who he said is
considered to have Russia's backing after a meeting with President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
"For Tbilisi it doesn't really matter who wins, because they don't
have any pro-Georgian politicians at all," Khaindrava told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Since winning a landslide election in January, Saakashvili has
repeatedly vowed to reunify his fractured country. Earlier this year,
he forced the leader of the autonomy-minded Adzharia region, Aslan
Abashidze, to flee to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili has had less luck in bringing Abkhazia and another
region, South Ossetia, back into the fold.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian government troops in a war
in the early 1990s, displacing roughly 300,000 ethnic Georgians. The
region has effectively run its own affairs ever since and cultivated
close ties with Georgia's giant neighbor, Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian peacekeepers have been deployed in the region since 1994, but
Georgia distrusts Russian intentions. Abkhazia's lush Black Sea coast
is a popular destination for Russian tourists, who commonly arrive by
boat. About 70 percent of Abkhazia's residents have Russian
citizenship, and the region uses the Russian ruble _ not the Georgian
lari.
</P>
<P>
Tensions spiked in August after Saakashvili ordered all ships
arriving in Abkhazia to be screened by Georgian customs and
immigration authorities and he ordered patrols to open fire on boats
violating Georgia's waters. The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted
angrily, accusing Georgia of trying to damage the Abkhazian economy.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili has cooled his rhetoric somewhat since the summer. At the
U.N. General Assembly in New York last week, he said Tbilisi was
prepared to offer "the widest possible autonomy" to Abkhazia and
South Ossetia.
</P>
<P>
But as far as Nugzar Ashuba, speaker of the Abkhazian parliament, is
concerned, Saakashvili isn't to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
"Abkhazia never was part of Georgia so how is it possible for us to
have 'the widest possible autonomy'?" Ashuba said.

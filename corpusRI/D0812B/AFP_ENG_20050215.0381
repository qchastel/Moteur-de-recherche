President George W. Bush and 
US-backed President Mikhail Saakashvili on Tuesday discussed 
Tbilisi's handling of political reforms and its prickly pro-Russian 
separatist regions, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
Bush also reiterated "our condolences on last week's death of 
the prime minister, who was a champion of freedom," spokesman Scott 
McClellan said, referring to the February 3 demise of Zurab 
Zhvania.
</P>
<P>
"The two presidents had a good discussion about Georgia's 
ongoing efforts to advance democratic reforms, to fight corruption 
and to expand freedom for the Georgian people," McClellan told 
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"They also discussed the Georgian government's serious 
settlement plan to resolve its separatist conflict in south Ossetia 
by peaceful means," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhvania had been the key interlocutor with Russia over Abkhazia 
and South Ossetia, two separatist regions that the president has 
promised to bring back under Tbilisi's control.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, fighting broke out on the border between Georgia 
and South Ossetia between Georgian and Ossetian forces.
</P>
<P>
"The two leaders underscored their commitment to deepen our 
country's cooperation in pursuit of freedom, prosperity and peace, 
in the region and beyond," said McClellan.

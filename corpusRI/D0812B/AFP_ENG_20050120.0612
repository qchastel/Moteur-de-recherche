<P>
Two Georgian police officers have been 
abducted in South Ossetia in what Georgian authorities described 
Thursday as an attempt to sabotage the peace process with the 
separatist region.
</P>
<P>
The two officers, Lado Chalauri and Gochi Gvimradze, were taken 
hostage by an armed group in the village of Ergneti, on the 
administrative border between South Ossetia and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
The governor of the Georgian border region of Chida Kartli, 
Mikhail Kareli, told AFP that the two officers had been taken to a 
detention centre in Tskhinvali, the major city of South Ossetia, and 
the abduction was designed to disrupt peace talks with the 
separatist region.
</P>
<P>
"The abduction of the Georgian police officers is a provocation 
by the government of (South Ossetian president) Eduard Kokoity," 
Kareli said.
</P>
<P>
"This crime was committed when Georgian authorities and 
non-government organisations are examining the question of a new 
statute for South Ossetia which could bring an end to the conflict 
and bring peace to the people of the region".
</P>
<P>
The head of Georgia's Security Council, Guela Bejouachvili, said 
security forces were conducting intense negotiations with their 
Ossetian counterparts to free the two police officers as soon as 
possible.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian government was expected to meet soon and the 
worsening of the situation in the conflict zone with South Ossetia 
would be one of the main items on the agenda, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said on January 12 he 
would present official proposals to the separatist and 
Russian-backed territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by the end 
of this month.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia fought a civil war against Georgia with the help of 
Russian mercenaries in the 1990s, and it remains a de facto Russian 
protectorate. Both the government and the opposition reject its 
incorporation into Georgia.
</P>
<P>
South Ossetia also fought a brief war with Tbilisi in the early 
1990s. Moscow has sent peacekeeping troops to the region and has 
granted most of the region's ethnic Ossetian residents Russian 
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Brought to power by a peaceful "rose revolution" one year ago, 
Saakashvili has set reuniting his country as his most urgent 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
Around 100 people, including family and friends of the two 
hostages, gathered Thursday morning in front of the Ergneti border 
post, demanding the authorities take action to free the hostages.

Leading U.S. senator criticizes rising star Obama on lobbying ethics
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
Republican Sen. John McCain accused his Democratic colleague Barack Obama of
"partisan posturing" on the issue of lobbying ethics reform _ a charge Obama
called puzzling and regrettable.
</P>
<P>
The exchange, made in letters between the pair, was the latest sign of trouble
as the two parties try to come up with legislation governing relations with
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
Based on past Obama statements, "I concluded your professed concern for the
institution and the public interest was genuine and admirable," McCain wrote in
a letter to Obama on Monday. "Thank you for disabusing me of such
notions."
</P>
<P>
Obama, a rising star in the Democratic Party, responded in a letter later Monday
that he had "no idea what ... prompted" McCain to strike out like
that.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that you have now questioned my sincerity ... is regrettable but does
not in any way diminish my deep respect for you nor my willingness to find a
bipartisan solution to this problem," Obama wrote.
</P>
<P>
McCain was responding to an earlier Obama letter in which the first-term
Democrat last week thanked McCain for including him in bipartisan talks on
lobbying reform but expressed some differences in approach to the issue spurred
by recent lobbying scandals.
</P>
<P>
McCain, long a backer of legislation to reduce the influence of big money and
special interests in lawmaking, is sponsoring a bill that would require
lobbyists to disclose more information on their activities, including the gifts
they give lawmakers, double to two years the waiting period before a lawmaker
can take a job as a lobbyist and require members to pay charter rates when they
travel on corporate jets.
</P>
<P>
Obama, in last week's letter, promoted a bill backed by House and Senate
Democrats that would take similar action on members becoming lobbyists,
disclosure and corporate jets. It also bans gifts, meals from lobbyists or
organizations that employ lobbyists and creates a new office of public integrity
in the House to monitor compliance of lobbying rules.
</P>
<P>
Obama also questioned the effectiveness of McCain's proposal to set up a task
force to further study the lobbying ethics issue.
</P>
<P>
Aides to McCain confirmed that McCain saw Obama's first letter as partisan. "I'm
embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics I failed to
interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in
politics to make self-interested partisan posturing appear more noble," McCain
wrote.
</P>
<P>
"During my short time in the U.S. Senate," Obama responded Monday, "one of the
aspects about this institution that I have come to value most is the
collegiality and the willingness to put aside partisan differences to work on
issues that help the American people. It was in this spirit that I approached
you to work on ethics reform, and it was in this spirit that I agreed to attend
your bipartisan meeting last week."
</P>
<P>
Obama, the first black man in the Senate in 25 years and only the fifth in
history, became an overnight celebrity with his keynote address to the
Democrats' 2004 party convention. Almost overnight, Obama, the son of a black
father from Kenya and a white mother from the U.S., became a darling of the
party.
</P>
<P>
The guilty plea by former lobbyist Jack Abramoff early this year to various
felony charges involving his attempts to influence Congress touched off numerous
efforts by Republicans and Democrats to move legislation tightening up
restrictions on interactions with lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
But initial promises by the two parties to work together have been hard to keep,
with Republicans irritated by Democratic attempts to link the lobbying issue to
what they call a Republican "culture of corruption."
</P>
<P>
Attempts by the House Republican leadership to craft a Republican bill have also
met resistance from some in the party's rank-and-file who say a total ban on
gifts and privately financed travel is an overreaction to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Majority Leader Bill Frist has asked the Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee to vote on a bill the week of Feb. 27. The top
Democrat on that panel, Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, is a cosponsor of the
McCain bill.

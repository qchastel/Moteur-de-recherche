</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a fatherless young boy, he was caught between cultures and
shuttled between relatives, but the mature Barack Obama appears to
lead a charmed life.
</P>
<P>
A relatively obscure Senate hopeeal on November 2.
</P>
<P>
If he carries the day, Obama will become the only black Senator in
Washington and only the third black Senator in 150 years, thanks not
just to his considerable oratorical skills, but a solid legislative
record and some impressive academic credentials.
</P>
<P>
"The skinny kid with the funny name," as Obama has described himself,
grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia, the son of a Kenyan father and a
Midwestern mother from Kansas, the white daughter of a farmer and
driller.
</P>
<P>
The marriage did not last and Obama's mother remarried and took her
young son to live with a second husband in Indonesia for several
years.
</P>
<P>
After high school, Obama attended Columbia University and Harvard Law
School -- and later became the first black American president of the
influential Harvard Law Review.
</P>
<P>
In between times, he was a community organiser in Harlem and on
Chicago's South Side, reputedly two of the nation's toughest black
communities, and after a stint working as a civil rights lawyer, he
plunged into local politics.
</P>
<P>
When it became clear that a seat in the US Senate from Illinois seat
would be up for grabs in November, Obama, then a three-term state
senator jumped into the race.
</P>
<P>
In style and substance, the aspiring senator contrasts with some
other high-profile black political figures, such as the Reverend Al
Sharpton, or one-time presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson, according
to one Chicago political commentator.
</P>
<P>
"He didn't get his start through the church, and he isn't dependent
solely on the black community for his support," said Kenneth Janda, a
political science professor at Chicago's Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
His rhetoric is inclusive, and he has a lot of support among white
liberals and white middle class voters in suburban Chicago, as well
as blacks on the city's South Side.
</P>
<P>
"There is not a black America, and a white America, a Latino America,
and Asian America -- we are one people, all of us pledging allegiance
to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of
America," Obama told the Democratic Convention.

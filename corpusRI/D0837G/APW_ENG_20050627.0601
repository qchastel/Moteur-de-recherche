<P>
Sen. Barack Obama sees parallels between former President Abraham Lincoln's life
and his own, but he says the 16th U.S. president credited with freeing U.S.
slaves might not have envisioned a black man occupying the seat he now
holds.
</P>
<P>
Obama, who occupies the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois that Lincoln lost to
Stephen Douglas in 1858, wrote about how Lincoln shaped his life in an upcoming
special issue of Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
"In Lincoln's rise from poverty, his ultimate mastery of language and law, his
capacity to overcome personal loss and remain determined in the face of repeated
defeat _ in all this, he reminded me not just of my own struggles. He also
reminded me of a larger, fundamental element of American life _ the enduring
belief that we can constantly remake ourselves to fit our larger dreams," Obama
wrote.
</P>
<P>
The issue is on newsstands Monday.
</P>
<P>
Obama, the son of a Kenyan father and American mother who is just the fifth
black senator in U.S. history, also raised questions about Lincoln's role in
ending slavery.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot swallow whole the view of Lincoln as the Great Emancipator," Obama
said. "As a law professor and civil rights lawyer and as an African-American, I
am fully aware of his limited views on race. Anyone who actually reads the
Emancipation Proclamation knows it was more a military document than a clarion
call for justice."
</P>
<P>
And as for what Lincoln may have thought about Obama's election to the Senate in
2004? "He may not have dreamed of that exact outcome. But I like to believe he
would have appreciated the irony," Obama said.

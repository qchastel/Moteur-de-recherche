CHICAGO, Nov 2 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic rising-star Barack Obama Tuesday became the lone African
American Senator, beating ultra-conservative talk show host Alan
Keyes in a landslide in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
Television networks projected that Obama, 43, had soundly defeated
Keyes in the contest to replace a retiring one-term Republican by
some 70 percentage points, snagging a seat for the Democrats in the
narrowly Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
The charismatic Obama, the son of a Kenyan father and American
mother, was a relatively obscure Senate hopeful just a few months ago
but he catapulted to prominence after giving an electrifying keynote
speech at the Democratic National Convention in July.
</P>
<P>
He was one of a handful of blacks running for US Senate seats this
year, including his rival Keyes, but was considered the only
African-American candidate with a realistic chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
Obama becomes only the third black Senator in 150 years. The last
African American to serve in the US Senate was Democrat Carole
Moseley Braun, also of Illinois, who was defeated in 1998 by
Fitzgerald after a single scandal-plagued term.
</P>
<P>
"The skinny kid with the funny name," as Obama has described himself,
grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In the weeks since his much lauded convention speech, Obama came to
have such star power that he was recruited to travel to more than a
dozen states to stump for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry,
as well as fellow congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
"Barack Obama's importance to our party and our effort to recapture
the United States Senate simply cannot be overstated," said Brad
Woodhouse, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Obama is widely touted for a future leadership position in his party
-- possibly even a US presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
When it became clear that a seat in the US Senate from Illinois seat
would be up for grabs in November, Obama, then a three-term state
senator jumped into the race.
</P>
<P>
His rhetoric stresses inclusiveness, and he has a lot of support
among white liberals and white middle class voters in suburban
Chicago, as well as blacks on the city's South Side.
</P>
<P>
"There is not a black America, and a white America, a Latino America,
and Asian America -- we are one people, all of us pledging allegiance
to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of
America," Obama told the Democratic Convention.
</P>
<P>
Republicans' Illinois Senate hopes unraveled this year when candidate
Jack Ryan withdrew over a sex scandal stemming from the release of
steamy court records from a contentious divorce.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans then reached several states away to recruit Keyes, a
conservative radio talk show host from the east coast state of
Maryland to be their standard bearer, but he was resoundingly
rejected by voters.

COORS' INVESTMENT IN SENATE CAMPAIGN REACHES $1 MILLION

<P>
Republican Pete Coors has dumped another $500,000 of his own money
into his U.S. Senate campaign, bringing the total infusion of his
personal cash in the general election to over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Coors becomes the first Colorado Senate candidate to
meet the threshold for the so-called millionaire amendment under
federal campaign finance laws. This may allow his opponent, Attorney
General Ken Salazar, to raise three times the individual contribution
limit of $2,000.
</P>
<P>
Coors, who had $630,000 left last week, said he wanted the extra
money to defend himself against attack ads recently aired by
independent political committees.
</P>
<P>
Salazar, who has $436,000 remaining, called Coors' actions
"desperate."
</P>
<P>
With just over a week before Election Day, it may be too late for a
financial windfall to be turned into a significant advantage for
either campaign, observers said.
</P>
<P>
"There are only nine days left so it's hard to know if this will
really make a difference for either candidate," said Jennifer Duffy
of the Cook Political Report.
</P>
<P>
The Senate race is already the most expensive in state history.
</P>
<P>
The millionaire amendment, passed in 2002, was intended to level the
financial playing field for candidates taking on wealthy opponents.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most glaring example of a candidate using the millionaire
amendment was Barack Obama, an Illinois Democrat running for the U.S.
Senate this year. After his opponent, Blair Hull, dumped roughly $29
million into the primary race, Obama was allowed to collect $12,000
from each individual donor.
</P>
<P>
Salazar, however, raised $1.2 million more than Coors before the beer
executive's last self-contribution, so it is unclear whether the
Federal Election Commission will allow Salazar to increase his
contribution limit.
</P>
<P>
"The formula we use takes into consideration the money the other
candidate has and their ability to raise money," said FEC spokesman
Ian Striton last week, when discussing the amendment generally.
</P>
<P>
Jim Carpenter, Salazar's campaign manager, said lawyers had advised
the campaign otherwise. In fact, part of the formula takes into
account the funds Salazar had through Dec. 31 of last year, which
were zero.
</P>
<P>
Either way, Salazar's campaign must show the FEC it can raise more
money from individual donors who have maxed out.
</P>
<P>
Coors, a brewery executive, appears to be the fourth Senate candidate
nationally who has at least reached the threshold of the amendment,
Duffy said.

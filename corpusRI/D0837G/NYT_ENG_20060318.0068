BUT WILL THEY LOVE HIM TOMORROW?

<P>
Most politicians spend their careers working to overcome flaws.
Then there are politicians like Barack Obama.
</P>
<P>
So charismatic that his greatest challenge has been trying to play
down expectations during his first Senate term, Obama's enviable plight
was neatly underlined at a black-tie dinner here last weekend,
as President Bush facetiously tried to roast him.
</P>
<P>
"Senator Obama, I want to do a joke on you," the
president told the audience at the annual Gridiron dinner, an
event where politicians and the press mingle to make fun
of one another. "But doing a joke on you is
like doing a joke on the pope. Give me something
to work with. Mispronounce something."
</P>
<P>
Ribbing aside, Obama's seeming perfection -- as a gifted orator, award-winning
author and proven intellect who was the first black president
of the Harvard Law Review -- has become something of
a political marvel in itself, as Democrats survey the landscape
of potential presidential candidates and endlessly wonder if he is
the one to lead them back into favor after a
season of darkness.
</P>
<P>
But such grand expectations can, by turns, be a curse --
not only for Obama himself but for the party overall.
From William Jennings Bryan, who electrified the populace with his
1896 "cross of gold" speech, to former Sen. John Edwards,
who briefly dazzled the Democratic Party before fizzling out in
the 2004 presidential race, fledgling superstars have often learned the
perils of soaring expectations the hard way.
</P>
<P>
"Perfection is always risky," said Darrell M. West, a professor of
politics at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
If Obama's popularity and reputation among Democrats grow, will it be
possible, his advisers and other Democrats wonder, for Obama to
maintain his smooth trajectory over time? How can he lower
expectations, to reduce the impact of any future misstep? Could
voters and the press tire of his impeccability, and start
looking harder for flaws? (One admitted speck: A smoking habit
that he is working to break, and a past experimentation
with drugs.)
</P>
<P>
Historians and political strategists see lessons for the senator's future in
the stories of wunderkinds from the past.
</P>
<P>
"The ones who have been successful were very focused in understanding
where they wanted to go, and had a good strategy
to get there," West said. "You can't wait too long
because golden boys only last so long and then they
start to tarnish. And then they just become one of
the pack, and there's nothing special about them."
</P>
<P>
To some, at this early stage, Obama is most directly comparable
with John F. Kennedy, whose youth, dashing looks and captivating
speaking skills catapulted him to national stardom in 1956, when,
as a first-term senator, he campaigned for the vice presidential
nomination; four years later he was elected president. His assassination
in 1963 raised him to the category of permanent golden
status among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Of course, that was a time when it was easier to
sparkle. Kennedy benefited from a cozy press corps that largely
left personal issues alone, something Obama could never count on.
</P>
<P>
Other political stars have fallen over time, as shining promise has
given way to the inevitable disappointment of reality.
</P>
<P>
Even when he was still a basketball player, well before he
was elected to the Senate, Bill Bradley seemed destined for
greatness. He dominated the spotlight for a time, but stumbled,
and his political career ended in the Democratic presidential primaries
in 2000. John Edwards made a splash when elected to
the Senate in 1998, but he quickly suffered from criticism
that he was light on gravitas and failed to live
up to some expectations that he was the next Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin argued that Bryan, the three-time Democratic
presidential nominee, dazzled the country in a way comparable to
the Obama phenomenon with that one speech in 1896. But
he faced too much resistance to his perceived radical populism
to win election and, having lost, wore the indelible taint
of failure. History has not been kind.
</P>
<P>
Robert Dallek, the author of several presidential biographies, said that such
"golden boy" leaders have emerged "in a time of frustration
and disillusionment," but that few, apart from Kennedy, sustained the
momentum. "Kennedy hadn't done much, there wasn't much of a
congressional record you could point to, and so people said,
'Wow, this guy has got imagination and principles,"' Dallek said.
</P>
<P>
More recently, glamorous governors like Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Mitt
Romney of Massachusetts, both Republicans, have lost some of their
luster after clashing with state legislatures. By that standard, Mark
Warner, a Democrat and the former governor of Virginia, may
have benefited from the law requiring him to step down
after one term; without more of a record to haunt
him, he has had the luxury of picking issues to
champion, unlike his potential rivals in the Senate, who still
must vote on everything from the federal budget to Iraq.
Warner is now among the Democrats contemplating running in 2008.
</P>
<P>
"The longer you are in a position of making the hard
decisions, weighing in on the difficult questions, the weaker you
become," said Mario M. Cuomo, whose rousing 1984 speech at
the Democratic National Convention, during his first term as governor
of New York, fueled a decade of chatter about his
greater political potential before he finally lost a re-election bid
to George Pataki in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"The third term is a killer," Cuomo said. "I had three
terms, and what happens is, people get to know you
so well, and their instinct is to be angry with
the negative more than it is to appreciate the positive."
</P>
<P>
But when asked whether he saw a comparison in his early
rave reviews to those Obama is experiencing now, Cuomo demurred.
"I'm a whole different story," Cuomo said. "I'm not in
his class at all."
</P>
<P>
Still, Obama has yet to finish one term as senator --
a reality he seems keenly aware of, as he lightly
mocks his own press coverage while slowly beginning to promote
his legislative work, like pushing for research on the avian
flu.
</P>
<P>
Obama seems, at times, to be balancing the need to reduce
unrealistic expectations with the wish to retain his golden mystique.
Even in acknowledging, with some embarrassment, his ongoing cigarette smoking
habit, Obama has managed to turn it into an expression
of his imperfection, telling The Chicago Tribune last year: "The
flesh is weak."
</P>
<P>
Obama did not return a call seeking comment, but in his
Gridiron speech, which brought down the house, he tweaked the
press for its fawning coverage so far -- a recurring
theme he has hit upon in response to an excessive
crush of media attention from the start of his political
career.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank you for all the generous advance coverage
you've given me in anticipation of a successful career," Obama
said. "When I actually do something, we'll let you know."
</P>
<P>
And no doubt, when that happens, the world will notice.

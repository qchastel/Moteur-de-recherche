Illinois Democratic Sen. Barack Obama on Tuesday called for a troop reduction in
Iraq and criticized the Bush administration for questioning the patriotism of
people who speak out against the war.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that U.S. forces are still a part of the solution in Iraq," he said
according to a prepared text of Obama's speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign
Relations. "The strategic goals should be to allow for a limited drawdown of
U.S. troops, coupled with shift to a more effective counter-insurgency strategy
that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead and intensifies our efforts to
train Iraqi forces."
</P>
<P>
Following the Dec. 15 Iraqi elections, Obama said the United States should focus
over the course of the next year on how to reduce its troops
there.
</P>
<P>
The freshman senator stressed that he was not calling for an immediate
withdrawal of U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
"It is not appropriate from my perspective for us to unilaterally and
precipitously pull all our troops out immediately. ... The question is can we
reduce our presence in Iraq systematically and ... reduce the enormous strains
on our military that right now is at a breaking point?" Obama told reporters
after his speech.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Allen Abney said the administration's policy has "always
been for a conditions-based withdrawal" from Iraq. But he said the White House
would not set an arbitrary timetable.
</P>
<P>
Obama _ who has captured national attention since giving the keynote address at
the Democratic National Convention last year _ declined to provide specific
troop reduction numbers but said the administration and military need to provide
a timeframe for the phased withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi people like the American people are recognizing that a phased
withdrawal is appropriate and that there should be some timeframe around that.
It doesn't have to be a date certain that suddenly ... all troops are pulled
out, but there has to be a game plan by which the Iraqis take more
responsibility for their own security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. lawmaker also joined the chorus of politicians defending decorated
Vietnam War veteran Rep. John Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat, who was
criticized by the Bush administration and other Republicans after calling for an
immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
"We watched the shameful attempt to paint John Murtha _ a Marine Corp recipient
of two purple hearts and a Bronze Star _ into a coward of questionable
patriotism," Obama said.
</P>
<P>
The administration has since toned down its criticism of Murtha with Bush over
the weekend calling him "a fine man" and longtime supporter of the
military.
</P>
<P>
Obama said Americans want to find solutions to the "difficult and complicated
situation in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"The President could take the politics out of Iraq once and for all if he would
simply go on television and say to the American people 'Yes, we made mistakes.
Yes, there are things I would have done differently. But now that we're here, I
am willing to work with both Republicans and Democrats to find the most
responsible way out,'" Obama said.

U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, an Illinois Democrat, met Tuesday with Israeli Foreign
Minister Silvan Shalom and said that the United States stood by Israel as its
leader, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, lay unconscious in a hospital bed following
a massive stroke.
</P>
<P>
Obama, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke to reporters
after a meeting with Shalom, on the latest leg of a 10-day tour of the Middle
East that included visits to Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan and the Palestinian
territories.

<P>
"Obviously we are here at a difficult time," he said. "Our hearts go out to the
family of Prime Minister Sharon and we are praying for a recovery on his part
and I think the entire world is watching because we recognize that his presence
here in the entire process was absolutely important and constructive."
</P>
<P>
Obama said he was visiting the region to learn more than tell leaders his
opinion.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has to figure out what the next steps are, if in fact Prime Minister
Sharon does not recover in a way that allows him to move into the government,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Obama said he was encouraged about the "growing consensus around a principle of
moving peace forward if there is a responsible partner on the other side," and
was looking forward to the results of the Palestinians' Jan. 25 elections and
their aftermath.
</P>
<P>
"Violence is not the answer to the long-standing problems that exist in this
area and my hope is that U.S. policy will continue to encourage the nonviolent
mediation of these issues," he said.

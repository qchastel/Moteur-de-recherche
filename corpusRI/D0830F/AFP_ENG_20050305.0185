<P>
It took 20 years for Sue 
Swartzendruber to become truly frightened by the murder of her 
next-door neighbor, Marine Hedge.
</P>
<P>
At the time of Hedges murder in 1985, Swartzendruber said police 
and family members believed her death may have been the result of a 
domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
Rumors that the notorious Kansas serial killer known as "BTK" -- 
the initials for "bind, torture, kill" -- may have been responsible 
remained just that.
</P>
<P>
That is, until police announced the arrest last week of 
59-year-old Dennis Rader, a man who had been Swartzendruber's 
neighbor too.
</P>
<P>
Swartzendruber, 57, moved here several years after the first 
wave of gruesome killings by BTK terrorized this midwestern US 
town.
</P>
<P>
"I never felt threatened," Swartzendruber, a telephone company 
worker, told AFP over lunch at a Wichita restaurant. "Not until 20 
years later when I realized what could have happened if hed knocked 
on my door instead of hers."
</P>
<P>
There were no signs of a forced entry into Hedge's home. The 
killer took her car and it was eight days before her naked body was 
found dumped on a dirt road.
</P>
<P>
"All these years I figured wed never find out what happened to 
her," Swartzendruber said.
</P>
<P>
In the days following Raders arrest, Swartzendruber has been 
remembering all those nights when she was alone in the house while 
her teenage children were visiting their grandparents.
</P>
<P>
Nights where she might have answered a friendly knock from thhought highly of the dog catcher rumored to 
take an active interest in sending stray dogs to be euthanized, she 
never imagined he could have been BTK.
</P>
<P>
"Its shocking as all is what it is," she said.
</P>
<P>
BTK first struck in January 1974, murdering four members of the 
Otero family, a married couple and their 11-year-old daughter and 
nine-year-old son. The children were strangled.
</P>
<P>
After police arrested a suspect, BTK began taunting the 
authorities, bragging in the first of a series of letters to them 
that he had acted alone.
</P>
<P>
The letter, full of spelling mistakes, was concealed in a book 
at a local Wichita library. The killer called the local newspaper, 
the Wichita Eagle, to tell reporters where to find it.
</P>
<P>
BTK killed twice more in 1977. It was years before he was linked 
to a seventh victim in 1986, although there has been rampant 
speculation for years amongst locals that he may have killed more.
</P>
<P>
Police have said the current tally of 10 victims may be 
increased during the course of the post-arrest investigation.
</P>
<P>
During the height of BTKs killing spree, Rader worked at an ADT 
Security Services branch office in Wichita in positions that allowed 
him access to customers homes.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his arrest, Radar worked as a city ordinance enforcer 
in Park City. A Cub Scout leader who was active in his local church, 
Rader is married with two children.

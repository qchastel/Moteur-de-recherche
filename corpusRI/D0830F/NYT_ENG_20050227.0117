RELIEF, AND BEWILDERMENT, OVER ARREST IN KANSAS KILLINGS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WICHITA, Kan.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those gathered inside Christ Lutheran Church on
Sunday morning, the lasting images of Dennis L. Rader were
simple, sweet moments. Just last Wednesday evening, for instance, he
had stopped by the church to drop off spaghetti sauce
and salad for a potluck dinner before he went to
visit his mother at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Even as Wichita voiced relief at the prospect that one of
the most notorious serial killers in recent history might finally
be behind bars, those who knew Rader, the man the
police have accused of being the city's "BTK" killer, said
they were beginning to experience new waves of bewilderment, confusion,
betrayal and fear.
</P>
<P>
Michael G. Clark, the pastor at Christ Lutheran, where Rader, his
wife, his mother and his in-laws have been members for
30 years and where Rader began his elected term as
president of the church council in January, said he was
having difficulty grasping the possibility that the man the police
arrested on Friday was the same one he knew so
well.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the congregation wept during services Sunday, and crisis
counselors arrived at the church by the afternoon. Rader's wife,
Paula, was in seclusion, the pastor said, in "a state
of disbelief."
</P>
<P>
BTK, as the killer had dubbed himself in one of his
rambling writings years ago, stood for bind, torture, kill.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the authorities here said that Rader, 59, had been
booked into Sedgwick County's jail, where he was being held
on a $10 million probable cause bond on suspicion of
10 first-degree murders, dating from 1974 until 1991. Prosecutors here
will probably file formal charges against him this week, Georgia
Cole, a spokeswoman for the Sedgwick County district attorney's office,
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While the arrest, residents here said, may have answered some of
their biggest questions about the killer they had been wondering
and worrying about for more than a generation, it also
set off a new set of questions, small and large.
</P>
<P>
In a weekend news conference, law enforcement officials revealed almost nothing
about why they focused on Rader and what evidence they
might have against him. In the information void, rumors and
questions filled Wichita's airwaves and Internet chat rooms on Sunday:
How had the police found him now, after so many
years of looking? Why had Park City's public library been
suddenly shut down on Friday during Rader's arrest? Who had
supplied Rader's DNA sample that, according to comments by Gov.
Kathleen Sebelius, allowed the authorities to link him to the
crime scenes?

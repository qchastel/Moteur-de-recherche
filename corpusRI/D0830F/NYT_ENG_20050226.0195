WICHITA, Kan. -- People here had often wondered and worried about
whether BTK, the elusive serial killer who taunted this city
on and off for more than three decades, might be
living right here, just beside them, all along.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, as the authorities announced an arrest in one of
the most notorious, puzzling string of crimes in recent history,
they confirmed exactly what people in the Wichita area had
feared: The man the police had arrested was a longtime
neighbor, a leader at one of their churches, a father
with a wife and two children, who had once, neighbors
said, led a scouting troop for boys.
</P>
<P>
He was the suburban municipal employee who checked in to see
that their dog was on a leash, their garbage can
was tucked away, their grass was trimmed just so.
</P>
<P>
Inside a City Hall chamber packed with the families of victims,
scores of police officers, some retired and gray now, and
a long line of political leaders from the state, the
police announced that they had arrested Dennis L. Rader, 59,
of suburban Park City, as the suspect in the case
of BTK, the name the killer had long ago selected
for himself for his preferred method: bind, torture, kill.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line: BTK is arrested," Chief Norman Williams of the
Wichita police said, setting off only one of what would
become multiple rounds of applause during the announcement that some
law enforcement officials in the room said they had waited
entire careers to hear.
</P>
<P>
The police said they pulled over Rader in his vehicle about
a block from his home, 10 minutes north of downtown
Wichita, just after noon on Friday. He was taken into
custody without fuss, the police said, and was being held
at an "undisclosed location" on Saturday. He is suspected, said
Lt. Ken Landwehr, who worked the BTK mystery for years,
in 10 killings -- two more than had been publicly
attributed to BTK before Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rader has not been charged, but officials said the district attorney's
office here would be asked to consider filing charges next
week.
</P>

For the families of the dead, the news marked an end
of sorts, but also a difficult reminder of their unalterable
losses and of how long they had waited. Ruth Fox,
the stepmother of Nancy Fox, who was bound and strangled
with a nylon stocking in 1977, said she had been
stricken by Rader's image. "When I saw his picture this
morning," she said, pausing for a long moment, "I just
wanted to choke him."
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense of closure," she added, "to a degree."

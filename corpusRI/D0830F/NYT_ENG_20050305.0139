<HEADLINE>
SUSPECT IN 10 MURDERS SEEMED A STICKLER FOR LIVING BY THE RULES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PARK CITY, Kan.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his crisp beige uniform, cap and
badge, Dennis L. Rader took his job upholding the most
mundane city laws with unusual earnestness.
</P>
<P>
He was often seen in his white truck, the words "Compliance
Officer, Park City" painted on the side, puttering along at
10 miles an hour, searching for overgrown lawns, overflowing trash
cans or dogs wandering past their fences.
</P>
<P>
"He looked for absolutely everything, and he must have enforced every
rule there ever was -- just because he could, I
guess," said Barbara Walters, 69, a retired auditor for the
IRS, who challenged a $25 ticket that Rader had issued
in August 1998, saying her dog, Shadow, was running loose.
</P>
<P>
Walters' lawyer said that Rader arrived for court more prepared than
some lawyers do for murder trials, bearing a lengthy file
on Shadow, a videotape of the dog and a complicated
system of notebook tabs linking the accusations to his evidence.
Rader, and his pile of paper, won.
</P>
<P>
But police say the man who was a stickler for the
slightest pet infraction in this modest suburb of Wichita had
also killed 10 people by then.
</P>
<P>
Investigators say that Rader, who will turn 60 on Wednesday, probably
in the solitary jail cell where he has been held
since last week, is one of the nation's most notorious
and elusive serial killers, the strangler who toyed with Wichita
for three decades in letters and poems and packages and
who long ago insisted that the public call him BTK,
for his preferred method: bind, torture, kill. Lawyers for Rader,
who has yet to enter a plea in the case,
did not return calls on Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most stunning for the Wichita area, where Rader has spent his
life, is not just that he was viewed as an
ordinary fellow, someone who blended right in at the Taco
Bell, but that he seemed to have stayed meticulously and
constantly within the strictest mores of society -- more so,
at times, than even many residents.
</P>
<P>
Rader and his wife of 34 years went to church each
Sunday. Sometimes when he left an after-work bar outing to
hurry home, his colleagues would privately breathe a sigh of
relief; with him gone, they could drink up and tell
off-color jokes. As far back as the eighth grade, Rader
had been picked for the prestigious school patrol, the selected
few who carried big red Stop signs and told classmates
and motorists when to go and when not to.
</P>
<P>
"The thing to remember is that we always thought in the
end that BTK would be a local, that he would
probably even be a functioning member of the community," said
Richard LaMunyon, who led the police department at the height
of the investigation years ago. "But I guess we never
dreamed he would be functioning quite to this degree --
a church leader, a Boy Scout leader, someone quite so
known, quite so public."
</P>
<P>
Many serial killers have led relatively successful lives, with steady jobs
and relationships, in contrast to their popular image as loners
and drifters. But experts on serial killings say that the
portrait of Rader takes that notion of stability, authority and
prominence in the community to a level rarely seen.
</P>
<P>
Here, in a city where a generation of police officers spent
their careers searching for BTK -- deconstructing his tangled, grisly
writings, studying dozens of psychological profiles and swabbing DNA from
the cheeks of 4,000 residents -- some older detectives have
now come to LaMunyon wondering whether they should have found
Rader, who was hardly hiding away, decades sooner. After all,
LaMunyon said, Rader's name should have appeared on at least
two broad lists of suspects in the 1970s, and he
had other tenuous ties to three of the 10 victims.
</P>
<P>
Born on March 9, 1945, Dennis Lynn Rader was the eldest
of four boys who grew up in a working-class neighborhood
in Wichita, a city of fewer than 170,000 at the
time. His father, Bill, who died in 1996 after retiring
as a plant operator at a Kansas utility company's generating
station, was strict with but never cruel, Rader's childhood friends
recalled.
</P>
<P>
"Raders are a little bit stubborn, but not mean," said Lee
Rader, 73, a first cousin of Bill Rader who lives
in Springfield, Mo. Like much of the extended family in
sturdy towns across the Midwest, Lee Rader said he could
not remember a time when Bill Rader's family had done
anything that might draw notice, much less cross the law.
"There is some divorces, I guess that's the worst thing
that's going," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rader's young life seemed uncomplicated and happily ordinary to Roger
Farthing, who grew up with him. Rader buried himself in
dime-store novels and comic books. He played games of cops
and robbers until dark. And he posed a question to
the teacher on the first day of the first grade,
a question few here let him forget: What time is
lunch?
</P>
<P>
Years later, Rader reminisced on that simpler time. In the "Riverview
Round-Up," a questionnaire for his grade-school reunion, he listed his
favorite memories in big block letters: recess, story times, last
days of school, snowball fights broken up by the principal,
art class, a nearby candy store, an old merry-go-round and,
of course, lunch hour. Asked in that questionnaire for any
"pearls of wisdom," Rader wrote: "Do it now. Life is
complicated and short so stay young at heart as long
as possible: It was so easy in '59."
</P>
<P>
After high school, Rader began attending Wichita State University but quickly
joined the Air Force, learning to repair wire and antennae
systems, and leaving Wichita for four years, the longest he
would ever be away. He returned in 1970, and settled
down with Paula Dietz, who had grown up here, too,
gone to the same high school, and lived just around
the corner from the squat house in Park City, where
they would soon have a boy, Brian, and a girl,
Kerri.
</P>
<P>
Rader worked for a year on an assembly line at the
Coleman Co., making heating and cooling units. Still, he had
no bachelor's degree, so he began studying again at Wichita
State in 1973, working toward a degree that would take
him six years to earn. His major: criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
THE KILLINGS BEGIN
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 15, 1974, BTK struck Wichita for the first time,
although most residents would not learn those initials or even
that a serial killer was on the loose for several
years.
</P>
<P>
The scene was ghastly, unlike anything this city had seen before.
Four members of the Otero family -- Joseph, 38, a
retired Air Force officer; Julie, 34, who had worked at
the Coleman Co. about a month before; and two of
their children, Josephine, 11, and Joseph II, 9 -- were
strangled inside their home in the middle of the day
with the cord used in Venetian blinds.
</P>
<P>
Left behind was a uniquely grisly scene, the details of which
would be echoed in the future killings over the years
that followed. The phone line had been cut. The Oteros
had been bound, and the police noted that the knots
were particularly elaborate. The killer had taken at least one
souvenir of the day: a watch.
</P>
<P>
None of the Oteros had been sexually assaulted, though Josephine's body
was found partly clothed, hanging from a sewer pipe in
the basement. Not far from the girl, there in the
basement, semen was found, as it would be in subsequent
killings. Investigators quickly believed they were searching for a sexual
deviant, someone who took pleasure in tying people up, watching
them gasp for air and die slowly. Some of the
victims' faces were left bloated, investigators said, suggesting that the
killer would strangle them, let them breathe, then strangle them
some more.
</P>
<P>
The Otero case would be the first and last known time
that BTK would kill a man or a child: The
rest of the victims were all women, seemingly picked at
random, with no firm connections between them, and in ages
ranging from 21 to 62 years old. Nine months later,
after the police announced a possible confession in the Otero
case, the killer's first letter appeared. It took credit for
the Otero deaths, mentioned details that the police said only
the killer would have known, and expressed frustration that someone
else might be trying to assume credit for the deaths.
The letter was riddled with typographical and spelling errors.
</P>
<P>
"I can't stop it so the monster goes on, and hurt
me as well as society," the letter said. He wrote
on of his complicated "game" of following victims, checking up
on them, and then "waiting in the dark, waiting, waiting."
</P>
<P>
The letter closed with a postscript: "The code words for me
will be Bind them, toture them, kill them, B.TK, you
see he at it again. They will be on the
next victim."
</P>
<P>
But by then the killer had already struck again. Kathryn Bright,
who also worked at Coleman, had been stabbed to death
inside her house in April. Her phone lines were snipped
and she was bound with a knotted cord.
</P>
<P>
IN THE SECURITY BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
Soon after Rader started a job at ADT, the security company,
at the end of 1974, he was widely disliked --
particularly by those beneath him when he became a supervisor
for the alarm installers.
</P>
<P>
"He was deeply competent, organized, and good at what he did,
but he was a task master," said Rick Carr, 68,
who sold systems for ADT. "He came in with the
attitude: You're here to get the job done and I'm
not here to be someone's pal."
</P>
<P>
Rader worked for 14 years in what others called "the dungeon,"
the section of the office with no windows and gray
walls. But his job also sent him out of the
office during the day, to sign off on installations.
</P>
<P>
At company swimming pool parties at the Carrs' Wichita home, Martha
Carr, Rick Carr's ex-wife, said Rader always arrived cheerily with
his wife and children, looked you right in the eye
and said all the right things: that the party was
lovely, the food was nicely arranged.
</P>
<P>
Paula Rader, meanwhile, was a fabulous cook and a quiet, sweet
woman, Martha Carr said. "She seemed innocent -- not worldly,
you know?"
</P>
<P>
One regular topic of discussion at ADT, not surprisingly, was BTK.
</P>
<P>
"It was the conversation all over town, but this was a
security company, and let's face it -- BTK increased our
business," said Denise Mattocks, 46, who worked alongside Rader for
years and said she respected, liked and trusted him. Whatever
dislike there was of him, she said, stemmed from his
exceptional standards -- and from his employees' tendency to cut
corners on the job.
</P>
<P>
Mattocks, who was single, was particularly fearful of BTK, she said,
and told Rader so regularly. Like so many in Wichita
as the panic grew, she spoke of checking her telephone
for a dial tone every time she got home and
of the shortage of deadbolt locks at hardware stores around
town in those years. Rader, she recalled, said little in
response. If anything, his efforts at conversation leaned more to
his life at home: his wife, the tomatoes in his
garden, his Boy Scout outings.
</P>
<P>
Rader became a Scout leader when his son, Brian, was about
8 and could join Pack 491. Rader held the boys
to strict standards, not letting them slide by, as some
fathers did, without perfecting skills for a badge, said George
J. Martin, 70, who helped lead the pack. Rader was
particularly capable, Martin said, when it came to the knots
the boys had to learn.
</P>
<P>
"The sheep shank, the bowline, the half hitch, the monkey fist,"
he remembered, "Dennis knew them all. He learned them when
he was a Scout himself."
</P>
<P>
THE LETTERS STOP
</P>
<P>
By the late 1970s, BTK had killed seven people, police say,
and the eerie, taunting letters kept arriving. One letter was
traced to a copying machine at Wichita State University. In
1979, after BTK apparently broke into a home and waited
-- without success -- for its occupant to come home,
he sent an explicit poem for the woman who never
arrived: "Oh, Anna Why Didn't You Appear."
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the woman, 63 and a widow, had been his eighth
target.
</P>
<P>
In part, the poem read: "Alone again I trod in pass
memory of mirrors, and ponder why fornumber eight was not."
And then the letters suddenly stopped.
</P>
<P>
What did not stop, police say now, were the killings. BTK
killed more women in 1985, 1986 and 1991 -- including
two cases that had not been linked to BTK publicly
until last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Some people, like Al Thimmesch, a retired Wichita police officer, wonder
whether still more deaths have yet to be identified as
the work of BTK. But if the police are right,
the serial killings ended on Jan. 19, 1991, with the
death of Delores Davis, whose house is near Park City.
</P>
<P>
In May 1991, Rader was hired as Park City's compliance officer,
a period one resident of this suburb calls the start
of the "reign of terror" for homeowners here.
</P>
<P>
Rader's critics here say he seemed to sit in his truck,
just waiting for something to go wrong. He took numerous
photos of their homes, they said, in search of something
awry. Some people even insist that he sometimes let their
dogs out himself, then cited them.
</P>
<P>
Rhonda Reno said she watched one day as Rader wandered on
the lawn of a neighbor who was ill. Rader walked
the grass with a yardstick, she said, measuring for any
infraction. "I never trusted him," said Jim Reno, her husband.
"There were two people I keep an eye on in
this block, and one was him."
</P>
<P>
Still, others here liked Rader, and found his outsized enthusiasm for
his inspection work charming.
</P>
<P>
He helped an elderly resident trap skunks, and helped his neighbor,
a single woman, by mowing her lawn and fixing her
leaky faucets, she said. And even he could bend the
rules, when he wanted. Virginia Jackson, 53, recalled the day
when her boxer got loose. Rader, she said, chased down
the dog in his truck and after a long struggle,
managed to bring it home. Jackson never got a ticket.
</P>
<P>
"He was very professional," she said. "He was doing his job."
</P>
<P>
BREAKING HIS SILENCE
</P>
<P>
Last January, The Wichita Eagle published an article about BTK, to
mark the 30th anniversary of the Otero killings and the
start of the panic. By then, the case had been
forgotten by many. The youngest people here had never heard
of the serial killer. In the heart of the article,
the suggestion was made that BTK might have moved away
or even died.
</P>
<P>
Two months later, BTK wrote a letter, his first in a
quarter century. From there, he embarked on a frenzy of
mailings -- 11 of them. He filled these, too, with
trinkets, some apparently from the killings: an identification card, photographs,
a word puzzle, a doll with a plastic bag over
its head, a necklace, a computer disk and a victim's
driver's license.
</P>
<P>
By last weekend, with help from the computer disk and DNA
evidence, the police announced that BTK had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Looking back, some people wonder if the Wichita police could have
made an arrest sooner. LaMunyon, the former police chief, tells
those who ask that he does not believe an arrest
was possible over all those years; the BTK's newest mailings,
many of which contained a mellower, more conciliatory tone than
years before, created a whole new room full of evidence
for investigators to go on.
</P>
<P>
Still, he acknowledged that Rader's name probably was included on two
long lists drawn up by the police years ago. The
police had gathered the names of Coleman employees, at one
point, since the first two women killed had worked there,
as had, it turned out, Rader. They had also collected
the names of white men at Wichita State in the
mid- and late 1970s because they knew that one of
BTK's letters had been copied on campus and that a
poem sent by BTK was thought to resemble a song
taught in a popular professor's folklore class at Wichita State.
</P>
<P>
There was another link, too. Although the police had not publicly
connected the death of Marine Hedge, the eighth victim, to
BTK until last weekend, at the time of her death,
Hedge lived six houses down the street from Rader's home
in Park City.
</P>
<P>
"I think the police made a mistake over the years," said
Robert Beattie, who is finishing a book about BTK. "They
were looking for a Charles Manson type." Charles Liles, a
former Wichita police officer, said the police focused too narrowly
on convicted sex offenders rather than someone who might live
right among them.
</P>
<P>
Michael G. Clark, Rader's pastor, visited him in jail on Wednesday.
Rader is "doing as well as can be expected," Clark
said. Clark's own disbelief, though, has not worn off. The
more he reflects, Clark said, the more he remembers only
ordinary conversations with Rader.
</P>
<P>
"That's what I've realized," Clark said. "There is nothing to remember,
nothing that would make it all make sense."
</P>
<P>
Park City, meanwhile, fired Rader, saying only that he had missed
work.

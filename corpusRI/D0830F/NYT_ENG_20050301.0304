COMPUTER DISK LED TO BTK ARREST, PASTOR SAYS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WICHITA, Kan.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the end, the BTK serial killer's downfall
may have been his own love of sending letters, poems
and packages out to the world.
</P>
<P>
Michael G. Clark, the pastor of Dennis L. Rader, the man
charged with 10 counts of murder in the strangulation deaths
that terrorized a city, said Tuesday that one item in
the killer's most recent mailing to a local television station
was what helped finally crack the case: an ordinary computer
disk.
</P>
<P>
The police here have refused to say what led them to
arrest Rader, a city codes enforcer and a church leader,
31 years after the first killings in Wichita, but they
have acknowledged that the BTK serial killer's peculiar and persistent
communications with the public, particularly in recent months, worked to
their advantage in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Clark said that police told him they used information on the
computer disk in BTK's final mailing, on Feb. 16, to
trace the disk back to a computer at Christ Lutheran
Church, where Clark is the pastor. Rader, the church council's
president, had used the church's computer a few weeks earlier,
Clark said, to print the agenda for a church council
meeting he was to preside over.
</P>
<P>
Rader, 59, appeared before a judge for the first time on
Tuesday, listening while 10 charges of first-degree murder were read
aloud via videoconference from the county jail.
</P>
<P>
When the killings began here in 1974, so did BTK's writings.
He sent them to television stations, left them in libraries,
mailed them to the local newspaper. Then, just as suddenly
as the letters had begun, they stopped in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The silence lasted 25 years -- until March, when the first
of 11 more packages and letters began arriving. The last
mailing arrived Feb. 16 at a television station, and contained
a lilac-colored computer disk.
</P>
<P>
Experts said old files that seem to be erased might actually
still be accessible on such a disk, or the disk
might preserve an IP address particular to an individual computer
that is linked to the Internet.

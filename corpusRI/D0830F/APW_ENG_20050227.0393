BTK suspect hid for decades around city he allegedly terrorized
</HEADLINE>

PARK CITY, Kansas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dennis Rader, the man police believe is the BTK serial killer, hid for more than
30 years in plain sight.
</P>
<P>
He lived in this suburb of Wichita, the city he is suspected of terrorizing,
with a wife and two children. He led a Cub Scout troop and was active in his
Lutheran church. As an ordinance enforcement officer for the local government,
he could be seen measuring grass in a front yard with a tape measure to see if
it was too long, a neighbor said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, police identified Rader as a suspect in the BTK killings and
announced an end to their 31-year manhunt. Although no charges have been filed,
a jubilant collection of law enforcers and community leaders told a cheering
crowd they were confident the long-running case could now be
closed.
</P>
<P>
Officials also said they connected two more deaths to BTK _ a self-coined
nickname that stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill" _ bringing his total to at least
10.
</P>
<P>
BTK stoked fears throughout the 1970s in Wichita, a manufacturing center with
350,000 residents, with his grisly crimes and letters sent to police and
media.
</P>
<P>
The killer stopped writing in the late 1970s but resurfaced about a year ago
with a letter giving details of a 1986 slaying that had not previously linked to
BTK.
</P>
<P>
In Park City, the suspect's neighbors said he helped elderly neighbors with yard
work but described him as an unpleasant man who often went looking for reasons
to cite his neighbors for violations of city codes.
</P>
<P>
Bill Lindsay, 38, lived behind Rader and said his wife caught Rader in their
adjoining backyards filming the back of their house.
</P>
<P>
"He really acted really funny," said Lindsay, a truck driver. "I'd be on the
road and my wife would tell me, 'Dennis has been out again, taking his
pictures.'"
</P>
<P>
Jason Day, 28, said his brother was in Rader's Cub Scout pack at the nearby Park
City Baptist Church, but their mother pulled him out because of
Rader.
</P>
<P>
"It was his demeanor," he said. "He was so strange."
</P>
<P>
Messages left for Rader's family members were not returned on Saturday, and no
one answered the door at the home of his in-laws.
</P>
<P>
Rader was being held at an undisclosed location, and it was not immediately
clear if he had a lawyer. In Kansas, suspects generally appear before a judge
for a status hearing within 48 hours of their arrest.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Nola Foulston said the death penalty would not apply to any crime
committed between 1972 and 1994, when Kansas did not have the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
The BTK slayings began in 1974 with the strangulations of Joseph Otero, 38, his
wife, Julie, 34, and their two children. The six victims that followed were all
women, and most were strangled.
</P>
<P>
Along with his grisly crimes, the killer terrorized Wichita by sending rambling
letters to the media, including one in which he named himself BTK for "Bind
them, Torture them, Kill them." In another he complained, "How many do I have to
kill before I get my name in the paper or some national attention?"
</P>
<P>
In several of the letters, BTK included clues to his identity. Police had long
believed BTK was a graduate of Wichita State University, as Rader was. Letters
sent in the past year included jewelry that police believed may have been taken
from BTK's victims and the driver's license of one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
"He obviously was getting rid of his trophies; he was leaving us a wide-open
trail," said Richard LaMunyon, Wichita's police chief from 1963 to 1989. "I
think the ultimate goal was of him being caught."
</P>
<P>
At one point, investigators made a list of white men who graduated from Wichita
State in the 1970s. Officials said Rader's name likely was on that list, but he
wasn't identified back then as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
BTK stopped communicating in 1979 and remained silent for more than two decades
before re-establishing contact last March with a letter to The Wichita Eagle
about an unsolved 1986 killing.
</P>
<P>
The letter included a copy of the victim's driver's license and photos of her
slain body. The return address on the letter said it was from Bill Thomas
Killman _ initials BTK.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tips poured in, and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation gathered
thousands of DNA swabs in connection with the investigation. In the end, DNA
evidence was the key to cracking the case, said Kansas Gov. Kathleen
Sebelius.
</P>
<P>
"The way they made the link was some DNA evidence, that they had some DNA
connection to the guy who they arrested," Sebelius said in an interview with The
Associated Press. She did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The two newly identified cases were similar to the early ones with one
exception, Sedgwick County Sheriff Gary Steed said: The bodies had been removed
from the crime scenes. One of the victims lived on the same street as
Rader.
</P>
<P>
"We as investigators keep an open mind. But only now are we able to bring them
together as BTK cases," he said.

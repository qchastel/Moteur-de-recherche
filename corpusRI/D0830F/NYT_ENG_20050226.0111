Wichita police announce arrest of suspect in BTK case

WICHITA -- With six terse words Saturday, Police Chief Norman Williams
unveiled what he hopes will be the solution to a
mystery that has stymied authorities and gripped a community for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line: BTK is arrested," Williams said.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rader, 59, of Park City, Kan., a Wichita suburb, was
arrested without incident during a traffic stop Friday afternoon. Although
Rader has yet to be charged with any crime, authorities
said Saturday they are confident the arrest will end the
search for BTK, the serial killer who police now believe
murdered 10 people between 1974 and 1991 and taunted authorities
for their inability to catch him.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came shortly after 10 a.m. Saturday at a decidedly
upbeat and celebratory press conference before a capacity crowd at
the City Council chambers. The press conference included numerous federal,
state and local law enforcement officials, prosecutors and dozens of
victims' family members.
</P>
<P>
Authorities released little information at the press conference concerning Rader's arrest
and their investigation.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be discussing this case publicly," said Sedgwick County
District Attorney Nola Foulston.
</P>
<P>
Authorities allege BTK, the macabre name the killer gave himself for
his preferred method of homicide -- Bind, Torture, Kill --
is linked to 10 murders. Originally investigators assumed only eight
murders were the work of the serial killer, but on
Saturday they announced two others, both in Park City.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tips poured in, and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation
conducted hundreds of DNA swabs in connection with the BTK
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Investigators won't release details of what led to Rader's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Williams later denied that anyone with the police department
called Wichita Mayor Carlos Mayans about the DNA test.
</P>
<P>
Authorities wouldn't say where Rader, a Cub Scout leader who was
active at his Lutheran church, is being held. It was
unclear whether Rader, who worked as a municipal codes enforcement
supervisor in Park City, has an attorney yet.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said evidence will likely be presented to prosecutors this week,
and that they would expect 10 murder charges to be
filed.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the front rows at the press conference were the
families of victims, some of whom have waited decades for
an arrest.
</P>
<P>
Charles Bright's daughter Kathryn Bright was 21 when she was stabbed
to death in 1974. BTK was waiting for her when
she and her brother Kevin had returned to her home.
Kevin Bright was shot twice, but survived and managed to
escape.
</P>
<P>
When Charles Bright heard Friday that a BTK suspect was in
custody, "I was elated," he said. He said he had
doubts his daughter's murderer would ever be caught.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the arrest signified, Bright's wife Kay Bright had one
word. "Closure."
</P>
<P>
BTK's crimes are not eligible for the death penalty, because the
murders occurred at times when the state had no capital
punishment. Some of BTK's lesser crimes--home invasion, tampering with phone
lines and restraint--cannot be prosecuted because the statute of limitations
on those crimes has expired.
</P>
<P>
But, as Foulston pointed out, "there is no statute of limitations
on the crime of homicide."
</P>
<P>
The BTK task force included local and county police, the Kansas
Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and others.
At Saturday's announcement, investigators thanked scores of agencies and individual
investigators. Investigators said their work slogged on despite the glare
of intense public scrutiny and critics who questioned their methods.
"We knew that we had to get to this day,"
Chief Williams said. "...Doggone it, we did it."
</P>
<P>
In the year since BTK re-emerged and once again dominated the
local headlines, sales of home alarms doubled.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, residents said they had become wearied by the search
for a serial killer who lived among them. As Williams
said, residents wondered, "Is BTK my next door neighbor?"
</P>
<P>
In the trial that investigators say is sure to come, details
of the 31-year mystery may finally come to light.
</P>
<P>
"You will come face to face with evil, and the horrific
knowledge of what this evil did," Attorney General Phill Kline
said at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Kline was one of several speakers at the press conference, including
U.S. Rep. Todd Tiahrt, city and state officials and representatives
of several law enforcement agencies. Before the press conference, dozens
of victims' family members were brought in small groups before
a gauntlet of television cameras. Some family shielded their faces
from the media. The families were followed by grim-faced investigators.
Outside, curious Wichita residents discussed what they hoped was the
final chapter in the 31-year-old mystery.
</P>
<P>
Kim Sloan, 35, a Wichita, got to City Hall at 8
a.m. The homemaker is part of the "Catch BTK" online
discussion board and website. On Saturday she wore a "Catch
BTK" button and admitted that she and a friend tried
to find Rader's home at 4 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to know what makes him tick," she said.
</P>
<P>
Tom Andrews, 46, was in junior high when BTK claimed his
first victims. On Saturday, Andrews was at City Hall to
take photos of the scene.
</P>
<P>
Andrews said his family and friends have speculated about BTK for
years. "He's like our Boston Strangler," Andrews said. "This is
kind of a once-in-a-lifetime event," he said. "At least you
hope it is."

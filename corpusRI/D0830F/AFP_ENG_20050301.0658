WICHITA, Kansas, March 1
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 59-year-old former home 
security company worker accused of being the notorious "BTK" serial 
killer was charged here on Tuesday with 10 counts of murder in 
connection with a case which baffled Kansas police for three 
decades.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rader, 59, answered "yes, sir" when asked by district 
court Judge Gregory Waller if he understood the 10 charges of 
first-degree murder against him. Bail was put at 10 million dollars 
and his next court appearance set for March 15.
</P>
<P>
Balding, sporting a moustache and eye-glasses and dressed in a 
bright red prison jumpsuit, Rader appeared before the judge from a 
detention cell by video link. He was flanked by a public defender, 
Richard Ney.
</P>
<P>
It was Rader's first court appearance since he was arrested on 
Friday on suspicion of being the killer known by the initials BTK, 
which stand for "Bind, Torture, Kill" the grisly method employed by 
the murderer who terrorized the Wichita area for years.
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick County district attorney Nola Foulston offered few 
details about the case when speaking to reporters following Raders 
brief appearance.
</P>
<P>
"It is not our prerogative to try this case on the courthouse 
steps," she told reporters. "These are allegations against an 
individual that must be proven in a court of this jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
Foulston admonished the media for reporting false rumors about 
the case. She declined to comment on reports Rader had confessed and 
insisted that no further information would be provided by her office 
until the March 15 preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
Authorities reopened their investigation in March 2004 after the 
killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local 
television station and sent a package containing the driver's 
license of a 25-year-old woman killed in December 1977.
</P>
<P>
A Cub Scout leader, devout churchgoer and married father of two, 
Rader was a respected member of the local community before his 
arrest.
</P>
<P>
During the height of BTK's killing spree Rader worked at an ADT 
Security Services branch office in Wichita in positions that allowed 
him access to customer's homes. Prior to his arrest, he worked as a 
city ordinance enforcer in Park City, a suburb of Wichita.
</P>
<P>
Rader is alleged to have murdered at least 10 people between 
1974 and 1991. Seven of the victims were killed between 1974 and 
1977.
</P>
<P>
The BTK killer first struck in January 1974, murdering a married 
couple, Joseph and Julie Otero, their 11-year-old daughter and 
nine-year-old son. Both of the children were strangled.
</P>
<P>
After police arrested a suspect, BTK began taunting the 
authorities, bragging in the first of a series of letters that he 
had acted alone.
</P>
<P>
The letter, full of spelling mistakes, was concealed in a book 
at the local Wichita library. The killer called the local newspaper, 
the Wichita Eagle, to tell reporters where to find it.
</P>
<P>
Besides the murders of the Otero family, Rader was charged on 
Tuesday with killing six women. One of murders occurred in 1974, two 
in 1977 and one each in 1985, 1986 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
Rader will not be eligible for the death penalty because the 
murders occurred before this midwestern state reintroduced capital 
punishment in 1994.

<P>
Police have arrested the alleged 
serial killer suspected of at least seven brutal slayings in Kansas 
starting in the 1970s, Kansas authorities announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they had arrested 59-year-old Dennis Rader, a 
citizen of Park City, Kansas, on Friday, after police pulled the man 
over in his vehicle during a "routine" stop.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line: BTK is arrested," said Wichita police chief 
Norman Williams, describing the investigation as "the most intense 
and challenging" of his department's entire history.
</P>
<P>
"He is being held in an undisclosed location," Lieutenant Ken 
Landwehr said of the suspect, adding: "We will be approaching the 
district attorney's office next week ... to see if charges will be 
filed against this individual."
</P>
<P>
The Kansas serial killer -- who once referred to himself as 
"BTK," for "bind, torture, kill" -- is accused of murdering four 
women, two children and one man between 1974 and 1977.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, 
who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television 
station. Among the information he gave at that time was an admission 
that he had killed another woman in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Police said Saturday that they were investigating the man's 
involvement in nine killings, including that April 1985 murder and 
one more killing in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on 
Saturday. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a 
moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the 
victims.
</P>
<P>
A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was 
analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match.
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during 
Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still 
ongoing.
</P>
<P>
However, she said the files would be sealed once the 
investigation was closed, to ensure it remained as "pristine" as 
possible for court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Foulston said the accused man will not be eligible for the death 
penalty because the murders occurred before Kansas reintroduced 
capital punishment in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The killer first struck in January 1974, murdering four members 
of the Otero family, a married couple and their 11-year-old daughter 
and nine-year-old son. Both children were strangled.
</P>
<P>
BTK began taunting police, bragging in the first of a series of 
letters to them that he had acted alone, after they arrested a 
suspect.
</P>
<P>
The letter, full of spelling mistakes, was concealed in a book 
at the local Wichita library. The killer called the local newspaper, 
the Witchita Eagle, to tell reporters where to find it.
</P>
<P>
The suspect went on to murder three more women, all in their 
20s.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a 
statement revealing that authorities -- who had re-established 
communication with the killer after he began to contact the media in 
March 2004 -- had confirmed two letters that had been received as 
authentically coming from BTK.
</P>
<P>
One of them was a package containing the driver's license of 
Nancy Fox, a 25-year-old woman killed in December 1977, two years 
before the killer went silent.
</P>
<P>
Wichita authorities attending Saturday's news conference 
appeared overjoyed to have made an arrest. Wichita Mayor Carlos 
Mayans thanked the families of victims present at the gathering and 
told them that after three decades of waiting for an answer, "It's 
your day."
</P>
<P>
Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline said: "The full story of 
this investigation cannot be made known now to protect the integrity 
of the judicial process," but he added that "the full story really 
will never be known."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that during the trial it would become evident 
how "in a matter of only 11 months" investigators "were able to 
solve heyria

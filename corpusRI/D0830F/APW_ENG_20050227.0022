Wichita police say BTK serial killer has been arrested after 31 years of cat-and-mouse

<P>
A 31-year manhunt for a serial killer who taunted police with letters about his
crimes ended when authorities said they finally caught up with the man who
called himself BTK and linked him to at least 10 murders.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line: BTK is arrested," Wichita Police Chief Norman Williams said
Saturday, setting off applause from a crowd that included family members of some
of the victims.
</P>
<P>
The suspect was identified as Dennis L. Rader, a 59-year-old city worker in
nearby Park City, who was arrested Friday. Police did not say how they
identified Rader as a suspect or whether he has said anything since his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
BTK _ a self-coined nickname that stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill" _ stoked
fears throughout the 1970s in Wichita, a manufacturing center with 350,000
residents, about 180 miles (290 kilometers) southwest of Kansas City,
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
Then the killer resurfaced about a year ago after 25 years of silence. He had
been linked to eight slayings between 1974 and 1986, but police said Saturday
they had identified two more, from 1985 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
Rader, a Cub Scout leader who was active at his Lutheran church, lived with his
wife, neighbors said. Public records indicate they have two grown children.
Messages left for family members were not returned on Saturday, and no one
answered the door at the home of his in-laws.
</P>
<P>
A few neighbors recalled receiving small favors from Rader, but most interviewed
Saturday said the municipal codes enforcement supervisor was an unpleasant man
who often went looking for reasons to cite his neighbors for violations of city
codes.
</P>
<P>
"A part of me was scared when I heard, because I talked to him. It's a little
creepy," said Chris Yoder, 23, who once lived nearby.
</P>
<P>
Rader has yet to be charged, but a jubilant collection of law enforcers and
community leaders told the crowd in City Council chambers they were confident
the long-running case could now be closed.
</P>
<P>
Rader was being held at an undisclosed location, and it was not immediately
clear if he had a lawyer. In Kansas, suspects generally appear before a judge
for a status hearing within 48 hours of their arrest.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Nola Foulston said the death penalty would not apply to any crime
committed before 1994, when the death penalty was introduced in
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
The BTK slayings began in 1974 with the strangulations of Joseph Otero, 38, his
wife, Julie, 34, and their two children. The six victims that followed were all
women, and most were strangled.
</P>
<P>
Along with his grisly crimes, the killer terrorized Wichita by sending rambling
letters to the media, including one in which he named himself BTK for "Bind
them, Torture them, Kill them." In another he complained, "How many do I have to
kill before I get my name in the paper or some national attention?"
</P>
<P>
But he stopped communicating in 1979 and remained silent for more than two
decades before re-establishing contact last March with a letter to a newspaper
about an unsolved 1986 killing.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the killer had sent at least eight letters to the media or police,
including three packages containing jewelry that police believed may have been
taken from BTK's victims. One letter contained the driver's license of victim
Nancy Fox.
</P>
<P>
The new letters sent chills through Wichita but also rekindled hope that modern
forensic science could find some clue that would finally lead police to the
killer.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tips poured in, and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation gathered
thousands of DNA swabs in connection with the BTK investigation. In the end, DNA
evidence was the key to cracking the case, said Kansas Gov. Kathleen
Sebelius.
</P>
<P>
"The way they made the link was some DNA evidence, that they had some DNA
connection to the guy who they arrested," Sebelius said in an interview with The
Associated Press. She did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Authorities, who generally declined to answer questions in detail after
announcing the arrest, had little to say about why BTK resurfaced after years
without contact.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible something in his life has changed. I think he felt the need to
get his story out," said Richard LaMunyon, Wichita's police chief from 1963 to
1989.

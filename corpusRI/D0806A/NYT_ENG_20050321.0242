U.S. COURT BEGINS CONSIDERING FATE OF TERRI SCHIAVO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TAMPA, Fla.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fate of Terri Schiavo landed in federal
court Monday, as a judge here struggled to weigh the
complex facts and assertions amid pleas from Schiavo's parents to
act to resume her feeding before time ran out.
</P>
<P>
After two hours of tense and often emotional arguments, Judge James
D. Whittemore of U.S. District Court refused to rule immediately
on whether to restore nutrition to Schiavo, a severely brain-damaged
woman whose husband won a state court's permission to remove
her feeding tube last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Whittemore also expressed doubts about whether a federal review could change
the ultimate outcome and seemed skeptical of the parents' contention
that the state courts had violated Schiavo's right to due
process.
</P>
<P>
The delay disappointed Schiavo's parents and others who have asked the
federal court to swiftly order the tube reinserted and halt
Schiavo's demise.
</P>
<P>
Whittemore, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1999, was
randomly selected by computer to preside over the case after
Congress passed an extraordinary law early Monday morning allowing Schiavo's
parents to seek a federal court review of the facts.
</P>
<P>
While their lawyer said that Schiavo, who had already gone more
than three days without food or water, "may expire as
I speak," Whittemore appeared to be taking the calculated risk
that she would survive while he deliberated.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have said that Schiavo, 41, could live up to two
weeks without the feeding tube.
</P>
<P>
The hearing on Monday was the result of a determined effort
by the Republican leadership in Congress to override a series
of state court rulings that sided with Schiavo's husband, Michael.
</P>
<P>
President Bush returned to the White House from his vacation in
Texas solely to sign the law. He later praised Congress
for "voting to give Terry Schiavo's parents another opportunity to
save their daughter's life."
</P>
<P>
During the hearing in Tampa, the chief lawyer for Schiavo's parents,
Robert and Mary Schindler, told Whittemore that Schiavo's due process
rights had been violated because she had not had independent
legal representation during the seven years the case was in
state courts. The lawyer, David Gibbs, also said Schiavo's religious
beliefs as a Roman Catholic were being infringed because Pope
John Paul II has deemed it unacceptable for Catholics to
refuse food and water.
</P>
<P>
"We are now in a position where a court has ordered
her to disobey her church and even jeopardize her eternal
soul," Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
George Felos, who represents Michael Schiavo, who is also her guardian,
said reinserting the feeding tube would "countenance a severe invasion
upon the body of Terri Schiavo" and he asked the
judge to declare that the law passed by Congress was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Whittemore frequently sighed, paused and buried his face in his hands
during the hearing. He wanted details of how long it
would take to move Schiavo from her hospice to a
nearby hospital and replace the tube -- about two hours,
the lawyers said -- and what the procedure involved. Each
side said it would require surgery and that Schiavo would
need to be hospitalized for several days while her electrolyte
balance was restored.
</P>
<P>
Schiavo's husband and parents, once close, have battled over her fate
since 1998, when the husband asked a state court's permission
to remove life support.
</P>
<P>
Terri Schiavo suffered extensive brain damage when her heart stopped beating
one night in 1990, apparently caused by a potassium deficiency
that may have been caused by an eating disorder. She
can breathe on her own and has periods of wakefulness,
but Judge George Greer of Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court, who presided
over the case, accepted the testimony of doctors who said
she was in a "persistent vegetative state" and incapable of
thought or emotion.
</P>
<P>
More important, Greer found credible Michael Schiavo's testimony that his wife,
who left no written directive, had said on several occasions
that she would not want life-prolonging measures to be used
for her.
</P>
<P>
Whittemore frequently interjected questions, pressing Gibbs about his claim that Greer
had violated Schiavo's due process rights that he had not
given her a fair trial. Whittemore pointed out that Greer
had held a "lengthy" trial and had appointed several independent
"guardians ad litem" to represent Terri Schiavo's interests, and that
her parents had represented her interests, as they saw them,
by fighting the tube removal.
</P>
<P>
Whittemore asked Gibbs to cite case law that would bolster the
claim that Schiavo's 14th Amendment rights to due process had
been violated, adding, "because we haven't found any." Without proof
that the state court's handling of the case violated precedent,
Whittemore said, "I think you would be hard pressed to
convince me that you have substantial likelihood" of succeeding on
the merits of the case.
</P>
<P>
Gibbs promised to provide case law backing up his claims as
soon as possible. But he also said that under the
new law passed by Congress, the federal court should "not
unduly trouble itself with the history" of the case in
state court. Gibbs is seeking a new trial with a
jury, which was lacking in the 2000 trial held by
Greer.
</P>
<P>
But when Gibbs said that Greer's findings were irrelevant under the
congressional measure, Whittemore replied, "That's not how I read the
act."
</P>
<P>
Felos, representing Michael Schiavo, sought to focus Whittemore on the question
of the constitutionality of the congressional act passed in the
early morning hours. He argued that Congress did not have
the authority to allow a federal review of the case
because the Constitution says it is up to a state
to decide whether due process rights have been violated.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, life is sacred," Felos said, "but so is liberty, your
honor, especially in this country."
</P>
<P>
Robert Schindler, who attended the hearing without his wife, left the
courthouse looking grim. Outside, protesters supporting the Schindlers heckled Felos
as he told reporters he felt optimistic about the case.
</P>
<P>
Gibbs told reporters he was not discouraged by the judge's refusal
to rule from the bench.
</P>
<P>
"His reputation is one that is very careful, he is very
methodical," he said, though he added, "Every moment is precious."
</P>
<P>
In Tallahassee, Gov. Jeb Bush said he was grateful to Congress
for passing a law but said he still wanted the
Florida Legislature to pass a measure tightening the requirements for
guardianship. Michael Schiavo lives with a girlfriend with whom he
has had two children, and the governor said that presented
a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
"I think our state ought to change our laws to say
in those circumstances, that that guardian needs to be changed,"
Bush said.

Justices Decline Schiavo Case; Hope for Keeping Woman Alive Fades

PINELLAS PARK, Fla.

<TEXT>
<P>
Even some of the most ardent supporters of a
seven-year battle to keep Terri Schiavo alive began to resign
themselves to what appeared inevitable Thursday: saying goodbye for
the last time.
</P>
<P>
A string of courtroom defeats and bleak prospects for victory in
further appeals left Schiavo's parents, Robert and Mary Schindler,
with a fast-shrinking field of options. The couple watched Thursday as
the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear their appeal and a Pinellas
County judge blocked Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, R, from taking custody of
the brain-damaged woman to have her feeding tube reinserted.
</P>
<P>
The legal setbacks angered many of the protesters here and drew the
largest crowds yet to demonstrations outside Schiavo's hospice, where
the phrase ``death watch'' was repeated over and over. Frustration
spilled out on talk radio programs, with some callers asking for
drastic and highly unlikely measures, including mobilizing the
National Guard to seize Schiavo before she dies.
</P>
<P>
``Absent a kidnapping, Terri Schiavo is going to remain in the
hospice,'' said George Felos, attorney for Schiavo's husband, Michael
Schiavo, who says his wife would not want to live in her current
condition. ``The entire judicial system of the United States -- state
courts and entire federal court system -- has said this case must end.
This case is over.''
</P>
<P>
Even as Felos was declaring a conclusion to the case, the governor
pressed appeals that argue the state has authority to take custody of
Schiavo to investigate abuse allegations and to consider a state
medical report that says she may not be in a vegetative state. But
courts have consistently rejected previous appeals related to abuse
allegations and new medical diagnoses. The Schindlers' lawyers also
were asking a federal judge in Tampa, who had ruled against them
earlier this week, to consider additional legal arguments. The
frenetic maneuvers unspooled while supporters of keeping Schiavo alive
decried the U.S. Supreme Court's decision early Thursday not to take
the case.
</P>
<P>
``The president is saddened by the latest ruling,'' White House
spokeswoman Dana Perino said Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
As it became more apparent that Terri Schiavo may die soon, Michael
Schiavo's legal team began to disclose plans for her burial. The
courts have rejected requests by the Schindlers to block Michael
Schiavo from having her cremated. The parents say cremation would
violate the religious beliefs of their daughter, who was a practicing
Catholic. Felos said Schiavo would be cremated and buried in a plot
owned by Michael Schiavo's family in Pennsylvania, where the couple
grew up.
</P>
<P>
``All week my heart has been waiting for that angel to come in and
save her again, just as it has in the past,'' Terri Schiavo's
childhood friend Diane Meyer said in a halting, emotional voice during
a phone interview from her home in Pennsylvania. ``But I know,
eventually, if all their attempts just don't work out, I have to come
to terms with it.''
</P>
<P>
Some Catholics have marveled at the weighty symbolic possibility
that Schiavo, 41, could die between Good Friday and Easter Sunday, the
holiest period on the church's calendar. ``That's the kind of
convergence no one could have planned,'' said Richard Doerflinger, an
opponent of ending Schiavo's feeding and vice president of the
Pro-Life Secretariat of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.
``People will say, 'Terri Schiavo died for our sins in a society that
does not care enough for the helpless.' ''
</P>
<P>
The Schindler family spent the day shuttling between the Woodside
Hospice and a small gift store across the street donated for their use
by the owner. The short walks inevitably turned into slow processions
as camera crews and reporters crowded around the family and followed
them until they reached a line of police guarding the one-story brick
and shingle hospice.
</P>
<P>
Randall Terry, the founder of the antiabortion group Operation
Rescue who now works as a Christian activist, served as family
spokesman, recounting the wrenching details of their bedside visits.
``She looked like she just came from Auschwitz,'' he said Schiavo's
sister, Suzanne Vitadamo, told him after visiting Schiavo. He told
reporters that Mary Schindler became ill after leaning toward her
daughter, who has been without food or hydration since Friday. ``It
was as if Terri was begging her for help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The Schindlers have been insulated by as many as 30 family members,
some of whom occasionally peered through the tinted windows of the
gift shop's door. Couches and chairs have been brought in to create an
impromptu living room, where family members have sat chatting for
hours to try to distract them from their grief, said Mary Schindler's
brother, Mike Tammaro. There is no television or radio, he said, only
the constant chime of cell phones.
</P>
<P>
A parade of supportive celebrities has phoned the Schindlers,
Tammaro said. His sister or her husband have spoken with Mel Gibson,
Pat Boone and ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' star Patricia Heaton. Mary
Schindler ``is having a hard time realizing (Schiavo's) days are
running out,'' Tammaro said, and has had trouble getting out of bed in
the morning even though she is a lifelong early riser.
</P>
<P>
Tammaro, one of the few family members allowed to visit Schiavo,
said he ``laid hands'' on her during a moment of prayer with several
other family members this week. ``I felt her move to my touch,'' he
said. Schiavo, he said, often appears to laugh when someone tells a
joke.
</P>
<P>
The Schindlers had been hoping that Gov. Bush could save their
daughter by presenting an affidavit from William Cheshire, a
neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., who believes
Schiavo may be in a ``minimally conscious,'' rather than
``vegetative,'' state, as court-appointed doctors believe.
</P>
<P>
Cheshire has been vocal critic of assisted suicide. An article
attributed to him on the Web site restorationfoundation.org advocated
Jews converting to Christianity. ``Should not we who are in Christ
lift the yoke of persecution from the shoulders of the Jewish people
and refresh them with the truth of the Lord of the Sabbath?'' the
article says.
</P>
<P>
Pinellas County Circuit Judge George Greer ruled that Bush's
attempt to use Cheshire's report as a basis for taking custody of
Schiavo appeared to be a violation of the constitutional separation of
the legislative, judicial and executive branches. ``By clear and
convincing evidence, it was determined she did not want to live under
such burdensome conditions and that she would refuse such medical
treatment-assistance,'' Greer wrote.
</P>
<P>
Bush may have missed an opportunity to take custody of Schiavo on
Thursday morning. For about three hours, Felos said, there was no
judicial impediment stopping the state from seizing Schiavo and
resuming her tube-feeding because an arcane rule granted an automatic
stay of court orders after an appeal was filed at 8:15 a.m. Realizing
that the appeal opened a window of opportunity, Felos said, he asked
Greer to issue another order nullifying the stay. Once the state
figured out what was happening, Felos said, its lawyers apparently
tried to stall a Thursday morning hearing before Greer to give
officers time to drive to the hospice. But Greer issued the order
shortly after 11 a.m., preventing any possible state action. Another
attempt to seize Schiavo may have been set in motion the day before,
Felos said.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officers and an attorney for Morton Plant Hospital,
where Schiavo's tube was to be reinserted, told Felos and his legal
team that the governor's office had notified them that agents from the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement were preparing to take custody
of Schiavo and drive her to the hospital. Those phone calls prompted
Felos to ask Greer to issue the order that was handed down late
Wednesday afternoon blocking the state from taking custody and
authorizing ``each and every'' sheriff's deputy in the state to stop
any attempt to remove Schiavo from the hospice.
</P>
<P>
The possible intervention of Bush briefly heartened the crowd
outside the hospice. But hope was fading late Thursday. Unable to do
anything else, a gray-haired woman in a long black dress fell to her
knees as the sky was darkening. She clasped her hands and her lips
moved, in silent prayer.

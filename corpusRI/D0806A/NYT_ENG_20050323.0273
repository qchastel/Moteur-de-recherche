GOV. BUSH WINS NEW HEARING IN SCHIAVO CASE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CLEARWATER, Fla.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a predawn federal appeals court ruling that
rejected efforts to restore nutrition to Terri Schiavo, Gov. Jeb
Bush succeeded on Wednesday in getting a state court to
hear new motions in her case, presenting an affidavit from
a neurologist who said Schiavo's condition appeared less severe than
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
Bush held a news conference Wednesday afternoon to announce the affidavit
and to suggest that officials might seek to gain legal
custody of Schiavo. Later, state lawyers appeared before Judge George
W. Greer of Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court, who ordered Schiavo's feeding
tube removed last week, and asked for the second time
in a month to intervene in the case.
</P>
<P>
Greer did not rule on their request immediately, but he granted
a request from Schiavo's husband, Michael, to bar the state's
Department of Children and Families from taking custody of her,
from removing her from the hospice where she has gone
six days without her feeding tube, and from providing her
with nutrition or hydration.
</P>
<P>
George Felos, the lawyer for Michael Schiavo, who had sought to
end life support for his brain-damaged wife, said he had
heard "credible" rumors that state officials planned to send doctors
to the hospice to give Terri Schiavo intravenous fluids.
</P>
<P>
Greer also directed state sheriffs to enforce the order.
</P>
<P>
The governor indicated that the state might indeed try to take
custody of Terri Schiavo, which the law would allow it
to do under certain circumstances. He said a new review
by Dr. William P. Cheshire, a neurologist in Jacksonville, suggested
that Schiavo had been misdiagnosed as being in a "persistent
vegetative state," meaning she could not think, emote or remember.
</P>
<P>
Cheshire, who visited Schiavo in her hospice room for an hour
and reviewed videotapes of her made by her parents, said
that she appeared to be minimally conscious.
</P>
<P>
"This new information raises serious concerns and warrants immediate action," Bush
said. "If there's any uncertainty, we should err on the
side of protecting her."
</P>
<P>
Even before dawn broke, the parents of Terri Schiavo were dealt
a setback when a divided three-judge panel of the federal
appeals court in Atlanta refused to order Schiavo's feeding tube
to be reinserted.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed the enactment by Congress of an unusual law
allowing federal court review in the case. But a federal
judge in Tampa ruled that a lawsuit brought under the
law had so little chance of ultimate success that there
was no need to preserve Schiavo's life in the meantime.

Florida governor turns to US Supreme Court in euthanasia case

<P>
Florida's Governor Jeb Bush on Wednesday asked the US Supreme Court
to intervene to keep a comatose woman alive, over the wishes of her
husband, who wants to disconnect the feeding tube that has sustained
her for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Florida's state Supreme Court has already issued a ruling that
cleared the way to remove Terri Schiavo's feeding tube, striking down
a law Bush had pushed through the state legislature to reinsert the
tube after her husband had had it taken out.
</P>
<P>
In his appeal, Bush claims the Florida ruling was invalid because
Schiavo did not have an independent legal guardian in the case to
advocate for her interests, said the governor's lawyer, Ken Connor.
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Michael Schiavo, and her parents, Robert and Mary
Schindler, have conflicts of interest that prevent them from fairly
deciding whether to keep her alive, Connor told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"Terri Schiavo's husband and guardian, had financial and personal
conflicts of interest that made it impossible for him adequately to
protect her interests," the filing said.
</P>
<P>
"Terri Schiavo had never been adequately represented at any point
during the substituted judgment trial," it said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors say that Schiavo has been in a persistent vegetative state
for the last 14 years since suffering a heart attack, and has no hope
of recovering.
</P>
<P>
Her husband has fought for legal permission to remove a feeding tube
in Terri's stomach.
</P>
<P>
The woman's parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, want to keep the feeding
tube inserted so as to keep up the supply of nutrients and vitamins
to their comatose daughter.
</P>
<P>
Removal of the tube would result in Terri Schiavo's death.
</P>
<P>
The Florida Legislature passed the so-called "Terri's law" in October
2003, allowing for the reinsertion of the feeding tube after lower
courts ruled to remove it.
</P>
<P>
Bush, the brother of President George W. Bush, opposes euthanasia and
has fought to keep Schiavo alive.

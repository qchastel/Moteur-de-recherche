LEGAL BATTLE GOES ON AFTER JUDGE REBUFFS PARENTS

<P>
A federal judge refused to order Terri
Schiavo's feeding tube reinserted Tuesday, and as their legal options
dwindled her stunned parents quickly appealed to the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which gave no hint when it
would rule.
</P>
<P>
The parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, stayed mostly out of sight,
but supporters said they were devastated and that their daughter's
condition was deteriorating as the third court in a week
considered her case. In Tallahassee, other advocates of preserving Schiavo's
life ratcheted up pressure on Gov. Jeb Bush and the
state Legislature to find another solution.
</P>
<P>
Congress passed an unusual law on Monday allowing federal courts to
intervene in the case, but a move that Republican leaders
and Schiavo's family hoped would immediately block her death was
proving more complicated. In a ruling issued at dawn, Judge
James D. Whittemore of U.S. District Court in Tampa wrote
that the Schindlers had not established a "substantial likelihood of
success" if a new trial were held in federal court.
</P>
<P>
The Schindlers appealed by midafternoon, telling a three-judge federal appeals panel
in Atlanta that their daughter must be reconnected to a
feeding tube immediately or the efforts of Congress and President
Bush to help keep her alive would amount to "a
vain and useless act."
</P>
<P>
Their lawyer, David Gibbs, also asked the panel to order doctors
to resume feeding Schiavo while it weighed the appeal, writing,
"Terri is fading quickly and her parents reasonably fear that
her death is imminent."
</P>
<P>
While the fate of Schiavo was argued over in court papers,
the case continued to roil Washington. Some conservatives criticized the
aggressive efforts of Congress to use the federal courts to
override state rulings, saying it violated a cornerstone of conservative
philosophy. In addition, the case injected another explosive element into
the congressional debate over Bush's choices for federal judgeships.
</P>
<P>
Outside the hospice where the severely brain-damaged Schiavo, 41, entered her
fifth day without nutrition and hydration, a spokesman for her
parents said that Schiavo was "now showing signs of starving
to death."
</P>
<P>
But a lawyer for Schiavo's husband, Michael, whom a state judge
granted permission to disconnect her feeding tube and let her
die, said she was not suffering.
</P>
<P>
"Terri is stable, peaceful, calm," the lawyer, George Felos, said.
</P>
<P>
Legal scholars said it would be highly unusual for the Atlanta
appeals court to order the feeding tube reinserted based on
its analysis of Whittemore's ruling. But the Schiavo case has
surprised at every turn.

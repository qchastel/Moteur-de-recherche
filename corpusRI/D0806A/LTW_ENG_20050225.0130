Fifteen years to the day after Terri Schiavo
suffered severe brain damage, leaving her in a persistent vegetative
state, a judge on Friday ordered that the feeding tube keeping her
alive be removed in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
According to Pinellas Circuit Judge George W. Greer's instructions,
Schiavo's husband, Michael, should disconnect the tube at 1 p.m. on
March 18.
</P>
<P>
Schiavo contends that his wife did not want to live through
artificial means. But her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, argue that
their daughter could improve with therapy. Their lawyer said Friday
that they would appeal Greer's order.

<P>
Earlier this week, the judge issued two brief stays barring Michael
Schaivo from having his 41-year-old wife's food and water halted. But
on Friday, Greer refused to further block his original order, issued
in February 2000, that the tube be taken out.
</P>
<P>
``The court is no longer comfortable granting stays simply upon the
filing of new motions and petitions, since there will always be `new
issues' that can be pled,'' the judge said. Over the next three weeks,
Greer said, Schiavo's parents ``will need to demonstrate before the
appellate courts that their requests have merit and are worthy of a
stay.''
</P>
<P>
Standing in an afternoon rain outside the hospice here where his
daughter is being cared for, Bob Schindler said: ``There are so many
legal issues to argue. I'm afraid we don't have the time.''
</P>
<P>
Michael Schiavo expressed satisfaction that his in-laws' request
for another stay had been rejected.
</P>
<P>
``I am very pleased that the court has recognized there must be a
finality to this process,'' Schiavo said in a statement released by
his attorney, George J. Felos said. ``I am hopeful and confident that
the appellate court will also agree that Terri's wishes not to be kept
alive artificially must now be enforced.''
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 25, 1990, Terri Schiavo collapsed from what doctors later
said was a potassium imbalance. She left no living will or written
instructions on what treatment she desired if she were to become
incapacitated -- the reason for the protracted legal battle between
her husband and parents.
</P>
<P>
David C. Gibbs III, the Schindlers' attorney, said he would be in
Greer's office early Monday. He said he would appeal the judge's
denial of an extended stay; he also planned to appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court on the grounds that Terri Schiavo -- a Roman Catholic --
would not wish to be deprived of food and water in accordance with the
latest papal teachings on how to care for the incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
Gibbs said he would seek to have a lawyer appointed for Terri
Schiavo. All the time that her fate has been pondered by the courts,
he said, she has never had the benefit of legal representation --
which he termed a denial of her due process rights.
</P>
<P>
``I believe if Ted Bundy got a lawyer, Terri Schiavo should get a
lawyer,'' Gibbs said, referring to the notorious serial killer
executed in Florida.

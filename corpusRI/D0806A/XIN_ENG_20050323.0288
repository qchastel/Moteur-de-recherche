US court refuses to reinsert feeding tube to brain-damaged woman

<P>
The full US 11th Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta, Georgia, refused on Wednesday to reconsider
a request to reinsert the feeding tube to a brain-damaged woman in
Florida, dealing another blow to hopes of her parents to keep her 
alive.
</P>
<P>
The 10-2 ruling came hours after a three-judge panel from the 
appeals court ruled against the family.
</P>
<P>
The parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, suffered another 
setback Wednesday when the Florida legislature decided not to 
intervene in the struggle. Florida Governor Jeb Bush, meanwhile, 
sought court permission to take custody of Terri Schiavo, 41, who 
was incapacitated in 1990 when her heart stopped briefly cutting 
oxygen to her brain.
</P>
<P>
President George W. Bush said on Wednesday that he had 
considered all options before the Congress passed an unprecedented
legislation and he signed it into law over the weekend. The law 
shifted the jurisdiction of Schiavo's case from state courts to 
federal courts.
</P>
<P>
Suggesting Shiavo's fate now rested with the courts, Bush said,
"I have looked at all options prior to taking the action we took 
last weekend in concert with Congress ... And now we'll watch the 
courts make its decisions."
</P>
<P>
Shiavo's feeding tube was disconnected last Friday with state 
judge's approval, which led to the weekend effort by Congressional
Republicans to push through the unprecedented emergency 
legislation. Doctors have suggested Shiavo could survive one to 
two weeks without the feeding tube.
</P>
<P>
The Schindlers have vowed to appeal to the US Supreme Court, 
which refused to get involved previously.
</P>
<P>
Shiavo's husband has said she did not want to be kept alive 
artificially and has no hope for recovery, but her parents have 
contended that Schiavo's condition could improve with treatment.

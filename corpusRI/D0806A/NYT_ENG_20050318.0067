JUDGE HALTS REMOVAL OF SCHIAVO'S FEEDING TUBE AFTER CONGRESS INTERVENES

<P>
A Florida judge has delayed an order to remove the
feeding tube from a brain-damaged Florida woman at 1 p.m.
Friday after Washington lawmakers intervened by issuing subpoenas for the
woman and her husband to appear at congressional hearings later
this month.
</P>
<P>
The order by Judge David Demers of Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court came
in response to efforts in the U.S. House and Senate
to circumvent an order to remove the tube from the
woman, Terri Schiavo, who suffered severe brain damage 15 years
ago. Demers' order was intended to be in force for
less than an hour, to give the presiding judge in
the long-running case, George W. Greer of Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court,
time to get to his chambers and weigh the latest
developments.
</P>
<P>
The Washington lawmakers' extraordinary maneuvers managed to block, at least temporarily,
decisions by several courts over the last few years that
have sided with Schiavo's husband, Michael Schiavo, who said his
wife would not want to be kept alive in her
present condition.
</P>
<P>
The subpoenas came from a House committee inviting Schiavo, 41, and
her husband, Michael, to appear before Congress next week.
</P>
<P>
A Senate committee also issued an invitation for the Schiavos to
appear on Capitol Hill. The Senate majority leader, Sen. Bill
Frist, R-Tenn., issued a statement saying that Schiavos and her
husband were being called in connection with a congressional inquiry
into the matter later this month. The statement pointed out
that federal law protects witnesses called before Congress "from anyone
who may obstruct or impede a witness' attendance or testimony."
</P>
<P>
The maneuver is the latest step by lawmakers who are determined
to keep Schiavo alive to prevent doctors from beginning to
withhold nutrition and fluids from her, a process that could
result in her death in anywhere from a few days
to a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Friday's 1 p.m. deadline set by Greer followed years of legal
wrangling between Schiavo's husband, who wants to let her die,
and her parents, who believe she responds to them and
want her to live.
</P>
<P>
The last-minute actions in Washington have prolonged the drama about who
ultimately has the right to determine the woman's fate, as
relatives and other supporters of right-to-life causes who have been
attracted to Schiavo's case gathered outside the Clearwater, Fla., hospice
where she lies in a hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
Schiavo collapsed in 1990 and suffered extensive brain damage when her
heart briefly stopped, possibly due to a potassium deficiency. Eight
years later, her husband wanted to remove her feeding tube,
setting off years of legal feuding with her parents that
has taken both sides from the state and federal courts
to the State Legislature to the U.S. Supreme Court, and
now to Congress.
</P>
<P>
"The Senate and House remain dedicated to saving Terry Schiavo's life,"
Frist said, adding that March 28 was the date set
for the Schiavos to appear in Congress. "The purpose of
the hearing is to review health care policies and practices
relevant to the care of nonambulatory persons such as Mrs.
Schiavo."

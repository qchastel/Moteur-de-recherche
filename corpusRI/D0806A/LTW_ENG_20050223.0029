Florida Governor's Office Again Intervenes in Case
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CLEARWATER, Fla.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The administration of Gov. Jeb Bush, already
forcefully rebuked by Florida's supreme court for trying to override
judicial orders and block the removal of a brain-damaged woman's
feeding tubes, launched itself back into the case on Wednesday by
asking for a delay to investigate abuse allegations.
</P>
<P>
The surprise request by Florida's Department of Children and
Families to intervene in the case of Terri Schiavo stirred an already
emotional atmosphere. A woman broke with courtroom decorum and called
out ``Amen'' when an attorney for Schiavo's parents, who are trying to
stop her husband from removing the feeding tube, announced in Pinellas
County Circuit Court that the department has asked for a delay.
</P>
<P>
``We have been complaining and complaining and complaining that
Terri has been abused, and it's fallen on deaf ears,'' Schiavo's
father, Robert Schindler, said after the court hearing.
</P>
<P>
The legal maneuver adds a new layer of complication to the
seven-year case, which has drawn an eclectic mix of monks,
antiabortion activists and conservative Christian activists to this
town west of Tampa. George Felos, the lead attorney for Schiavo's
husband, Michael Schiavo, said the maneuver ``reeks of political
arm-twisting.''
</P>
<P>
``The governor and the Legislature -- the politicians -- have tried
to do an end run around the court system.'' In the past few years,
Felos said, ``scores'' of abuse allegations from anonymous tipsters
have been proven untrue.
</P>
<P>
While the case is slogging through the courts, its political
aspects have been omnipresent. It has been a hot topic among
legislators in Tallahassee, and after Wednesday's hearing, Operation
Rescue founder Randall Terry said he and others are working with
Florida lawmakers to speed passage of a law that would strip Schiavo's
husband of his authority as guardian because he now lives with another
woman.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, Bush was criticized by bioethicists and constitutional
scholars for pushing a law through the Florida Legislature that gave
him the right to stop Michael Schiavo from removing the feeding tubes
that have kept his wife alive since she collapsed 15 years ago. The
Florida Supreme Court said Bush ``violated a cornerstone of American
democracy.'' The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from
Bush.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the governor told reporters that ``I can assure you,
I will do whatever I can within the means, within the laws, of our
state to protect this woman's life.'' A Bush spokesman said the
governor, who appoints the head of the children and families
department, did not ask the agency to enter the case.
</P>
<P>
The agency's request was sealed, making it impossible to assess the
move, said Elizabeth Foley, a Florida International University law
professor who teaches bioethics.
</P>
<P>
``Who the heck knows?'' Foley said. ``The state has an unqualified
interest in preserving life ... but if it's the 'same 'ol, same 'ol,'
it does seem like the executive branch is trying to circumvent the
judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
Amidst the uproar over the abuse investigation, the oft-delayed
case was delayed again on Wednesday to give Pinellas County Circuit
Court Judge George Greer, who had already issued a 1-day stay this
week, until Friday to consider a request for an indefinite stay.
Before the back-to-back delays, Schiavo's husband had said he would
order doctors to remove her feeding tubes on Wednesday as soon as
another stay that had been in place expired.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Schindlers have raised half a dozen legal issues
that they say must be resolved before a decision about pulling the
feeding tubes. Among them are arguments that Michael Schiavo should be
removed as guardian, that Pope John Paul II's labeling of euthanasia
as ``a sin'' should be weighed by the courts because Terri Schiavo was
a practicing Catholic and that new scientific developments suggest she
might be ``minimally conscious,'' rather than in a vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
Felos argued that the case has been resolved since an order
allowing the feeding tube removal in 2000 and that the Schindlers'
attorneys are concocting legal arguments merely to get more delays.
Terri Schiavo's cerebral cortex, Felos said, is now ``a giant black
hole.''

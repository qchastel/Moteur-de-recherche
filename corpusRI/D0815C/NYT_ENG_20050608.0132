SENATE CONFIRMS BROWN JUDICIAL NOMINATION, VOTES TO END PRYOR DEBATE

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
The Senate voted 56-43 to elevate conservative California jurist
Janice Rogers Brown to the nation's most important federal appeals
court Wednesday, the second of President Bush's controversial nominees to
win confirmation under a special agreement between centrist Republicans and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Brown, 55, a member of the California Supreme Court, won confirmation
after nearly two years of efforts by Democrats to deny
her a lifetime appointment to the federal bench, contending that
she has ignored legal precedents with rulings that promote an
ultra-conservative political agenda.
</P>
<P>
But her Republican supporters have countered that she is a model
of judicial restraint, and in nearly every speech from the
Senate floor in recent weeks, they have lauded her rise
from a poor childhood in segregated Alabama to prominence as
a judge.
</P>
<P>
But while many white Republican senators praised Brown as a role
model for African Americans, the only African American in the
Senate, Barak Obama, D-Ill., voted against her and cautioned that
Brown was not deserving of support "just because she is
a black woman."
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, members of the Congressional Black Caucus walked into
the Senate to demonstrate their opposition to Brown.
</P>
<P>
"Send a message that extremists are unacceptable to the federal judiciary,"
Rep. Melvin Watt, D-N.C., said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Senate vote clears the way for Brown to take a
seat on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, one of 12 courts of appeal in
the federal judiciary, but the only one with special jurisdiction
over legal challenges arising from decisions and rules of federal
agencies located in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also voted 67-32 to end debate on Bush's nomination
of former Alabama attorney general William Pryor to a permanent
seat on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based
in Atlanta. Pryor has been serving on the court under
a temporary appointment since February 2004.
</P>
<P>
By ending debate on Pryor's nomination, the Senate set the stage
for his confirmation as well, probably Thursday, the last confirmation
vote guaranteed under an agreement reached by the "Gang of
14" senators from both parties to avoid a potentially damaging
fight over the Senate's rules on debate.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, while granting a floor vote to long-stalled Bush judicial
nominees Brown, Pryor and Priscilla Owen, confirmed to a seat
on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, also preserved
the right of the Democratic minority to filibuster future nominees
under undefined "extraordinary conditions."
</P>
<P>
Whether such conditions will be present after Pryor's floor vote is
unclear, but Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has reiterated
he will undertake special - and controversial - procedures to
prevent any further filibusters of judicial nominees by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
But immediately after Wednesday's votes, Frist said the Senate had "broken
the impasse" on judicial nominees and, after confirmation votes on
Pryor and a handful of non-controversial pending nominations, the Senate
will begin work on energy legislation, probably next week.
</P>
<P>
"The American people will know we're doing the nation's business," added
Frist.
</P>
<P>
Congressional approval ratings have plummeted this spring, and Democrats have charged
that the Republican-controlled Senate has spent too much time on
Bush's judicial nominees instead of dealing with the country's problems.
</P>
<P>
"We've spent endless hours, endless days, too many weeks debating radical
judges and Republican attempts to abuse power," Senate Minority Leader
Harry Reid, D-Nev., said.
</P>
<P>
Four polls conducted last month found Congress with its lowest levels
of public support in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
The fight over the nominees has not only dominated the work
of the Senate but has deepened the political divide in
the nation's capital because of the potential the president has
to reshape the federal government in his conservative image through
such lifetime appointments.
</P>
<P>
And the Senate vote confirming Brown produced a flood of responses
from interest groups reflecting that political divide.
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad day for the Senate - and for
Americans who are counting on senators to fulfill their constitutional
duty to evaluate every judicial nominee carefully and confirm only
those who will uphold Americans' constitutional rights and legal protections,"
said Ralph Neas, president of People For The American Way,
the group most active in opposing her nomination.
</P>
<P>
"The Senate has set a standard for fairness with Janice Rogers
Brown and we expect the same for the remaining judicial
nominees," said Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council, a
Washington organization that has rallied evangelical Christians to the cause
of confirming Bush's nominees.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are especially interested in the possibility of a Supreme
Court vacancy this summer. Chief Justice William Rehnquist is 80
years old and suffering from cancer.

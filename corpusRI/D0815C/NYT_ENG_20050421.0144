COMMITTEE VOTE PUSHES SENATE CLOSER TO 'CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS'

<P>
A divided Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday sent two
controversial appeals court nominees toward a showdown vote in the
Senate, setting the stage for what Democrats described as a
looming "constitutional crisis" over President Bush's judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
With Democrats forming a solid wall of dissent, the Republican-dominated committee
voted 10-8 to revive the long-dormant nominations of Priscilla Owen
of Texas and Janice Rogers Brown of California. The two
were blocked by threatened Democratic filibusters during the last session
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
The action propels the Senate toward a volatile, partisan confrontation, with
Republicans contemplating a rules change that would prohibit further judicial
filibusters and enable Bush to win Senate confirmation of his
embattled court appointees. Democrats describe the rules change as a
"nuclear option" and are threatening to slow down Senate business
if Republicans persist.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important and historic meeting," declared Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y. "We're in the ramp-up to a great constitutional crisis."
</P>
<P>
Republicans, who have a majority in the 100-member Senate, say the
time has come to end what they describe as politically
motivated obstructionist tactics by Democrats and sustain the president's right
to send his nominees to the bench.
</P>
<P>
Democrats, in turn, say they have helped confirm 205 judicial nominees
but object to a handful who are either unqualified or
too extreme to hold life-time judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
Owen, a Texas Supreme Court justice nominated to the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, has been held
up for nearly four years amid Democratic allegations that she
injected anti-abortion sentiments into her opinions and consistently handed down
rulings that penalized consumers and favored big business.
</P>
<P>
Her supporters dismiss those characterizations as groundless, describing the former Houston
attorney as fair-minded and more than qualified. The American Bar
Association gave Owen its highest recommendation in examining her qualifications
for nomination.
</P>
<P>
"She deserves to be confirmed," said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a
member of the committee. "She's waited four years for an
up-and-down vote in the United States Senate."
</P>
<P>
"The way she's been treated is less than humane," said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
But leading Democrats stood firm in their opposition to Owen. "Nothing
has changed since we last reviewed her record to make
Justice Owen worthy of confirmation now," said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass. "If anything, her decisions since then only confirm
that she should not receive a life-time position on the
5th Circuit."
</P>
<P>
Schumer said he was "proud to oppose this nomination."
</P>
<P>
Brown, who now serves on the California Supreme Court, was nominated
to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District
of Columbia, which deals with cases involving much of the
federal government and is often described as second only to
the Supreme Court in importance.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said that she would use the bench to advance "extremist"
conservative views, but Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., countered that the
jurist is independent and hard-working, "with an open mind" and
"a lot of common sense."
</P>
<P>
Senate rules require 60 votes to stop a filibuster, traditionally long-winded
speeches designed to block or delay Senate action. The rules
change being considered by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn.,
would allow a simple 51-vote majority to end a filibuster.
Republicans have 55 votes, compared to 44 for Democrats and
one for the lone independent senator, Jim Jeffords of Vermont.

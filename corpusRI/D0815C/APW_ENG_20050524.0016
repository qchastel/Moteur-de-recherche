<P>
Averting a showdown, centrists from both parties reached agreement on a
compromise that clears the way for confirmation votes on many of President
George W. Bush's stalled judicial nominees, leaves others in limbo and preserves
Senate filibuster rules.
</P>
<P>
"In a Senate that is increasingly polarized, the bipartisan center held,"
Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The two-page memorandum of agreement said it is "based upon mutual trust and
confidence."
</P>
<P>
Under the terms, Democrats would agree to oppose any attempt to filibuster _ and
thus block final votes _ on the confirmation of Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers
Brown and William Pryor. There is "no commitment to vote for or against" the
filibuster against two other conservative nominees, Henry Saad and William
Myers.

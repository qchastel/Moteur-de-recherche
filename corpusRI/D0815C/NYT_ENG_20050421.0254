<HEADLINE>
WITH PARTY-LINE VOTE, COMMITTEE SENDS TWO JUDICIAL NOMINEES TO SENATE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved and sent
to the full Senate two of President Bush's candidates for
seats on the federal appeals bench.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who is the committee's chairman,
asked his colleagues to be brief, saying there was little
doubt that voting on the two candidates, Priscilla R. Owen
and Janice Rogers Brown, would be along party lines. It
was as he predicted, with each of the nominees receiving
favorable votes from all 10 Republicans on the committee while
all 8 Democrats voted against them.
</P>
<P>
That did not discourage committee members from brushing aside Specter's plea
for brevity and plunging into prolonged and angry debate about
the two nominees. Everyone understood that these candidates have come
to stand for more than their own hopes to be
confirmed; the two may be the test cases used by
Republican leaders to change the Senate rules to prohibit filibusters
to block judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
Dating from Bush's first term, Democrats have used a filibuster or
the threat of extended debate, to block 10 of the
president's choices for the federal appeals courts, while approving 35
others. Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Republican leader, has
warned with increasing ardor that he may seek to change
the rules so that the Democrats, who are in the
minority, would be unable to block Bush's judicial choices.
</P>
<P>
Both Owen, a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, and Brown,
a justice on the California Supreme Court, have been blocked
before by Democrats who have called them unfit for the
federal bench, asserting that they are hard-line conservative ideologues.
</P>
<P>
Sen Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the committee's ranking Democrat, said
Owen had shown herself to be "an ends-oriented activist judge"
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
The debate about Owen has centered on her dissents from court
rulings interpreting a state law allowing a minor to obtain
an abortion without the permission of a parent in certain
limited circumstances. In one dissent, Justice Owen said the teenager
in the case had not demonstrated that she knew that
there were religious objections to abortion and that some women
who underwent abortions had experienced severe remorse.
</P>
<P>
Alberto R. Gonzales, the attorney general, who was a member of
the court at the time, said the views of the
dissenters were far beyond what the Legislature had enacted and
amounted to "an unconscionable act of judicial activism." A review
of the court opinions shows that other judges also asserted
that Owen and her fellow dissenters were putting their own
views ahead of the law.
</P>
<P>
The author of the majority opinion in the principal case, Justice
Harriet O'Neill, wrote, "In deciding this case we squarely confront
the question of whether, as judges, we should apply the
Parental Notification Act as it is written by the Legislature
or according to our own personal beliefs." She added that,
"The issue's highly charged nature does not excuse judges who
impose their own personal convictions into what must be a
strictly legal inquiry."
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Brownback, R- Kan., said the opinion showed Owen was
"actually following the Legislature's intent. This is the kind of
judge we're looking for."
</P>
<P>
Brown was assailed by Democrats over some of her judicial opinions
but also over her many speeches in which she disparages
the usefulness of government. "She has a vitriolic hostility to
government," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. At her confirmation hearing
Brown said she was not an ideologue of any stripe.

FRIST DEMANDS JUDICIAL VOTES, SETS SENATE ON "NUCLEAR" COURSE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., demanded an up-or-down
vote on one of President Bush's more controversial judicial nominees
Wednesday, sparking an historic Senate floor debate that could be
the most consequential of Bush's presidency.
</P>
<P>
Frist brought Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen's nomination to the
Senate floor, setting the Senate on a course toward a
showdown vote as early as next week on changing its
rules and traditions to make it easier to confirm judicial
nominees.
</P>
<P>
Frist set the heated tone of daylong debate when he accused
Democrats of using obstructionist tactics "to kill, to defeat, to
assassinate" a handful of Bush nominees to federal appellate courts.
And he made it clear he is prepared to take
extraordinary parliamentary steps to stop the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Those steps, commonly referred to as the "nuclear option" in the
Senate dispute, would result in the Senate's rules being changed
so that a simple majority vote of 51 senators would
be enough to prevent filibusters of judicial nominees. Currently, it
takes 60 votes to stop a filibuster, a form of
extended debate that dates back to the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
"All we want is a vote - an up-or-down vote,' Frist
said. "Judicial nominees with the support of a majority of
senators deserve up-or-down votes on this floor ... Confirm the
nominee, reject the nominee, but in the end, vote."
</P>
<P>
But Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., charged that the threatened
attempt to change the Senate's rules is part of "a
power grab" by the Republican majority of the Senate, in
league with the Bush White House and the GOP-controlled House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the only check on President Bush is the Democrats'
ability to voice their concern in the Senate," Reid said.
"If Republicans roll back our rights in this chamber, there
will be no check on their power. The radical right
wing will be free to pursue any agenda they want.
And not just on judges. Their power will be unchecked
on Supreme Court nominees, the president's nominees in general and
legislation like Social Security privatization."
</P>
<P>
When Frist declined his proposal to adjourn the Senate debate to
the privacy of the old Senate chambers in the Capitol
- a two-story antiquated amphitheater abandoned by the Senate in
1859 - Reid fired what may have been a political
warning shot: he denied what is normally routine unanimous consent
to let committees meet more than two hours after the
Senate begins its session.
</P>
<P>
Reid had previously warned that if the Republican majority push the
"nuclear" parliamentary button, Democrats would stall all but the most
essential legislation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
At stake is not just the nomination of Owen and several
other Bush nominees to federal appellate courts but the president's
ability to steer the entire federal judiciary in a more
conservative direction with lifetime appointments to the nation's highest courts,
including the Supreme Court where Chief Justice William Rehnquist is
ailing with thyroid cancer.
</P>
<P>
As the debate raged on the Senate floor, moderate senators continued
to search for a compromise that would avoid a showdown
over the filibuster rule and the half-dozen Bush judicial nominees
that Democrats have blocked.
</P>
<P>
Four Democrats and eight Republicans met privately in the office of
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., seeking a deal of some kind,
but the meeting concluded only with an agreement to reconvene
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who blamed both parties
for bringing the Senate to the brink of a political
meltdown, decried such attempts at deal-making.
</P>
<P>
"Such a deal on confirmations would only confirm public cynicism about
what goes on in Washington behind closed doors," Specter said.
</P>
<P>
Democrats argued that the conservative views and judicial activism of Owen
and California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown, whose nomination
is next up on the Senate calendar, are beyond the
mainstream of legal thinking in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Bush has nominated Owen to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals and Brown to the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia, widely viewed as
second only to the Supreme Court in its impact on
the American legal system.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats recalled some of the criticism U.S. Attorney General Alberto
Gonzales leveled at Owen when they were colleagues on the
Texas Supreme Court. Gonzales once called Owen's judicial activism "unconscionable."
</P>
<P>
"Mainstream? I think not," Reid said. "Shockingly unjust or unscrupulous -
that's what Priscilla Owen is in the mind of the
attorney general of the United States."
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, in a brief meeting with reporters last week, down played
his past criticism of Owen and said he wholeheartedly endorsed
her federal court nomination.
</P>
<P>
Republicans countered the criticism of the two women by noting that
both had won overwhelming majorities in their elections to the
state courts on which they sit - 84 percent for
Owen, 76 percent for Brown.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, sought to shift the debate from
Owen's judicial record to personal qualities, saying, "I have heard
my colleagues and some interest groups use very extreme language
to describe Priscilla Owen. These statements are coming in many
cases from many people who have not met her."
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who met with Owen during the
nominee's courtesy visits with senators Tuesday, replied that "I couldn't
agree more she was a lovely person, but this is
not a debate about a lovely person - this is
a debate about a record ... and whether that record
merits appointing someone to a lifetime appointment."
</P>
<P>
Owen, a member of the Texas Supreme Court since 1994, has
a high rating from the American Bar Association. Her advocates
praise her rulings as no-nonsense while opponents characterize them as
hostile to families and women.
</P>
<P>
Bush first nominated Owen in 2001, but Democrats have blocked four
attempts by the Republican majority to bring her nomination to
a confirmation vote. Likewise, Brown, who was first nominated by
Bush in 2003, has been blocked by the Democrats on
four separate occasions.

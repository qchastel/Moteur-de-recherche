MODERATES SEEK COMPROMISE ON FILIBUSTERS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - Moderate Democratic and Republican senators met into the evening
Tuesday night in the hopes of avoiding a showdown over
filibusters of judicial nominees, as Republican leaders planned to launch
a carefully choreographed debate on the issue of judges Wednesday
that they hope will bring public opinion to their side.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen senators met behind closed doors with Senate majority
leader Bill Frist and Senate minority leader Harry Reid for
about an hour late Tuesday afternoon to discuss the framework
of the proposed compromise. However, a senior Democratic aide said
Tuesday night that the two leaders left the meeting as
far apart as ever, though that does not foreclose the
possibility of rank-and-file members reaching an agreement on their own.
</P>
<P>
Senator Ben Nelson, a Nebraska Democrat who is among the leaders
of the group seeking a compromise, emerged from the meeting
saying they were drawing close to a deal but remained
short of persuading the six Democrats and six Republicans they
need to seal the deal.
</P>
<P>
The agreement under discussion would bind the Republicans to preserving Democrats'
right to filibuster judges, on the condition that Democrats only
use filibusters in "extreme circumstances," Nelson said. Still undecided, however,
is the fate of eight men and women the White
House has already nominated for judgeships and Democratic leaders have
promised to filibuster.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, "There'll be judicious use of the filibuster, and
you won't have a nuclear option [a banning of filibusters]
in this session of Congress," Nelson told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear Tuesday whether Frist would sign off on such
a deal, however. The Tennessee Republican refused to comment on
his way out of the meeting, but has said he
will not take any deal that doesn't guarantee votes for
all nominees on the Senate floor. In addition, Frist is
under pressure from conservatives to ban filibusters before a vacancy
arises on the Supreme Court, and the proposed agreement would
not accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday night, Frist remained on track to force the
issue on the Senate floor, starting Wednesday morning. Frist is
moving to confirm two female judges with compelling life stories,
making it more difficult for Democrats to stand against them.
</P>
<P>
Republicans plan to stretch debate over several days and make a
show of trying to cut the Democrats off through normal
procedures, a move intended to highlight the perception of Democratic
obstructionism, Republican senators said.
</P>
<P>
"When you want to score, you run your best plays," said
Senator George Allen, Republican of Virginia. "And if it's tough
for the Democrats, that's fine with me."
</P>
<P>
Frist will bring up the nominations of Priscilla Owen and Janice
Rogers Brown Wednesday through the Senate's regular operating rules, but
a vote is unlikely to happen before next Tuesday or
Wednesday, according to Frist's top aides.
</P>
<P>
Frist hosted Owen and Rogers Brown for a photo opportunity Tuesday
at his office shortly after the two met with President
Bush at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"Our simple goal is to restore that 214 years of tradition
to allow these nominees a simple, fair up-or-down vote," Frist
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Democrats are fighting back by citing inflammatory statements and decisions handed
down by Owen and Rogers Brown. They are planning a
series of public events to state opposition to the judges,
and to any rules change that would make their confirmations
possible.
</P>
<P>
Under Senate rules, as few as 41 senators can force unlimited
debate through a procedure known as a filibuster, effectively killing
a nomination. Democrats used that power to scuttle 10 of
Bush's 218 judicial nominees in his first term, and have
vowed to do the same to defeat at least the
seven he has re-nominated this year.
</P>
<P>
Frist has promised to use a parliamentary maneuver that would outlaw
those filibusters, in essence lowering the threshold for confirmation from
60 votes to 50 votes. Conservatives are anxious for the
rules to be changed before a Supreme Court vacancy, but
Democrats have vowed to slow Senate business to a crawl
in response.
</P>
<P>
The proposed compromise - being spearheaded by Nelson and Senator John
McCain, Republican of Arizona - would probably be acceptable to
Reid if it preserves Democrats' ability to filibuster judges in
the future, according to aides to the Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
If the future of filibusters comes to a vote in the
Senate, neither side is sure of the outcome. Frist's maneuver
needs 50 votes to succeed, and while Republicans control 55
Senate seats, two senators have announced plans to side with
the Democrats and at least half a dozen others are
publicly undecided.

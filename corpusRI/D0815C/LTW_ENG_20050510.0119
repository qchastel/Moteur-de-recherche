<P>
The Senate's Republican and Democratic leaders called
for a prompt showdown in the impasse over judicial nominations
Tuesday, a move that would undercut moderates' efforts to find a
compromise to the long-running dispute.
</P>
<P>
Both parties' leaderships are wary of a bipartisan bid by a few
centrists to find a middle ground that would force GOP and Democratic
leaders to accept options they have called intolerable.
</P>
<P>
Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has said the ability to
filibuster judicial nominees, now or in the future, must end. Minority
Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., meanwhile, has said the right to filibuster
must remain intact and President Bush must withdraw three of his most
contentious appellate court nominees.
</P>
<P>
Neither man could claim victory under compromises being promoted by
Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., among others. Nelson said that the details of
his plan remain fluid, but that it would leave the filibuster rules
intact while confirming more of Bush's nominees than Reid has said his
party can accept. Nelson said senators would have to pledge to use
filibusters only in ``extreme or extraordinary cases.'' But
Republicans said Democrats have a history of labeling mainstream
conservatives as extremists.
</P>
<P>
Reid and Frist said they remain open to a possible compromise. But
both men rejected elements of Nelson's plan Tuesday and signaled that
they want a showdown vote on the filibuster issue -- often called ``the
nuclear option'' -- as early as next week, if not Friday.
</P>
<P>
Frist, noting that four of the controversial nominations could be
called to the Senate floor any time, told reporters that ``the
suggestion has been made, let's go straight through the executive
calendar and deal with them one by one. And I think it's time to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
Reid said Democrats ``are prepared for a vote on the nuclear
option.''
</P>
<P>
Nelson said in an interview that his biggest challenge is to find a
compromise ``without undermining the leaders in both caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
If a handful of Democrats broke with Reid, Nelson said, they could
confirm some or all of the seven appellate court nominees thwarted by
filibusters in Bush's first term and still awaiting action. And if
three more Republicans join the three who have vowed to oppose Frist's
effort to ban filibusters of judicial nominees, the GOP leader would
not have the 51 votes he needs to change the rule. But with party
leaders and outside interest groups pressuring senators to stick with
their caucuses, Nelson said, it may prove impossible to pass his
proposal.
</P>
<P>
If Republicans leave the right to filibuster judges intact, Reid
has said, his caucus will let them pick one appellate court nominee
for a non-filibustered confirmation from a group the Democrats have
strongly criticized: Janice Rogers Brown of California, William Myers
III of Idaho, Priscilla Owen of Texas and William Pryor Jr. of
Alabama. Frist rejected the offer again Tuesday, saying this ``is a
matter of principle, and the principle is this fairness of an
up-or-down vote'' for all nominees.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., suggested that exploring compromises may
help Frist gain the votes he will need to outlaw judicial filibusters.
Moderate GOP senators, Lott told radio talk host Tony Snow, ``have to
feel assured that every avenue has been explored. ... If every effort
has been made and fails, then they will be there'' when Frist calls
for the showdown vote.

Frist: `Now Is the Time' to Settle Judges Issue
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<P>
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist on Tuesday moved
the chamber closer to a long-threatened showdown between Republicans
and Democrats over President Bush's controversial judicial
nominations.
</P>
<P>
Frist, R-Tenn., said he intends to bring the first of several of
Bush's nominations to the Senate floor for a vote after the chamber
passes a transportation funding bill, which is expected by the end of
this week.
</P>
<P>
``Now is the time to address'' the judicial issue, Frist said at
his weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
Democrats are threatening to filibuster three of the four judicial
nominees currently awaiting confirmation by the Senate. As soon as
Democrats call a filibuster on one of them, Frist has said he will
move to change the rules of the Senate to prohibit use of the
procedure to block the confirmation votes.
</P>
<P>
It takes 60 votes to cut off a filibuster. During Bush's first
term, Democrats used the threat of a filibuster to block votes on 10
of his choices for federal appellate courts, charging the nominees
were ``extremist'' in their conservative views. Democrats participated
in the confirmation of about 200 judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Bush renominated seven of those who were
blocked.
</P>
<P>
If the rule change on the filibuster passes, it would clear the way
for all of the Bush nominees to have up-or-down votes on their
appointments. To win confirmation, they would need 51 votes in the
100-seat Senate.
</P>
<P>
Republicans accuse Democrats of breaking Senate tradition by
resorting to the filibuster threat to block judges. Democrats accuse
Bush and his Republican allies of breaking tradition by continuing to
push for controversial choices.
</P>
<P>
Frist declined to say which nominee he expected to bring up first
for a vote -- a choice that would determine how rapidly the
confrontation escalates.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Sen. Harry Reid, the minority leader from
Nevada, urged Frist to defuse tensions by proceeding with one of the
less controversial nominees. He suggested starting with Thomas
Griffith, who Bush has picked to serve on the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
Griffith is one of the four nominees pending before the Senate.
Reid said that although many Democrats oppose still him, they would
not organize a filibuster against him.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to send a
fifth nominee to the Senate floor -- William H. Pryor Jr., who was
renominated by Bush to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
Although Democrats filibustered his nomination in the past, they have
signaled that they will not do so again.
</P>
<P>
``We don't like any of those five,'' Reid said. ``But in an effort
to work toward saving this institution ... I would be willing to give
up on any one of those five.''
</P>
<P>
But that left open the prospect that Democrats would filibuster
Bush's other controversial nominees.
</P>
<P>
The other nominees pending before the full Senate are California
Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown, Texas Supreme Court Justice
Priscilla Owen -- a favorite among conservative activists -- and
William Myers, a former ranching and mining lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders have sent conflicting signals about which of the
nominees they would likely bring to the floor first.
</P>
<P>
In his comments to reporters, Frist singled out Owen for praise,
saying that ``it is just wrong that we do not allow her, after four
years (since she was first nominated), that courtesy of an up-or-down
vote.''
</P>
<P>
But a short while later, former California Gov. Pete Wilson
appeared at the Republicans' weekly policy luncheon to brief his
former Senate colleagues about Brown, who served for three years as
his legal affairs advisor.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Wilson said he believes Democrats are trying to
``demonize'' her, comparing her nomination to that of Supreme Court
Justice Clarence Thomas. Brown and Thomas are both black.
</P>
<P>
``I think that is most anathema to her Democratic critics -- they
don't like the idea of articulate conservatives and they particularly
don't like when it's a person of color,'' Wilson said. ``I don't think
that's a new phenomenon here.''
</P>
<P>
Both sides acknowledge that the central issue is less the current
list of nominees than the looming possibility of a Supreme Court
vacancy later this year.
</P>
<P>
``This fight is not about the seven radical nominations,'' Reid
told reporters. ``It's about clearing the way for a Supreme Court
nominee who only needs 51 votes, not 60,'' for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Frist said that Republicans ``have to look to the future to see
that nominees for ... the circuit court level and the Supreme Court
have that opportunity for an up-or-down vote.''
</P>
<P>
Leaders on both sides said Tuesday they saw little room for a deal
to avert the confrontation.

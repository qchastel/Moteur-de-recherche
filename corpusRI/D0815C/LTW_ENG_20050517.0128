Lawmakers Fail to Reach Filibuster Compromise

<P>
Moderate Democrats and Republicans failed Tuesday to
derail a confrontation over federal judgeships that both sides said
would begin playing out Wednesday on the floor of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders said they would start the day's Senate session
by fopening debate on President Bush's nomination of Texas Supreme
Court Justice Priscilla Owen to the federal appeals court in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers
Brown to the federal appeals court in the District of Columbia also
will be discussed in the coming days, but Republicans have decided to
focus on Owen in their dispute with Democrats over judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
Democrats previously used filibusters to block the nominations of
Owen and Brown and have said they would seek to do so again, setting
the stage for the Senate showdown.
</P>
<P>
Bush turned up the heat on the issue, saying Tuesday night that
senators have ``a duty to promptly consider each of these nominees on
the Senate floor, discuss and debate their qualifications, and then
give them the up-or-down vote they deserve'' rather than filibuster
them.
</P>
<P>
Bush's remarks to 1,500 donors attending a Republican Party
fund-raising gala represented an escalation of the administration's
campaign to pressure the Senate to act.
</P>
<P>
In the hours before the parliamentary battle was to begin, the
spotlight shone on a dozen or so centrists from both parties who
discussed a potential compromise to defuse the dispute.
</P>
<P>
After an hour and a half of discussions Tuesday evening that
included Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Senate
Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., the meeting broke up with no
progress reported.
</P>
<P>
The lead Democrat in the effort, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, told
reporters that talks would continue.
</P>
<P>
``Every time you talk, you gain ground, you don't lose ground,''
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation has been building for years as each party has
used various methods to thwart the other party's nominations to the
federal courts.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Democrats used the filibuster -- in which a
senator's right to extended debate is used as a stalling tactic -- to
block votes on 10 of Bush's nominations to federal appellate courts.
Democrats argued that those judges were conservative ideologues.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 60 votes are needed to end a filibuster and force a
confirmation vote; Republicans want to lower the threshold to 51 votes
for judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
``I really think people on both sides don't want this to happen,''
said Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., one of those working for a
compromise. ``Members on both sides don't want the explosion to
occur.''
</P>
<P>
The proposed compromise, brokered by Nelson and Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., would be a pact between six Republicans and six Democrats to
vote together to end filibusters of the stalled judicial nominees but
also oppose any change in the rules permitting such filibusters.
Republicans hold 55 seats in the 100-member Senate, so six GOP
defectors would be enough to deny Frist a majority vote on the
filibuster issue.
</P>
<P>
Owen and Brown, the two judges at the heart of the Republican
campaign against the filibuster, were in Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They had lunch at the White House with Bush's chief counsel,
Harriet Miers, dropped by the Oval Office for a brief visit with Bush
and then made a carefully orchestrated appearance on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation is expected to play out over the coming week in
stages and culminate early next week.
</P>
<P>
Owen is a favorite of abortion opponents and religious
conservatives because of several legal opinions she wrote denying
minors the right to an abortion without parental notification. Brown,
who is black, is considered more likely to attract the support of
independents and Republican moderates.
</P>
<P>
A senior Frist aide said Tuesday that Brown's nomination will move
to the Senate floor after confirmation votes for Owen and John R.
Bolton, Bush's nominee for U.N. ambassador. As a result, Brown's
confirmation battle is unlikely to reach the Senate floor until after
Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because the scenario was
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
The second stage is expected to begin Friday, the aide said, when
Republicans will file a motion to end debate on Owen. Two days later,
the Senate will hold a vote on the motion, known as ``cloture,'' which
requires 60 votes.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are expected to lose that vote, at which point Frist
will begin the climactic chapter, according to his aide. With Vice
President Dick Cheney presiding over the chamber in his capacity as
president of the Senate, Frist will make a motion suggesting that
senators should have the right to vote on judicial nominees after a
certain number of hours of debate have passed.
</P>
<P>
Cheney is expected to uphold the motion, Democrats are expected to
object, and the chamber will vote on whether to table, or reject, the
Democratic appeal. All those votes require a simple majority, the aide
said, and Cheney could break a possible tie.
</P>
<P>
Frist's motion would establish a precedent, he said, under which
all judicial nominations would get a vote after a certain amount of
debate and confirmation would require 51 votes. The precedent would
apply to all federal judges, including the Supreme Court.

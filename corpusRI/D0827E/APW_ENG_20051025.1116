Job losses after Hurricane Katrina sent Louisiana's unemployment rate soaring to
11.5 percent, the highest level since the 1980s oil crash, officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The state Labor Department said in its monthly report that 234,000 jobs were
lost in September _ the majority in southeastern Louisiana _ after Katrina
struck on Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
The figures represent only some of the fallout from Katrina, and none of the
damage done by Hurricane Rita's foray into Louisiana on Sept.
24.
</P>
<P>
The September unemployment rate was the highest since January 1987, when
Louisiana's economy was reeling from a major oil price crash that resulted in a
deep recession. The jobless rate was 5.8 percent in August and 5.7 percent in
September 2004.

<P>
Labor officials said in an early estimate last week that 296,365 people were
left unemployed by Katrina and Rita. It said that in a seven-week period that
stretched into October, it processed 271,846 eligible unemployment claims for
Katrina and 24,519 for Rita.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, there were 12,710 initial claims for unemployment in August and
11,946 in September of last year.

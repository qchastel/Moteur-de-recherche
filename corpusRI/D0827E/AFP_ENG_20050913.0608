</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The toll of Hurricane 
Katrina deaths rose to 657 Tuesday after Louisiana confirmed 144 
additional deaths.
</P>
<P>
Louisiana's toll jumped Tuesday as swiftly receding floodwaters 
enabled rescue workers to get into more areas of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
The total number of deaths attributed to Katrina now stands at 
423 in Louisiana, 218 in Mississippi, two in Alabama and 14 in 
Florida, according to officials in the different states.
</P>
<P>
The hundreds confirmed killed so far falls well short of initial 
predictions that up to 10,000 may have been claimed by the storm's 
winds and floods.
</P>
<P>
But Katrina now stands as the deadliest hurricane to hit the 
United States since 1928, when a storm killed 1,836 people in 
Florida, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.

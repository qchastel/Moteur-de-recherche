Hurricane Katrina could leave the world's 
insurers facing a bill of up to 50 billion dollars (40 billion 
euros), British company Brit Insurance forecast on Tuesday.

"The industry loss for Hurricane Katrina could be between 35 and 
50 billion dollars," Brit's chief executive Dane Douetil told 
reporters after the company posted a 61-percent rise in interim 
pre-tax profits.

Katrina will have "a profound impact on (insurance) market 
conditions", Douetil added. Up until now the highest estimate has 
been 35 billion dollars, forecast by Risk Management Solutions -- a 
US group specialised in evaluating the financial cost of disasters.

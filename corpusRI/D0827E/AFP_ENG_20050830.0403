Lloyd's, the world's biggest insurance 
underwriting market, predicted on Tuesday that the devastating 
impact of Hurricane Katrina would result in a "significant" number 
of claims.
</P>
<P>
"Lloyds expects to receive significant insurance claims as a 
result of Hurricane Katrina, predominantly in relation to offshore 
energy installations in the Gulf (of Mexico), property damage and 
business interruption," said a statement from the Lloyd's insurance 
market.
</P>
<P>
"We are today asking all insurers at Lloyds to supply details of 
the likely impact on their businesses, by Monday 12 September. Those 
returns will allow us to give more information about the markets 
overall exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the severity of Katrina, the Lloyds market is 
well-equipped to manage the financial impact of a catastrophe on 
this scale. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly Katrina had a major impact on businesses and 
communities in the Gulf Region of the United States. Lloyds priority 
now will be to assess and settle claims as speedily as possible, to 
help the reconstruction of that area."
</P>
<P>
Rescue crews worked frantically Tuesday to save hundreds of 
people trapped by floodwaters from Hurricane Katrina, which 
devastated the US Gulf Coast states of Louisiana, Mississippi and 
Alabama and reportedly left dozens of people dead.
</P>
<P>
German reinsurance giant Munich Re has estimated that Katrina 
could cost the world's insurers up to 20 billion dollars (16 billion 
euros).

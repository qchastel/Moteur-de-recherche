Russian natural gas monopoly Gazprom sees partnerships with Western energy
producers as key to its future, the deputy CEO said Thursday, citing cooperation
with German companies as successes while dismissing reports it was looking to
buy Scottish Power.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Medvedev told an energy forum in Berlin that he hoped increased
partnerships would gain OAO Gazprom better access to new markets.
</P>
<P>
"Gazprom intends to remain the leading gas supplier to Europe and expand sales
to industrial and commercial end customers in the European markets. Another
direction of Gazprom's strategy is expansion to new markets including the United
Kingdom, the United States and countries of the Asia-Pacific region," Medvedev
said. "Partnerships can help Gazprom obtain direct access to new target
markets."
</P>
<P>
Gazprom's pledge came at an awkward time, however, as new concerns were raised
about the company's ability to ensure steady fuel supplies. Countries including
Italy, Croatia and Hungary reported decreased supplies of Russian gas this week
as bitterly cold weather in Russia increased demand at home.
</P>
<P>
Russia's image already was damaged when a dispute with Ukraine around New Year's
decreased deliveries to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev stressed that Gazprom, which supplies a quarter of European Union gas
consumption, was in "full compliance with our contracts."
</P>
<P>
He also cited cooperation with Germany's BASF AG and E.On Ruhrgas, a unit of
E.On AG, on the planned construction of a new North European Gas Pipeline as an
example of a partnership success. He added Gazprom was still willing to take on
another partner in the project up until April, if the company was the right
fit.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need a formal partner, we need a partner that will bring something to
the project which we don't have today," Medvedev said on the sidelines of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the partnership with E.On is broadening, and that the companies are in
talks over cooperation in Hungary and on the Germany company's plan to take a
stake in Gazprom's Yuschno Russkoje gas field.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline being built by Gazprom, E.On Ruhrgas and BASF's Wintershall unit
will transport Siberian gas to northern Germany via international waters in the
Baltic after completion in 2010. There has been talk of extending the pipeline
to other European countries, including Great Britain, and Medvedev said Gazprom
was "monitoring what is going on in the British market."
</P>
<P>
Still, he dismissed speculation about Scottish Power. "We didn't look at
Scottish Power yet," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Italian oil and gas company Eni SpA said Thursday that it expects natural gas
supplies from Russia to Italy to be 12.2 percent below requested volumes in the
24 hours ending Friday morning. It said that gas supply from Russia in the
previous 24 hours fell 6.8 percent below requested volumes.
</P>
<P>
Though Medvedev stressed that Gazprom was in compliance with its contracts, he
conceded that there were times in cold weather when the company would not be
able to supply as much gas as during warmer months.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely we will stay within the framework of our contract agreements and try
to deliver as much gas as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom caused consternation earlier this month when its gas deliveries to
Europe fell sharply because of the price dispute with Ukraine, whose pipeline
network transits gas supplies to the rest of Europe _ a problem Medvedev said is
now solved.
</P>
<P>
"The major achievement of our agreement with Ukraine is that from Jan. 1 the
question of transit and the question of supply in Ukraine are ... now two
separate quarters, and that will never be changed," he said.

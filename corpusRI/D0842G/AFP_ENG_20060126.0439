 Croatia and Hungary are weighing 
construction of a gas pipeline from the Adriatic Sea to mainland 
Europe in order to decrease reliance on Russian gas, the prime 
ministers of the two central European countries said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project, which seeks to address recent disruptions in 
Russian gas supplies to Europe, calls for building a liquiefied 
petroleum gas (LPG) terminal at an Adriatic port and transporting 
the gas to central Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to build a terminal for liquiefied petroleum gas 
on the (Adriatic) coast, from which we can have pipelines reaching 
into Europe," Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany said at a 
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader, appearing alongside Gyurcsany, 
added:   "This is not only in the interest of Croatia, it is also 
for Hungary and we could extend this to other central and eastern 
European countries." 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned Austria and Slovakia in particular.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a price dispute between Russia and Ukraine, 
a major transit country for gas, affected supplies to Europe and 
pushed EU leaders to start thinking about alternative sources for 
gas.
</P>
<P>
The European Union imports more than 40 percent of its natural 
gas, and around half of that comes from Russia. Some parts of 
central and eastern Europe depend almost entirely on Russia for 
their gas supply.
</P>
<P>
"We think along the lines of Hungary, we really want to do 
everything in order to be independent in terms of energy," Sanader 
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Croatian government would next week hold the first 
committee level meeting on the project.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline would allow for a diversification of gas supply 
sources into Europe, notably by using liquid gas from North Africa 
and the Middle East, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Economy Minister Janos Koka earlier this month said a 
feasibility study for the pipeline could be completed by the end of 
March.

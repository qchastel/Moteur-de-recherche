Former German chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder was voted in Thursday as head of the supervisory board of 
a consortium that plans to build a natural gas pipeline under the 
Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, a company statement said.
</P>
<P>
The vote confirming Schroeder as the supervisory board's 
chairman was taken at the board's first meeting at Gazprom's 
headquarters in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"This pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at 
ensuring the security of gas supplies to Europe," Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the supervisory board include Gazprom chief 
executive Alexei Miller as well as officials from Germany's E.ON and 
BASF.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the North European Gas 
Pipeline, while BASF and E.ON hold 24.5 percent each.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom said Thursday that Gaz de France could also become a 
partner in the project.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's acceptance of the post less than a month after he 
left the chancellor's office last November prompted widespread 
criticism in Germany.
</P>
<P>
He and Russian President Vladimir Putin had worked closely on 
cementing German investment in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week he paid a visit to Gazprom production 
facilities in the Siberian province of Yamalo-Nenets.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline plan has prompted criticism from new EU members 
Lithuania and Poland, which complained that Schroeder had gone over 
their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through other 
Baltic countries' territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Work on the pipeline has already begun onshore in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian plan the pipeline will eventually connect not 
only to Germany but to other parts of western Europe, including the 
Netherlands, Sweden and Britain.

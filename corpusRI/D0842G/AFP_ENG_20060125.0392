The pipeline explosions that cut 
Georgia's and Armenia's gas supplies from Russia were an act of 
terror, the Russian prosecutor's office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into last Sunday's blasts initially centred on 
what the prosecutor's office said was "premeditated destruction of 
property" but was now focused on "terrorism" and the illegal use of 
explosives, Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Another investigation was looking into an explosion that 
targeted electricity cables crossing to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili has accused Moscow of 
organising the attacks. Russian authorities have so far announced no 
arrests or other progress in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at the height of an unusually harsh 
winter and also amid growing worries in Europe and along Russia's 
borders about over-reliance on Gazprom, the Russian natural gas 
colossus which controls a third of the world's reserves.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Russian engineers were still trying to repair the 
damage caused by the explosions to the pipeline to Georgia.

Russia's top energy official 
suggested here Wednesday that a US-backed pipeline project that 
would bypass Russia by linking Central Asia's gas fields directly 
with the West was premature.
</P>
<P>
Russian Industry and Energy Minister Viktor Khristenko said the 
undetermined borders of the Caspian Sea area would be a stumbling 
bloc for the project, which would cut Russia out of deals to 
transport Central Asian gas across its territory.
</P>
<P>
"Resolving the issue of a trans-Caspian system, including the 
construction of a pipeline, will be possible only after agreeing to 
a clear understanding of the status of the Caspian," Khristenko told 
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The proposed pipeline would link the vast gas reserves of 
Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to a yet-unfinished pipeline that will 
soon connect Azerbaijan's own gas deposits with Europe through 
Georgia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Top US officials dealing with the region have taken a different 
view of the project.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and 
Eurasian affairs, Matt Bryza, told AFP that it was up to the 
countries involved to decide whether the project should go ahead 
</P>
<P>
"Several feasibility studies have demonstrated the technical, 
environmental and economic feasibility of a trans-Caspian pipeline 
and it is up to the countries through which the pipeline would 
travel and the investors concerned to decide whether to proceed," 
Bryza said during a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Bryza added that Saparmurat Niyazov, the president of 
Turkmenistan, "showed interest in exploring the possibilities of the 
trans-Caspian pipeline, as well as other options," during a January 
meeting in Ashgabat.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan currently exports much of its oil through Russia's 
territory, but an alternative route through a new pipeline linking 
Baku with the Turkish port of Ceyhan is to open later this year.
</P>
<P>
"We understand these processes, we are trying to localize the 
risks," Khristenko said, adding that Russia transported 4.1 million 
tonnes of Azerbaijani crude through its Novorossiysk pipeline last 
year.

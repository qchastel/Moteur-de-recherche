Moscow, Baku at loggerheads over Caspian Sea gas pipeline

Russia and Azerbaijan clashed on 
Wednesday over plans to lay a major gas pipeline under the Caspian 
Sea, during a meeting of the five countries surrounding the sea.
</P>
<P>
"A major gas pipeline would pose a serious, dangerous risk to 
the prosperity of the entire region," senior Russian diplomat 
Alexander Golovine told Ria-Novosti news agency at the end of the 
meeting.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time Russia has opposed the project for 
the US-backed pipeline, which would bypass Russia by linking Central 
Asia's gas fields directly to the West and therefore cut Moscow out 
of gas transit deals between Central Asia and the West.
</P>
<P>
"The issue should be solved between all the countries around the 
Caspian, independently of the route chosen," Golovine said.
</P>
<P>
"The Caspian is a unique water source which must be treated 
carefully, including when it comes to pipeline installations."
</P>
<P>
Golovine was talking just days after Russia's Supreme Court 
backed plans for a major oil pipeline through an earthquake-prone 
region of Siberia that risks seriously polluting Lake Baikal, the 
world's biggest source of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan retorted by saying the construction of a gas pipeline 
across the bed of the Caspian should not pose a problem.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian side has submitted arguments but Azeri experts have 
provided demonstrations," Ria-Novosti quoted Baku's deputy foreign 
minister, Khalaf Khalafov, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The proposed pipeline would link the vast gas reserves of 
Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to an as yet unfinished pipeline taking 
Azerbaijan's gas deposits to western Europe through Georgia and 
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan currently exports much of its oil through Russian 
territory but an alternative pipeline linking Baku with the Turkish 
port of Ceyhan through the Georgian capital, Tbilissi, is due to 
come on stream later this year.
</P>
<P>
Laying a gas pipeline along that same route would enable 
Azerbaijan to transport gas from its promising Shah Deniz fields to 
eastern Turkey from 2007, while circumventing Russian territory.

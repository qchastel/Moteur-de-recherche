Russia's state-controlled gas monopoly, Gazprom, plans to complete a new US$6
billion (euro4.6 billion) natural gas pipeline to Western Europe in 2010, a
delay of three years from initial estimates, the Interfax news agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The pipeline will be launched in 2010," Interfax quoted Gazprom chief Alexei
Miller as telling German television after a meeting with German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder.

<P>
When Gazprom first unveiled the North European Gas Pipeline project in December
2002, Miller said the gas would start flowing first to continental Europe and
onward to Britain in 2007.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Miller said the pipeline would make it possible to increase Russian
gas supplies to Germany and other European Union countries, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer and a key supplier to Europe, has
begun design work on the onshore section. Much of pipeline will cross under the
Baltic Sea and make landfall in northern Germany before continuing through the
Netherlands and across the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom plans to tap the Yuzhno-Russkoye field in northern Siberia, to fill the
pipeline, which is to eventually export 20 billion-30 billion cubic meters (700
billion to 1 trillion cubic feet) of gas a year. Seismic work and construction
is currently being carried out at the field.

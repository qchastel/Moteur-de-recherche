RUSSIA RESTORES MOST GAS TO UKRAINE LINE

Faced with mounting criticism from its natural gas customers
across Western Europe, Russia on Monday restored most of the
gas it withheld from Ukraine's pipeline system a day earlier
in a pricing dispute.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state-owned Russian company, Gazprom, presented the decision not
as a reversal but as a response to Ukraine's "theft"
of natural gas. But it became clear that the driving
force in Russia's decision was the sharp criticism across Europe,
including countries that are usually reliable allies.
</P>
<P>
Within hours after Russia disrupted gas supplies on Sunday morning by
reducing pressure in the pipeline system, a cascading energy emergency
moved westward across Europe, as one utility after another reported
dropping gas pressures at a time of peak demand in
freezing weather.
</P>
<P>
As pressure continued to drop Monday, criticism erupted among European leaders,
jittery over the threat to one of the Continent's primary
sources of energy. The minister of economy in Germany, the
largest consumer of Russian natural gas in Europe, questioned Russia's
reliability as an energy supplier.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian officials, who had been gearing up for a national conservation
effort, greeted the decision to restore pressure to the pipelines
that came in a telegram from Russia at around 3
p.m. Monday. "We think common sense won," Irina Gerashchenko, the
spokeswoman for Ukraine's president, Viktor A. Yushchenko, said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's decision to choke off the westbound natural gas pipelines was
seen as a gamble by Moscow to influence Ukraine's internal
politics ahead of a parliamentary election in March, even though
Gazprom contended that it was motivated by business interests.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's energy troubles are far from over. Russia took other steps
on Monday that will limit Ukraine's other sources of natural
gas, and it was still unclear what Ukraine would eventually
pay for its gas. Both sides said negotiations would continue.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's fuel and energy minister, Ivan Plachkov, denied that the country
was siphoning gas for itself, a delicate issue for Ukraine,
which is a signer of the European Energy Charter, a
treaty that seeks to secure the flow of fuel across
borders. "There has been no unauthorized diversion of natural gas,"
he said.

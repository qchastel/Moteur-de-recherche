Construction of the Turkey-Greece natural gas pipeline is scheduled to start at
the beginning of July, Greek Development Minister Dimitris Sioufas said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 300-kilometer (186-mile) pipeline will run from Bursa in Turkey to Komotini
in Greece and is designed to transport Caspian and Central Asian natural gas to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the pipeline will transport 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas a year,
but this will rise to 11.5 billion cubic meters a year at a later stage, Sioufas
said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in capacity will take place once the pipeline is connected to two
other planned gas pipelines.
</P>
<P>
The first of these will run for 600 kilometers (373 miles) across northern
Greece from Komotini to the northwest Greek port of Stavrolimena, where it will
connect with a 220 kilometer (137-mile) long pipeline that will run under the
Ionian Sea to Italy.
</P>
<P>
The underwater section will be built by Greece's natural gas supplier Depa and
Italy's second-biggest power group Edison, and is expected to be completed by
2010.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is open to other investors. Turkish gas company Botas could
join the project, Edison said.
</P>
<P>
Construction of these two pipelines will be mainly funded by the European Union
as well as the Greek and Italian governments.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Sioufas and Italian Industry Minister Claudio Scajola signed the
protocol for the connection of the Greek and Italian natural gas
networks.
</P>
<P>
The pipelines are all part of the Southern Europe Gas Ring project, due to be
completed by end-2006.

KRAKOW, Poland, April 9

<P>
A monument to John Paul II was 
inaugurated Saturday at Rakowicki cemetery in Krakow, where the late 
pope's family are buried.
</P>
<P>
The 1.6-metre (five feet four inches) high bronze, by sculptor 
Czeslaw Dzwigaj, depicts the pope kneeling on a prie-dieu, or 
kneeling desk.
</P>
<P>
Dzwigaj finished the monument four years ago but Krakow city 
authorities decided at the time not to place it in the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
On his visits as pope to his native Poland, John Paul II often 
prayed at the family grave at Rakowicki cemetery, where his parents 
and elder brother Edmund are buried.
</P>
<P>
Monuments to the pope are to be erected in several cities and 
towns around Poland, including Wadowice in the south, where the pope 
was born Karol Wojtyla on May 18, 1920, and at Pilsudski Square in 
the capital, Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
Pilsudski Square was one of the high holy places in John Paul 
II's pontificate, as it was there that on June 10, 1979 he uttered 
the memorable phrase: "May the spirit come down and renew the face 
of this land."
</P>
<P>
Those words were interpreted by many Poles as an exhortation to 
stand up to the communist regime and allow a new Poland to be born.
</P>
<P>
John Paul II died on April 2 in his private apartment in the 
Vatican after a 26-year pontificate.

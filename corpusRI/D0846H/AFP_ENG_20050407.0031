Tireless pope said he wouldn't know where to tender a 
resignation

<P>
Pope John Paul II, who famously quipped 
that he would not know where to address a letter of resignation, 
revealed in his final testament that he considered stepping aside in 
2000.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that He will help me to recognize how long I must 
continue this service," the testament reads. "May the mercy of God 
give me the necessary strength for this service."
</P>
<P>
"According to the designs of Providence, I was given to live in 
the difficult century that is beginning to recede into the past," he 
wrote in March 2000.
</P>
<P>
"And now, in the year that will see my life reach the 80s, I 
must ask myself if the time has come to repeat with Simon in the 
Bible 'nunc dimittis'" -- the start of a phrase that translates as 
"Lord, lettest now Thy servant depart in peace according to Thy 
Word."
</P>
<P>
At the time, John Paul II's walk had begun to slow, his stoop 
was becoming more pronounced, and he was increasingly showing the 
symptoms of Parkinson's disease, which was already preventing him 
from speaking clearly on occasion.
</P>
<P>
The writing came two months after Karl Lehmann, the bishop of 
Mainz, Germany, sparked a row by intimating that John Paul II might 
consider stepping down if he felt that he could no longer carry out 
his duties, and that the Roman Catholic Church needed "a strong man, 
a leader."
</P>
<P>
John Paul II made what was seen as an indirect reference to the 
remarks when he said at the time: "God never asks us anything beyond 
our forces. He gives us the strength to accomplish what he expects 
from us."
</P>
<P>
But in a letter marking the UN International Old People's Year 
in 1999 he wrote: "In spite of the limits imposed by age, I still 
have a taste for life. I thank God for that."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the revelation, Cardinal Desmond Connell of 
Dublin told AFP on Thursday: "That doesn't surprise me at all. I 
would have expected John Paul II to be making provisions (for 
retirement).
</P>
<P>
"He knew his health was in decline and that there was a danger 
he would be unable to communicate."
</P>
<P>
The indefatigable John Paul II, who completed 104 foreign trips 
over his 26-year reign, would not have wanted to continue "if he 
would be unable to perform," Connell said. "He had a very profound 
sense of responsibility."
</P>
<P>
In the weeks leading up to the pope's death last Saturday, 
Connell said he was worried that John Paul II was becoming too 
incapacitated to continue serving.
</P>
<P>
"I was somewhat nervous about it, I have to say," he said, 
adding however that he had not discussed it with other cardinals.
</P>
<P>
The pope never fully recovered from the 1981 shooting by Turkish 
terrorist Ali Agca, who badly wounded him. By 2000, the pope had 
been hospitalized seven times since the start of his pontificate in 
1978, undergoing surgery for a benign colon tumor, a shoulder 
problem, a fractured hip and appendicitis.
</P>
<P>
A pope is elected for life, and only six of John Paul II's 262 
predecessors abdicated, the last one being Gregory XII in 1415. None 
resigned because of ill health.
</P>
<P>
John Paul II said repeatedly that he would continue to lead the 
Church until his "last breath" -- a vow he managed to honor, 
ironically, despite the severe respiratory problems that sparked his 
final decline.

Two federal judges warn more security needed in wake of murders

U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow told a newspaper Wednesday she fears
the murders of her husband and mother may have been related to her job, saying
she is furious over what she called a "cold-blooded" attack.
</P>
<P>
The judge's remarks came as police released sketches of two men seen near the
victims' home the day of the slayings, and as two of Lefkow's colleagues called
for greater security for federal judges and their families.
</P>
<P>
"If someone was angry at me, they should go after me. It's not fair to go after
my family," she said in an interview posted on the Web site of the Chicago
Sun-Times on Wednesday night. "It was just cold-blooded. Who would do this? I'm
just furious."
</P>
<P>
Chief of Detectives James Molloy described the two men in the sketches as
"persons of interest" whom police want to interview based on witness statements
from the neighborhood. One, a man in his mid-20s, was seen in a car near the
Lefkow home. The other, a man in his 50s, was wearing dark coveralls and a dark
knit cap. Both are white.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are hoping an abundance of physical evidence left behind in the
basement where the killings of Lefkow's husband, Michael, and her 89-year-old
mother, Donna Humphrey, occurred will point to specific suspects.
</P>
<P>
"This horrible tragedy has got to serve as the basis for a substantial increase
in security for judges and their families," U.S. District Judge Wayne R.
Andersen said. "The Internet is plastered with information about every one of
us."
</P>
<P>
The shootings came a month before white supremacist Matthew Hale was to be
sentenced by another judge for soliciting an undercover FBI informant to murder
Lefkow, who had ordered Hale to change the name of his extremist group as part
of a trademark lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Police say extremist groups are just one of several avenues being looked at by
authorities, though speculation among judges and lawyers about the killings has
focused on Hale's group, which has a history of violence.
</P>
<P>
Hale's father, retired East Peoria policeman Russell Hale, dismissed the notion
that his son was involved in the slayings, saying he is under constant
surveillance and the FBI closely monitors his phone calls and visits with family
members.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investigators are hoping that an abundance of physical evidence left
behind in the basement where the victims were killed will point to specific
suspects.
</P>
<P>
Both victims had been shot multiple times, according to the Cook County Medical
Examiner's office, and a source told the AP that police found two .22 caliber
casings at the scene. Investigators believe the victims were forced to lie on
the basement floor before being shot, the Chicago Tribune reported Wednesday,
citing unnamed sources.
</P>
<P>
A federal source who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity said a shard of
broken glass from a broken window in the Lefkow home contained a fingerprint and
was flown to Washington for examination. The source said police also were
analyzing a bloody footprint left at the home.
</P>
<P>
There are many marshals and other law officers in federal courthouses to provide
protection for judges and others. But judges get no special protection once they
leave the courthouse unless a specific threat arises.
</P>
<P>
Lefkow received special protection for about two weeks after Hale's arrest in
2003, but it was then withdrawn with her concurrence, said Shannon Metzger, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals' office. Metzger said Wednesday that the
office was studying Andersen's comments.
</P>
<P>
Lefkow and other members of her family have been in seclusion since the
killings, guarded by a special protective detail of federal marshals. But other
judges in the courthouse have been coming and going without special
security.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Marvin E. Aspen also called for more protection.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is an increased need and awareness because there are people who
are interested in attacking the very fabric of our democratic society," Aspen
said.
</P>
<P>
Laura Lefkow, the 20-year-old daughter of Joan and Michael Lefkow, said in an
e-mail to the AP on Wednesday that her father was a true gentleman. As an
attorney, he "worked for the voiceless, those who were unemployed, poor and
marginalized," she said.
</P>
<P>
She remembered her grandmother as a woman "who could do the Sunday crossword
puzzle in pen" and hand-made quilts for each of her children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren.

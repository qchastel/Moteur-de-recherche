The man believed to have killed a federal judge's husband and mother typed out a
suicide letter two weeks before the shootings and included a hit list of judges,
lawyers and doctors, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bart Ross, 57, an unemployed electrician, committed suicide March 9 in his van
in a Milwaukee suburb. In the van, police and federal agents found the letter in
which he implicated himself in the Feb. 28 murders of Michael Lefkow, 64, the
husband of U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow, and the judge's mother, Donna
Humphrey, 89.
</P>
<P>
"When you read this I should be dead, so I am writing in past tense," he wrote
in the four-page letter obtained by the Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
The typed letter, dated Feb. 13, was found along with a handwritten account of
the Lefkow killings, the newspaper said. The account detailed how he was hiding
in the Lefkows' basement when Michael Lefkow discovered him and how he killed
both victims. He expressed regret for killing Lefkow and Humphrey because "they
personally did to me no wrong," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
The letter declared Ross a victim of medical malpractice and contained a hit
list of seven federal judges, four state judges, 10 lawyers and five doctors,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Ross, a heavy smoker, was treated for cancer of the mouth from 1992 to 1995.
Surgery and radiation saved his life but disfigured his face, and Ross set out
through the court system trying to make his doctors pay for what they'd done.
Lefkow had dismissed the most recent of his repeated lawsuits last
year.

<P>
"I was left with no possibility to live my life, but to progressively suffer
more and more, so like those who jumped down from the WTC Towers on September
11, 2001, I 'jumped' too. On the way, I intended to send to Hell as many of the
listed (expletive) as I was lucky to get," Ross wrote, according to the
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
"I am not a murderer," he wrote in the letter. "The murderers are the listed
(expletive), who violated me like Nazis and terrorists and deprived me justice
and compensation to put my life in order, and in this way deprived me
possibility of salvaging my life."
</P>
<P>
Nine days after the Lefkows were killed, a police officer in West Allis, Wis.
stopped the van Ross was driving because a taillight was broken, and Ross shot
himself in the head.
</P>
<P>
Hours earlier, a parking ticket was issued for his minivan about four blocks
from a federal courthouse in Milwaukee where two federal judges who upheld
dismissals of Ross' lawsuits have offices. One of the judges was on Ross' hit
list, the Tribune reported.
</P>
<P>
Ross ended his suicide letter saying he wanted to cause pain to everyone on his
list.
</P>
<P>
"I regret that I cannot torture this (expletive) the way they tortured me for
over 12 1/2 years and I regret that I cannot at least send them all to Hell," he
wrote.

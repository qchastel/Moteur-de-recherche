FBI AGENTS SEIZE LETTERS FROM SUPREMACIST'S FRIEND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Confined to his cell 23 hours a
day, Matthew Hale sings opera loud enough for neighboring inmates
to join in. He is studying Latin and reading everything
from the Federal Rules of Procedure to Agatha Christie.
</P>
<P>
He slid into depression last fall, taking Prozac, but said he
was buoyed when the adjacent cell was filled by a
man with the same name as Hitler's boyhood friend.
</P>
<P>
These and other tidbits about Hale, the Aryan leader convicted last
year of plotting to kill a federal judge whose mother
and husband were slain this week, are in the cache
of letters federal agents seized here on Thursday from the
home of Kathleen Robertazzo, his frequent correspondent.
</P>
<P>
Robertazzo, a friend of five years who shares Hale's racial views,
said that the authorities took 100 of his letters, written
in pencil on yellow legal paper, and made copies of
her computer hard drive, promising to search her e-mail for
secret messages to supporters.
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't really talk about his case -- I told him
you have to stop, woulda coulda shoulda, it's over," Robertazzo,
53, said in an interview. "We like to talk about
history. He loves the Roman Empire. I send him jokes
to keep his spirits up, famous one-line pickups and stuff
and just things to make him laugh.
</P>
<P>
"We both like classical music," she added. "He found a Chicago
station that has classical music. He tells me, 'Listen to
it at 7:30, and I'll be listening.' "
</P>
<P>
Hale, 33, has emphatically denied any involvement in the killings, but
the pressure on him has risen exponentially this week, as
he faces an April 6 sentencing amid mounting sympathy for
the judge he was convicted of conspiring to kill.
</P>
<P>
The FBI offered a reward on Friday of up to $50,000
for information in the case, which is to be profiled
Saturday on the "America's Most Wanted" television show and has
been part of President Bush's morning briefing each day this
week. While the Chicago police said they were investigating 271
tips that poured into a hot line by 5 p.m.
Friday -- including 141 that followed the release of composite
sketches of two white men seen near the judge's home
-- Hale and his sympathizers clearly remain a focus of
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
After interviewing her for about 90 minutes on Tuesday, Robertazzo said,
federal agents returned to her home in this northwest suburb
of Chicago the next night at 8 with state and
local police officers -- and a subpoena. She said they
stayed until 5:30 a.m. Thursday, mainly working on the computer,
but also quizzing her about her whereabouts Monday, when Judge
Joan Humphrey Lefkow of U.S. District Court returned to her
Chicago home to find the bodies of her husband and
mother.
</P>
<P>
Robertazzo said agents also asked about her familiarity with the Lefkows'
neighborhood and the color of her car. It is red,
like the Ford Escort said to have been spotted at
the crime scene, but a Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
"One kept putting his hand on his gun; I felt like
such a suspect," Robertazzo said of the agents. "They asked
if I recognized any of those two composites."
</P>
<P>
When she went to the bathroom and sat for a minute
to collect her thoughts, Robertazzo said, an agent asked, "
'How long are you going to be up there?' It's
like they were worried I was going to get a
weapon and come out shooting."
</P>
<P>
Robertazzo, a freelance court reporter, said she first contacted Hale, the
self-described Pontifex Maximus of the World Church of the Creator,
by e-mail in 1999, amid public debate over the Illinois
bar's decision to reject him even though he had passed
the bar exam. He invited her to meet him at
O'Hare International Airport during a four-hour layover the next year,
and she took him to speak at the public library
here in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Now, Robertazzo sends him postcards with pictures of animals every other
day, and they exchange one or two lengthy letters a
week.
</P>
<P>
Though she has been described by those who monitor hate groups
as Hale's "middle-aged mistress," Robertazzo said their relationship was platonic."It
was suggested by Matt," she said. "I told him it
would be incest. We never acted on it."
</P>
<P>
Robertazzo's comments, and the material she gave the authorities, provide the
fullest picture yet of the prison life of Hale, who
first encountered Lefkow when she presided over a trademark-infringement lawsuit
in which an Oregon group tried to block him from
using the World Church name. Lefkow ruled in Hale's favor
and dismissed the case. But her ruling was overturned on
appeal, and she later held him in contempt.
</P>
<P>
The judge was vilified on pro-white Web sites, and Hale was
soon arrested for plotting her murder with an FBI informant
who had infiltrated his group.
</P>
<P>
"This defies logic that he had any animosity towards Lefkow, she
ruled in his favor -- it's the 7th Circuit Court
of Appeals," Robertazzo said, adding that Hale's main complaint these
days is about his former lawyer's decisions. "Judge Lefkow is
old news. If his people were going to target anybody,
it would be his attorney. Matt's venom right now is
with the FBI."
</P>
<P>
Robertazzo said that her own racial views were rooted in her
rape, at 13, by a black man. "I don't want
to live with blacks," she said. "We have safe communities,
they move in, and they bring the crime with them."
</P>
<P>
But, she added, "I don't hate all black people, I don't
hate all Jews," and she said that "white supremacy is
a misnomer."
</P>
<P>
"Matt is a separationist, I'm a separationist," she explained. "White supremacy
sounds more ominous. Supremacy means you want to rule over
somebody."
</P>
<P>
Since his arrest in January 2003, Hale has been held at
the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago under special administrative measures
that severely restrict his communication with the outside world. His
only permitted visitors are his parents, who get an hour
each, every other week. Many of his supporters have been
cut off from contact completely after sending letters with white-power
symbols, or posting his replies on the Internet, so Robertazzo
keeps her correspondence more personal than political.
</P>
<P>
She sends him famous quotations from George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
He writes "that the founding fathers would be disappointed in
the country we're living in," she said. Sometimes, she said,
she closes with a "message to your enemies: hope your
penal implants malfunction," but that typically gets cut out by
censors.
</P>
<P>
The only gifts he is allowed, Robertazzo said, are paperback books.
So she has sent him philosophy by Nietzsche, "The Time
Machine" by H.G. Wells, a history of Pearl Harbor, the
Agatha Christie mysteries, anything in Latin and, most recently, the
1.7-pound Rules of Procedure.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Robertazzo said that Hale "was starving" when his breakfasts of two
hard-boiled eggs and two boxes of cereal, and lunch of
a tuna salad stuffed green pepper, was cut in half
because of budget problems, and that he had been fighting
the flu.
</P>
<P>
She said that, despite his atheism, Hale at one point "prayed
to God he wanted to die," and "felt this warm
wave of peace go through his body." Soon after, she
said he told her, he found the words "I love
Matt Hale" etched in wood paneling at the prison, and
someone named Kubizek (like Hitler's boyhood friend August Kubizek), moved
into the next cell -- though the Metropolitan Correctional Center
has no record of such a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
"Matt thought, 'Oh my God, this is all these signs I'm
supposed to keep going,"' Robertazzo recalled of his letters. "He
came back from the dead with those three little revelations.
It's amazing."
</P>
<P>
Robertazzo said she "has nothing to hide." All the authorities will
find on her hard drive, she added, was a "rant
and rave about he's being railroaded."
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
Robertazzo said that she happily provided the letters, since the government
already makes photocopies of everything Hale sends, but that she
hopes to get back the originals, which she kept in
her office, ordered by date, secured by a rubber band.

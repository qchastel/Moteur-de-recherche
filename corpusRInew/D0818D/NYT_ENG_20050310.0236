SUICIDE NOTE CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR KILLING OF JUDGE'S KIN

An out-of-work electrician whose delusional, decade-long legal crusade against
doctors, lawyers and the government was dismissed last year by
a federal judge killed himself Wednesday night, leaving behind letters
in which he admitted murdering the judge's husband and mother
here last week.

Bart A. Ross, 57, had sued the federal government and a
raft of others for $1 billion, saying they persecuted him
with "Nazi-style" and terrorist tactics as he pursued a medical
malpractice claim stemming from the severe disfigurement of his cancerous
jaw. He left a suicide note in the van where
he had been living, confessing to the crime, and, in
a letter to a local television station, said he had
planned to assassinate the judge, Joan Humphrey Lefkow of U.S.
District Court, but "had no choice but to shoot" her
loved ones when they discovered him hiding in the basement.

Along with the confessional suicide note, the police said they found
some 300 .22-caliber bullets, the same caliber used in the
execution-style slayings, in the Plymouth van where Ross, who had
no criminal record, shot himself in the head after being
stopped in a Milwaukee suburb for a missing taillight. Though
the authorities said they would not consider the case closed
until they could tie Ross, through fingerprints and DNA, to
physical evidence left at the scene, his death and admissions
were a shocking turn in a vast investigation that had
thus far focused on white supremacists.

<P>
Chicago Police Superintendent Philip J. Cline said Thursday that Ross' name
was on a list of people, culled from Lefkow's caseload,
that investigators planned to interview. He also said Ross resembled
one of two composite sketches released two days after the
deaths, and that his account of leaving the Lefkows' home
at 1:15 p.m. on Feb. 28 matched witness reports.

<P>
Lefkow, who expressed "sincere empathy" for Ross in legal papers even
as she said his claims "lack any possible merit," described
him in an interview early Thursday as "a very pathetic,
tragic person" and said the news was "very chilling."
</P>
<P>
"I guess on one level I'm relieved that it didn't have
anything to do with the white supremacy movement, because I
feel my children are going to be safer," Lefkow said
as she departed for Denver to bury her mother, Donna
Humphrey. "It's heartbreaking that my husband and mother had to
die over something like this."

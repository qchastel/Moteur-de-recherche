MAN IN PLOT TO KILL JUDGE SAYS HE DIDN'T ORDER DEATH OF HER RELATIVES

<P>
Matthew Hale, the white supremacist convicted last year of
plotting to kill a federal judge, sent a statement through
his mother on Thursday condemning the murder of the judge's
husband and mother as a "heinous crime" that he had
nothing to do with.
</P>
<P>
Hale's mother, Evelyn Hutcheson, said her son also told her, in
their weekly 15-minute telephone call, that he was moved to
a different cell after the slayings were discovered on Monday
and that FBI agents had visited the Metropolitan Correctional Center
in Chicago to question him and nearby prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"There's simply no way that any supporter of mine would commit
such a heinous crime," Hutcheson read from the statement, which
she said Hale had written before calling his parents. "I
totally condemn it, and I want the perpetrator caught and
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
"I only hope they seriously want to apprehend the animal instead
of railroading the innocent," his statement continued. "Only an idiot
would think I would do this. My sentencing date is
April 6."
</P>
<P>
Hale, 33, faces up to 40 years in prison for two
counts of obstruction of justice and one of soliciting his
security chief to assassinate U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow.
In 2002, Lefkow had ordered him to pay $200,000 for
violating an Oregon group's trademark on the name World Church
of the Creator. He is representing himself and is being
held under special measures, reserved for terrorists, that restrict his
contact with the outside world, allowing only his parents to
visit him, each for an hour, every other week.
</P>
<P>
"He sounded sad, he's worried, frantic, scared -- so many things,"
Hutcheson said, adding that Hale has no television but was
monitoring news of the killings through radio. "They've taken him
out of his cell where he is working his case.
All of his books and papers have been taken away
from him after this."
</P>
<P>
Lefkow found her husband, Michael F. Lefkow, 64, and her mother,
Donna Humphrey, 89, shot to death in their basement when
she returned home from work on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lefkow had an extra security detail during Hale's trial last year,
but it was disbanded after a couple of weeks.

Authorities Seek Killers of Judge's Husband, Mother

<P>
A task force of federal agents and Chicago police
detectives fanned out Tuesday through a residential neighborhood,
searching for clues in the shooting deaths of the husband and mother
of a federal judge who had been targeted for murder by a white
supremacist group.
</P>
<P>
Authorities placed U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow under
around-the-clock guard after she returned home from work Monday and
found the bodies of Michael F. Lefkow, 64, and Donna Humphrey, 89.
</P>
<P>
The victims apparently were killed in the basement, where
investigators reportedly recovered two .22-caliber shell casings. Jim
Molloy, Chicago's chief of detectives, said the slayings occurred
between 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Autopsies conducted Tuesday by Cook County medical examiners
confirmed that the victims died from multiple gunshot wounds.
Officials said some evidence removed from the Lefkow home would be
flown to the FBI's forensics laboratory in Quantico, Va., for
analysis.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they were not ruling out any possibilities, but
were taking a hard look at any involvement by domestic extremist
groups.
</P>
<P>
``There's nothing pointing us in that direction,'' said David
Bayless, spokesman for the Chicago Police Department. ``However, we're
actively pursuing that.''
</P>
<P>
Police said that deadly home invasions do not fit the community
profile in Edgewater, a north-side Chicago neighborhood of stylish
brick and wood-frame houses where the Lefkows lived for nearly 20
years.
</P>
<P>
The FBI was drawn into the case because killing relatives of a
federal judge is classified as a federal crime, punishable either by
the death penalty or life imprisonment. But the statute can only be
invoked if the killing was an attempt to impede or retaliate against
the judge.
</P>
<P>
``The crime has to be aimed at affecting a judge's official
duties,'' said Scott Mendeloff, who helped lead a team of federal
prosecutors in the conviction of Timothy J. McVeigh for the 1995
Oklahoma City federal building bombing.
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department official in Washington confirmed Tuesday that
FBI agents were ``looking at any possible connection related to any
case that the judge has handled. There's a clear history there. But we
haven't excluded any scenarios either.''
</P>
<P>
White supremacist leader Matthew Hale, 33, was found guilty in
April 2004 of soliciting someone to murder Judge Lefkow. He is
scheduled to be sentenced next month.
</P>
<P>
Lefkow, 61, had been singled out by Hale and his followers after
she presided over a civil case in which his group -- World Church of
the Creator -- was sued by a similarly named group for copyright
infringement.
</P>
<P>
Lefkow initially had ruled that Hale could keep the name. But a
federal appeals court reversed her, and in November 2002 she told Hale
that she had no choice but to order him to stop using World Church of
the Creator on his Web site and in all printed material.
</P>
<P>
Hale's backers railed against the judge and her family in Internet
messages, even posting their photographs and address.
</P>
<P>
``She and her family were singled out for demonization. Law
enforcement clearly has a lot to look at there,'' said Devin Burghart,
who monitors white supremacist groups for the Center for New
Community, a Chicago-based activist organization.
</P>
<P>
Friends of the Lefkows said that the judge and her husband, a
veteran labor lawyer, endured monitoring by security cameras and
federal undercover teams during Hale's murder solicitation trial.
</P>
<P>
``They both handled it courageously,'' said Thomas F. Geraghty, an
associate dean at Northwestern University Law School and a close
acquaintance.
</P>

</P>
<P>
At the height of the Hale trial, the Lefkows cheerily ignored the
cameras during dinner parties and refused to cut back on nightly
strolls through the neighborhood, recalled Michael Miner, a senior
editor with the Chicago Reader newspaper. A U.S. marshal's official
said Tuesday that the cameras were removed after only a few weeks --
with the judge's approval.
</P>
<P>
Miner recalled Michael Lefkow as an ``intense and idealistic''
attorney who branched out from a poverty law practice into employment
cases and mediation in recent years. He ran twice for county judge,
but was unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
Judge Lefkow was a late entrant in the saga of Hale and his World
Church of the Creator -- the extremist group he founded to espouse a
doctrine of ``racial holy war.'' In 1999, Benjamin Smith, a
``Creativity'' adherent, went on a serial shooting spree on Chicago's
north side, killing two people and wounding nine others.
</P>
<P>
Hale was not linked to those shootings.
</P>
<P>
But after the judge ordered World Church of the Creator to change
its name and imposed $200,000 in sanctions, Hale approached one of his
aides and urged the judge's murder. The aide was an FBI informant, and
his conversations with Hale were secretly recorded.
</P>
<P>
Hale's group ``is pretty much splintered now,'' Burghart said. But
he cautioned that white supremacist ``lone wolves'' were capable of
committing violence without direction.

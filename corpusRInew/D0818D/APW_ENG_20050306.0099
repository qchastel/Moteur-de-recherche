Security tight at funeral for judge's slain husband; officials seize letters written by white supremacist

<P>
As scores of police officers stood guard, hundreds of mourners filled a church
Saturday to bid farewell to a federal judge's slain husband, less than a week
after the judge discovered his body in their home, along with that of her
mother.
</P>
<P>
Mourners filed slowly past the casket of attorney Michael Lefkow, his trademark
gray fedora resting on top. They remembered that he would sometimes show up at
the federal courthouse to take his wife, U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey
Lefkow, to lunch and brought her flowers. The couple often held
hands.
</P>
<P>
The family has been in protective custody since the judge discovered the bodies
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
FBI officials have said they do not have a suspect. They have asked for the
public's help and offered a $50,000 (euro38,124) reward to shake loose
information.
</P>
<P>
FBI Agent Robert D. Grant said one avenue of investigation was white supremacist
Matthew Hale and his associates.
</P>
<P>
Hale, 33, faces sentencing next month for soliciting an FBI informant to kill
Lefkow after she ruled against him in a trademark lawsuit. He has denied any
involvement in the slayings, which he called "a heinous crime."
</P>
<P>
Judge Lefkow and the couple's children greeted people arriving at St. Luke's
Episcopal Church for a 90-minute service that was conducted under tight
security. Several of the daughters cried, but Lefkow appeared to comfort some
mourners.
</P>
<P>
More than two dozen police and federal marshals were outside the church, and the
line to enter stretched down the block. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, Chicago
Police Superintendent Phil Cline and a number of federal judges were
present.
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for Judge Lefkow's mother, 89-year-old Donna Humphrey, were
expected to take place in Denver.
</P>
<P>
A friend of Hale's, Kathleen Robertazzo, told The New York Times and Chicago
Tribune in Saturday's editions that authorities seized 100 letters Hale sent her
from prison and made copies of her computer hard drive.
</P>
<P>
Robertazzo told the Times the idea that Hale would be involved "defies logic."
In the letters, she said, Hale describes singing opera in jail, taking Prozac
and being buoyed by the presence of a man with the same name as Adolf Hitler's
boyhood friend.
</P>
<P>
Humphrey and Lefkow's 64-year-old husband had been shot multiple times,
according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
Experts are analyzing several pieces of evidence, including a broken window with
a fingerprint, a bloody footprint and cigarette butts. Investigators released
composite sketches Wednesday night of two men seen near the Lefkow home the day
of the killings.

<P>
Rep. Randy Cunningham, a Republican from San Diego,
resigned from Congress on Monday, hours after pleading guilty to
taking at least $2.4 million in bribes to help friends
and campaign contributors win defense contracts.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, a highly decorated Navy fighter pilot in Vietnam, tearfully acknowledged
his guilt in a statement read outside the federal courthouse
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, I broke the law, concealed my conduct and
disgraced my office," the eight-term congressman known for his emotional
outbursts and combative conservatism said. "I know that I will
forfeit my freedom, my reputation, my worldly possessions and, most
importantly, the trust of my friends and family."
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, 63, pleaded guilty to one count of tax evasion and
one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, tax evasion, wire
fraud and mail fraud. He faces up to 10 years
in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines
and forfeitures.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said he received cash, cars, rugs, antiques, furniture, yacht club
fees, moving expenses and vacations from four unnamed co-conspirators in
exchange for aid in winning defense contracts. None of this
income was reported to the Internal Revenue Service or on
the congressman's financial disclosure forms, the government said.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, who is known as Duke, lived while in Washington on
a 42-foot yacht, named the Duke-Stir, owned by Mitchell J.
Wade, the founder of MZM Inc., a defense contracting firm
that received tens of millions of dollars in federal contracts
that prosecutors said Cunningham helped steer its way.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham served on the defense subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee
and as chairman of the House Intelligence subcommittee on terrorism
and human intelligence.
</P>
<P>
"He did the worst thing an elected official can do," Carol
C. Lam, the U.S. attorney, said in a statement. "He
enriched himself through his position and violated the trust of
those who put him there."
</P>
<P>
Under California law, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has 14 days to call
a special election to fill Cunningham's seat. The election must
occur within 120 days.

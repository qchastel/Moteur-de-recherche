Prosecutors asked that former Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham be sentenced to the
maximum of 10 years in prison for his "stunning betrayal of the public trust" by
accepting bribes.
</P>
<P>
"Cunningham used his status as a war hero to get into Congress, and then he used
his Congressional office to get rich," prosecutors wrote in a sentencing
memorandum issued Friday. "For the better part of a decade, Cunningham, in
effect, erected a 'for sale' sign upon our nation's capital."
</P>
<P>
The former Vietnam War flying ace and "Top Gun" Navy flight instructor is to be
sentenced March 3 in federal court in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
The Cunningham case is one of several scandals involving Republican lawmakers
that have left the party nervous about midterm elections in November that could
return control Congress to Democrats. The investigation of lobbyist Jack
Abramoff threatens to ensnare several members of Congress, and Rep. Tom DeLay,
the former House Majority Leader, faces trial in Texas on money laundering
charges.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, 64, resigned from Congress in November after pleading guilty to
accepting $2.4 million in bribes _ including a Rolls-Royce, yachts, homes and
antique furnishings _ in exchange for defense contracts and other
favors.
</P>
<P>
At the time, President George W. Bush criticized Cunningham, saying "the idea of
a congressman taking money is outrageous." Bush said the former congressman
should "pay a serious price" for breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's attorney Lee Blalack said he would recommend a six-year sentence.
Because of his age and history of prostate cancer, 10 years "is essentially a
sentence of death," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Given his contribution to this country and the community of San Diego,
notwithstanding his admitted wrongdoing, such a sentence is grossly excessive,"
Blalack said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also asked U.S. District Court Judge Larry Burns to order Cunningham
to pay the nearly $1.6 million (euro1.35 million) he owes in taxes and forfeit
his interest in his 7,628-square-foot (687-square-meter) mansion in Rancho Santa
Fe, one of America's wealthiest communities. The home sold in December for $2.6
million (euro2.2 million).
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's memo contained a copy of a "bribe menu" written under the
congressional seal on Cunningham's office stationery. One column of figures
represented the millions of dollars in contracts that could be "ordered" from
Cunningham, according to prosecutors. The other column showed the amount of
bribes Cunningham demanded in return.
</P>
<P>
According to the sentencing memorandum, Cunningham offered co-conspirator No. 2
_ identified elsewhere as defense contractor Mitchell Wade _ $16 million in
contracts in exchange for a $140,000 bribe, which came in the form of a 42-foot
(12.6-meter) yacht, named the "Duke-Stir."
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's position on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
put him in a position to help Wade, founder of defense contractor MZM Inc. MZM's
government contracts soared from less than $1 million a year to tens of millions
of dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
Besides Wade, three other co-conspirators were named in Cunningham's plea
agreement. They were identified elsewhere as Brent Wilkes, founder of San
Diego-based ADCS Inc.; New York businessman Thomas Kontogiannis; and John T.
Michael, Kontogiannis' nephew.
</P>
<P>
In his Nov. 28 plea agreement, Cunningham admitted to accepting a Rolls-Royce,
yachts, homes and antique furnishings, including a 19th Century Louis-Phillipe
commode.
</P>
<P>
The sentencing memorandum provides a more complete catalogue of the bribes he
received, including private jet flights and stays at top-of-the-line resorts and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
"Cunningham grew to expect luxury," prosecutors wrote. "His co-conspirators
eagerly plied him with it."

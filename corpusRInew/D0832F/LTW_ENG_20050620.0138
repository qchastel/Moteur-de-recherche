Subpoena Creates Stir for Embattled Congressman
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Randall ``Duke'' Cunningham, R-Calif., caused a
stir Monday by having the clerk of the House of Representatives
announce that his office has been subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
The routine subpoena was not related to the ongoing federal
investigation into the sale of Cunningham's San Diego home to a
defense industry executive, but that was not part of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Besieged by calls from reporters, Cunningham's office later said
the subpoena involved a resident from Imperial County who had sought
the congressman's help dealing with a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
At issue in the federal probe is the November 2003 sale of
Cunningham's home in the Del Mar Heights neighborhood to Mitchell
Wade, president and chief executive of MZM, for $1,675,000. A month
later, Wade put the house on the market where it remained for seven
months before he sold it for $975,000, a $700,000 loss.
</P>
<P>
Profits from the November 2003 sale allowed Cunningham and his
wife, Nancy, to buy a much larger home in nearby Rancho Santa Fe for
$2.55 million.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham was not accessible to reporters on Monday -- a stance he
has taken since the home sale became public a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Imperial County Superior Court said the subpoena
was part of a civil lawsuit against the county government by a man who
alleged he was roughed up by Bureau of Land Management agents while in
Glamis, a popular spot for dune buggy enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
The man's father, like Cunningham, is a former Navy aviator. He
asked for help from Cunningham, who inquired of BLM about the
incident. Now the case has become a civil lawsuit and the man is
seeking correspondence between BLM and Cunningham's office.
</P>
<P>
House members are required to announce when their offices have been
received subpoenas. When Cunningham's announcement did not specify the
nature of the subpoena, reporters assumed it related to the home sale.
</P>
<P>
The bicoastal buzz is an indication of how intense the scrutiny
Cunningham has become as federal authorities probe the circumstances
surrounding the home sale to see if it was an effort by the executive
to repay Cunningham for his support in gaining federal contracts.
</P>
<P>
Back in his district in northern San Diego County, critics of the
home sale are writing angry letters to local newspapers and picketing
Cunningham's new home in Rancho Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
Citizens For Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a national
political watchdog group, filed a Freedom of Information Act request
Monday with the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland
Security to see what contacts Cunningham has made on behalf of the
company, MZM Inc.

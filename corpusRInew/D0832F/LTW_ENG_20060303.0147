Congressman Gets 8 Years in Bribery Case

<P>
A federal judge sentenced disgraced ex-congressman
Randall ``Duke'' Cunningham on Friday to eight years and four months
in prison for taking bribes and evading taxes, considered the harshest
penalty delivered to a former member of Congress in a corruption case.
</P>
<P>
``What you did was aggravated in scope, duration and nature,'' U.S.
District Court Judge Larry Alan Burns told a haggard-looking
Cunningham. ``The word `avarice' is an antiquated word. But I think it
applies here.''
</P>
<P>
Cunningham had admitted taking $2.4 million in bribes from defense
contractors and evading more than $1 million in taxes. On Friday, with
his voice breaking, the former decorated naval pilot asked the federal
judge for mercy and mentioned his record as a war hero.
</P>
<P>
Burns said he would have sentenced the 64-year-old Republican to 10
years in prison, as requested by prosecutors, but concluded that a
measure of leniency was appropriate because of Cunningham's service in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
After hearing arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys,
Burns said he agreed with the prosecution that a long sentence would
send a warning to future politicians not to misuse their offices for
private gain.
</P>
<P>
But he then said, ``Yes, send a message to politicians, but another
message should be sent for service to country.''
</P>
<P>
Under a plea agreement reached in November, prosecutors agreed not
to seek more than a 10-year sentence. They could have pressed for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's attorneys had recommended a six-year sentence, citing
Cunningham's war record, age, declining health and lack of a criminal
record.
</P>
<P>
Federal prisoners are generally eligible for parole after serving
85 percent of their sentences, or seven years and one month for
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
Burns also ordered Cunningham to pay $1.8 million in restitution
and rejected his request to remain free long enough to say goodbye to
his 91-year-old mother and his estranged wife.
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered Cunningham into custody and recommended that he
be sent to the minimum-security prison in Taft, about 30 miles
southwest of Bakersfield. The federal Bureau of Prisons will decide
where Cunningham will serve his time.
</P>
<P>
In a bid for a lesser sentence, Cunningham told the judge about his
war record. He shot down five enemy planes -- three on one day -- and
received the Navy Cross, the Navy's second-highest medal for bravery.
</P>
<P>
``I didn't jump into a pack of MiGs for ego,'' he said in a
trembling voice, looking at prosecutors. ``I did it because it was the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had urged Burns to ignore Cunningham's war record,
saying his heroism was ``three decades ago.''
</P>
<P>
But Burns noted that, while he himself had a high draft number and
avoided military service during ``an unpopular war,'' Cunningham had
volunteered and served with distinction in combat and later as a
flight instructor at the Top Gun school in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham was accompanied into court by Rep. Duncan Hunter,
R-Calif., a friend and a fellow Vietnam veteran.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors called the sentence the longest ever handed down in a
congressional corruption case and historians said the bribe was the
largest.
</P>
<P>
``No one can serve the public and his own greed at the same time,''
U.S. Attorney Carol Lam said in a statement. ``Mr. Cunningham failed
his office, his colleagues and his nation.''
</P>
<P>
The plea agreement, which forced Cunningham to resign, provided a
detailed list of payoffs, including cash, sweetheart real estate
deals, antiques, trips, use of a yacht, a deal on a Rolls Royce and
jewelry for his wife. The bribes from four unnamed co-conspirators
came in exchange for Cunningham using his influence to arrange
lucrative defense contracts for high-tech equipment for intelligence
gathering and analysis.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors portrayed Cunningham as the mastermind of the bribery
scheme, noting that he kept a ``bribe menu'' on congressional
stationery indicating how much he demanded in exchange for contracts.
</P>
<P>
They charged that he ``bullied and hectored'' Pentagon bureaucrats
to approve deals for contractors Mitchell Wade and Brent Wilkes,
including threatening to get one bureaucrat fired and ignoring a
warning from one official that $700,000 in bills from Wilkes' company
seemed fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's fall from prominence was swift. He represented a
Republican district in the affluent suburbs of Northern San Diego
County, had never encountered a close re-election race and was a key
GOP fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
But in June, the Copley News Service's Washington bureau reported
that Wade had paid what appeared to be an inflated price for
Cunningham's home in Del Mar Heights. The sale allowed Cunningham and
his wife, Nancy, to buy a mansion in swank Rancho Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
Three months before the story broke, Cunningham's chief of staff in
Washington had abruptly, but quietly, quit.
</P>
<P>
The aide had recognized the sale price of the house as a bribe and
a year earlier had advised Cunningham to resign or at least not run
for re-election, a warning that Cunningham angrily ignored, according
to federal prosecutors. He was re-elected in November 2004 to an
eighth term.
</P>
<P>
Once the article appeared, federal prosecutors launched an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Wade, the contractor who bought the Del Mar Heights house, pleaded
guilty last month to bribery and awaits sentencing in Washington
federal court. His amount of the bribes -- including a price that was
$700,000 above market value for the Del Mar Heights house -- was put
at more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Cunningham was elected in 1990 on the strength of his status as a
war hero and the ethical problems of the Democratic incumbent, who had
been scolded by colleagues for sexually harassing staff members.
</P>
<P>
He took office just as the United States launched the Persian Gulf
War to push Saddam Hussein's army out of Kuwait. As a decorated
fighter pilot from the Vietnam War, Cunningham was sought after by the
media, giving him a celebrity that few freshmen congressmen enjoy.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's wife, a school administrator, stood beside him in the
summer when he denied the allegations. The couple are now estranged.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors decline to say whether she may face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Santa Fe home has been sold for $2.6 million and
Cunningham's share of the profits seized by the government. An auction
is set for March 23 for the antiques, rugs and other items, with the
money to be confiscated by the Internal Revenue Service.

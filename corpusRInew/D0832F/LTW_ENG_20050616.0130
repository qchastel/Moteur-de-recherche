Lawmaker to Offer Records to Rebut Conflict Questions

<P>
Rep. Randall ``Duke'' Cunningham, R-Calif., promised
Thursday to produce financial records to prove that he has done
nothing inappropriate by living aboard a yacht owned by the executive
of a defense company that he has supported in its bid to win
government contracts.
</P>
<P>
While declining to be interviewed, Cunningham issued a statement
from his Washington office: ``I am putting information and records
together so that you will know how much I pay to stay there and you
will see that everything we've done is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued in response to a story in The North County
Times, a newspaper in Cunningham's district, reporting that Cunningham
lives aboard a yacht owned by Mitchell J. Wade, president and chief
executive of MZM Inc., while in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The 42-foot yacht is docked at a yacht club on the Potomac River at
a boat slip rented by Cunningham. Cunningham's own boat is being
repaired.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's real estate dealings with Wade have become a matter of
partisan bickering. Wade bought Cunningham's home in the upscale Del
Mar Heights section of San Diego in November 2003 for $1,675,000.
</P>
<P>
Wade put the home on the market a month later and in July 2004 sold
it for $975,000, a $700,000 loss. Democrats have suggested that Wade
may have paid an inflated price to reward a congressman who has
supported his company's bid to get involved in the lucrative and
highly-competitive world of defense contracting.
</P>
<P>
Wade's company, which does classified intelligence work, received
$40 million in contracts in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, 63, an eight-term member of Congress, sits on the
Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Free,
unreported rent would be a violation of ethics laws for members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The district, centered in the coastal communities of northern San
Diego County, is considered ``safe'' for Republicans, with the GOP
enjoying a 44.52 percent to 29.75 percent registration edge over
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Cunningham defeated Democratic candidate Francine P.
Busby 58.5 percent to 36.5 percent, with the rest of votes split
between American Independent, Green, and Libertarian candidates.
</P>
<P>
Busby has announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination
for next year's election. On Thursday, the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee announced it plans to ``target'' the district, a
move that usually means enhanced funding and campaign assistance for
the party candidate.

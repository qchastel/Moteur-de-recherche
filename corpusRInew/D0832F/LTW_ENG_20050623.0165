Lawmaker Cites 'Poor Judgment' in Selling House to Contractor

<P>
Rep. Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, R-Calif., who is under
federal investigation for his financial dealings with a defense
contractor, ended a weeklong silence with a statement Thursday that
asserted his innocence while acknowledging that he exercised ``poor
judgment'' in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
The statement presented the congressman's predicament as a problem
of public perception, and emphatically denied any suggestion that he
had funneled taxpayer-paid benefits to the contractor in exchange for
personal favors.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham was responding to newspaper accounts in his district
over the past two weeks about his friendship with Mitchell Wade,
president of MZM Inc., a Washington-based defense contractor.
Cunningham serves on the powerful House Appropriations subcommittee
that hands out funds for the military.
</P>
<P>
One report detailed the sale of Cunningham's house in Del Mar,
Calif., to Wade two years ago. Wade paid Cunningham $1.675 million and
took a $700,000 loss when he resold it months later. Another report
said Cunningham, while in Washington, has been living on a 42-foot
yacht owned by Wade. The boat, which Wade named the Duke Stir,
apparently after the congressman, is docked on the Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Cunningham said it was not appropriate to answer
specific questions because ``there is now a legal inquiry underway''
and that he had hired an attorney. Cunningham had not previously
commented on reports that the FBI is investigating his activities with
Wade.
</P>
<P>
``I want my constituents to know that I have acted honorably and
honestly,'' he wrote. ``I recognize, however, that I showed poor
judgment in selling my home in Del Mar to a friend who does business
with the government.''
</P>
<P>
``I failed to adequately consider how this transaction might be
perceived by others. ...'' he added.
</P>
<P>
The congressman characterized the house sale as a transaction of
convenience for both men. Cunningham's statement said Wade expressed
interest in buying the house for his company after Cunningham told
Wade that he and his wife were thinking about selling it.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said he did not put the house on a public multi-listing
or hire a real estate agent, in order to save money ``like most people
selling their own home.'' He said he and Wade consulted comparable
home-sale data before agreeing on a purchase price.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham asserted that Wade wanted a house and office space close
to MZM's operations near Miramar Marine Corps Air Station. It could
not be determined what business MZM had then in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker also defended his boat arrangement as proper. He
disclosed that in lieu of rent, he has paid ``dock fees'' and
``service and maintenance'' charges for the boat that have totaled
``well over'' $13,000 since April 2004. Previously, he had been living
on his own, larger boat at the Capital Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
The congressman told the San Diego Union-Tribune that he had
supported the efforts of Wade's firm to get federal contracts. In his
statement Thursday, Cunningham said: ``I want my constituents to know
that, despite my personal friendship with Mr. Wade, I gave his
company, MZM, no preferential treatment.''
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said he ``advocated funding'' for a human intelligence
program, which he did not name, that was supported by other lawmakers
and the Bush administration. MZM has done extensive work for an Army
intelligence center in Charlottesville, Va., among other agencies,
under a contract that has paid it more than $163 million since late
2002, according to Defense Department officials.

Congressman Is Under Fire for Questionable House Sale

On display at the Aerospace Museum in Balboa Park is
one of the F-4 Phantoms that made Randall ``Duke'' Cunningham famous
and propelled him into national politics.
</P>
<P>
Twenty miles up Interstate 5 is the house in upscale Del Mar
Heights that threatens to scuttle his political career and result in
criminal charges after eight terms as a Republican member of the House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, 63, a former Navy fighter pilot who shot down five MiGs
during the Vietnam War and was a role model for Tom Cruise in the
movie ``Top Gun,'' is being investigated by the FBI and other federal
agencies for selling his house in November 2003 to a military
contractor for what may have been an inflated price.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Wade, 42, president and chief executive of
Washington-based MZM Inc., bought the house for $1,675,000, then sold
it seven months later for $975,000, a $700,000 loss. The house deal
was first disclosed earlier this month by The San Diego
Union-Tribune.Critics suggest that Wade paid Cunningham for the house
as a way to illegally funnel money to a congressman who has supported
his company.
</P>
<P>
The fact that for months Cunningham has lived on Wade's yacht,
named the Duke Stir, berthed in the Potomac River, has raised further
questions about improper financial links.
</P>
<P>
Numerous questions remain about the relationship between Wade and
Cunningham, among them, how the sale price for the house was decided
upon, how Wade lost $700,000 on the resale amid one of the hottest
real-estate markets in the state and whether Cunningham is paying an
appropriate rent for the use of Wade's boat.
</P>
<P>
After San Diego's North County Times revealed the yacht deal last
week, Cunningham's office issued a statement offering to prove that he
pays rent, but no records have been produced.
</P>
<P>
Congressional committees rarely vote on individual government
contracts, but members of key panels can influence who gets the
awards. The Defense Appropriations Subcommittee on which Cunningham
sits is one of the most influential.
</P>
<P>
Wade, a reserve officer in the Navy, was a program manager for
communications and intelligence for the Navy and the Department of
Defense for eight years before founding MZM in 1993. The firm
specializes in sophisticated intelligence gathering and analysis.
</P>
<P>
Records show that MZM has more than $66 million in at least 93
government contracts, enough to make the company No. 100 on Washington
Technology magazine's list of the top federal contractors.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham has said that MZM is among those defense contractors he
has favored. A watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics
in Washington, has filed a Freedom of Information Act request for
information about contacts made by Cunningham in favor of MZM with
officials at the Pentagon or the Department of Homeland Security.
</P>
<P>
One of the few unclassified contracts between MZM and the federal
government is a $1.2 million program to provide linguists and
interpreters for Iraq and elsewhere. In another contract, MZM has
joined General Dynamics and other firms to upgrade ``warfare
services'' for the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Like most defense contractors, MZM has a political action committee
that contributes to the campaigns of politicians who influence the
awarding of contracts and shape public policy. The MZM PAC has
contributed to several politicians, including giving $7,000 to
Cunningham's 2004 campaign.
</P>
<P>
Wade has also contributed to Cunningham's own political action
committee, the American Prosperity Political Action Committee, which
doles out money to candidates and causes of his choosing.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cunningham's wife, a chief of staff for an Education
Department official, and one of his daughters are on the advisory
council to the Sure Foundation, a nonprofit group created by Wade and
his wife to raise funds for projects to aid refugee children. Last
year a congressional subcommittee on District of Columbia operations,
with Cunningham as a member, allocated $100,000 to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
A month after selling their Del Mar Heights home, Cunningham and
his wife, Nancy, paid $2.5 million for an 8,000-square-foot home in
exclusive Rancho Santa Fe owned by Douglas and Karen Powanda.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Powanda is a former executive vice president at Peregrine
Systems, a San Diego-based business-software company.
</P>
<P>
Peregrine was Cunningham's third-largest corporate contributor in
2004, giving $14,000 in individual and corporate donations. In late
2004, Powanda was among eight former Peregrine executives indicted by
a federal grand jury in an alleged multibillion-dollar securities
fraud; he awaits trial.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, known as accessible and cordial even to reporters who
have written critically of him, has hunkered down in the wake of the
disclosures about the Del Mar Heights house sale.
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Bill Horn pleaded for the public to reserve
judgment. ``I know everybody's pounced on him, but I think he's due
his day in the public square, to explain himself,'' said Horn.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham serves on the Select Committee on Intelligence, and as
chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Intelligence Analysis and
Counterintelligence in addition to his appropriations post.
</P>
<P>
He has become a favorite for defense contractors and their
lobbyists. For his 2004 campaign, he raised $832,173: of that, $74,550
came from the defense electronics industry, $42,500 from the defense
aerospace industry, $33,550 from miscellaneous defense firms, and
$45,250 from lobbyists with varied clients.

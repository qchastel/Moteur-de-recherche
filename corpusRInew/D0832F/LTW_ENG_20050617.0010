The Duke Stir and the Contractor

If any more proof were needed that it's imperative to resolve the
standoff preventing the House ethics committee from functioning, it
arrived this week in the form of news stories about Rep. Randy
``Duke'' Cunningham, a San Diego Republican.
</P>

When Cunningham wanted to sell his house in 2003, he didn't bother
to put it on the market. Instead, according to reporting by Marcus
Stern of Copley News Service, Cunningham -- who sits on the defense
appropriations subcommittee -- turned to a defense contractor. The
contractor, Mitchell Wade of MZM Inc., bought the house for
$1,675,000. He then put the house back on the market, where it
languished for 261 days before selling for $700,000 less than the
original purchase price.

Cunningham, meanwhile, upgraded to a $2.55 million house, with 7
1/2 baths and a five-car garage. MZM, one of Cunningham's top campaign
donors, obtained millions in government contracts; the congressman,
who also sits on the House intelligence committee, acknowledged to
Stern that he had helped MZM win contracts, as he said he has helped
other firms. Government contracts for the company, whose Web site
describes it as helping solve ``enigmatic problems ... in the areas of
intelligence collection and analysis,'' grew from $41 million in 2003
to $66 million in 2004, according to Washington Technology magazine.

Cunningham said in a statement that he didn't do anything wrong. He
said the sale price was based on ``comparables from an independent
source'' -- but it turns out that source was a real estate agent whose
family also has contributed heavily to Cunningham; Wade simply paid
the asking price. ``I have no reason to believe the value of the house
was inflated then, and I have no reason to think so today,''
Cunningham said. So why did Wade take such a loss, when the San Diego
housing market was booming? And why does Cunningham, when in
Washington, live on a yacht, the Duke Stir, owned by Wade?
</P>

These questions cry out for an ethics investigation. Unfortunately,
the committee is sidelined by a dispute between its chairman and
ranking Democrat. The chairman, Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., wants his
longtime chief of staff to serve as staff director; the ranking
Democrat, Rep. Alan Mollohan (W.Va.), says that contravenes committee
rules that require bipartisan agreement on committee hiring. As we've
said before, on this one, Mollohan has the stronger argument; the last
thing the committee needs is another whiff of politicization.

<P>
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., this week called the gridlock
``unconscionable'' but said he won't get involved in trying to end it.
``Two adult chairmen ought to be able to sit down and hire staff and
go to work without somebody meddling in how they operate,'' Hastert
said. Maybe so, but since they can't, and since the House needs a
functioning ethics committee, it's time for the speaker to lead.

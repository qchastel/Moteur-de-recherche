Contractor Plans Guilty Plea for Bribe-Case Role

<P>
Washington defense contractor Mitchell J. Wade is
expected to enter a guilty plea in federal court here Friday morning
for his role in the bribery-related case involving former Rep. Randall
``Duke'' Cunningham, R-Calif., according to sources familiar with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Wade, who founded Washington D.C.-based MZM Inc., started
cooperating months ago in the inquiry of Cunningham's alleged trading
of ``earmarks'' in congressional appropriations for $2.4 million in
cash, furniture, boats and house payments, sources said. The probe
began last June after the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Wade
bought Cunningham's San Diego home and then resold it months later for
a $700,000 loss. A short time later another newspaper reported that
the congressman also was living rent free on Wade's 42-foot yacht
while in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham first denied the reports, but then pleaded guilty last
November to tax evasion and conspiracy to commit bribery and resigned
from Congress.
</P>
<P>
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the
agreement has not yet been presented in court, said Wade is expected
to admit to his sweetheart purchase of Cunningham's home and to
providing hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gifts to the
congressman. At the time, he was using his position to set money aside
for defense and intelligence programs for contractors, one of which
was identifiable in Cunningham's plea agreement as Wade's MZM.
</P>
<P>
Wade is also expected to acknowledge that he attempted to
improperly influence Defense Department contracting and procurement
officials with inducements and gifts, including offers to hire members
of their families, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The plea agreement will note too how Wade and his employees gave
tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to two other
House members. There is no indication that the House members face any
liability.
</P>
<P>
Wade's attorney, Reginald Brown, had no comment Thursday night.
Wade has been negotiating a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in
the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington for several months, according
to the sources. The deal is expected to be presented to U.S. District
Judge Ricardo Urbina Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Channing Phillips, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office,
declined comment about the case Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MZM grew from a small company in 2002 to one last year that had
more than $50 million in defense contracts and 400 employees, many
with high security clearances. The company was sold last fall to a New
York investment firm and renamed Athena Innovative Solutions Inc.

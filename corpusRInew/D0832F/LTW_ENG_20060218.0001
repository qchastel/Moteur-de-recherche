Prosecutors Want Maximum Sentence for Cunningham

<DATELINE>
SAN DIEGO
</DATELINE>

<P>
Federal prosecutors Friday recommended that former
Rep. Randall ``Duke'' Cunningham serve the maximum 10 years in prison
for what they called ``unparalleled corruption'' and ``naked avarice''
in seeking and taking $2.4 million in bribes.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Carol Lam and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sanjay
Bhandari, Jason Forge and Phillip Halpern also recommended that
Cunningham, who resigned in November after pleading guilty to bribery
and tax evasion, be ordered to pay $1.5 million in taxes and penalties
and forfeit $1.85 million in bribe money and items provided to him by
four alleged co-conspirators.
</P>
<P>
The 29-page document blisters Cunningham for arranging and
overseeing a ``lengthy and widespread bribery'' scheme and even
providing co-conspirators with a ``bribe menu'' detailing how much
money he required to provide a certain dollar amount in federal
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, 63, a Vietnam War hero and conservative Republican who
was in his eighth term when he resigned, is set to be sentenced March
3.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham's attorney, K. Lee Blalack, said that ``for a man of
Duke's age and medical condition, such punishment would likely be a
death sentence.'' Cunningham has undergone surgery for prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
``Duke devoted most of his life to serving this nation honorably in
times of war and peace,'' Blalack said. ``If such a man doesn't
deserve mercy, no one does.''
</P>
<P>
Blalack submitted letters from former Navy pilots, San Diego
religious leaders and Peter Yarrow of folk music group Peter, Paul and
Mary attesting to Cunningham's good character. Yarrow wrote that he
and Cunningham are ``polar opposites politically'' but joined together
in issues involving children's health.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors' document portrays Cunningham as aggressively
demanding bribes from defense contractors and people linked to them in
exchange for using his position on congressional committees to help
them.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors do not detail exactly how much help or what contracts
Cunningham may have steered toward the four co-conspirators. They said
such information cannot be made public because the four are still
being investigated, although they offered to make it available to the
judge under seal.

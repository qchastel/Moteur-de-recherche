Feds Raid GOP Congressman's Home

<P>
Federal agents Friday raided the home of
Rep. Randall ``Duke'' Cunningham, R-San Diego, as part of a grand jury
probe of the congressman's links to a defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
Agents also served search warrants on the Washington offices of MZM
Inc. and the yacht owned by MZM founder Mitchell Wade where Cunningham
has been living for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
K. Lee Blalack, Cunningham's lawyer, called the raid ``an appalling
abuse of government power.'' Cunningham and his wife, Nancy, were not
in when agents arrived at the house in Rancho Santa Fe, an exclusive
community 25 miles north of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
Blalack said that Cunningham had earlier offered to cooperate fully
with FBI authorities probing the sale of his house in Del Mar Heights
to Wade in 2003.
</P>
<P>
``They will apparently not take yes for an answer and have instead
opted to use strong arm tactics that were designed to generate
headlines,'' Blalack said.
</P>
<P>
An attorney from Blalack's law firm arrived at the Rancho Santa Fe
house during the search, which was authorized by a secret affidavit
issued by a federal grand jury in San Diego. FBI officials declined to
say what agents were searching for.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, 63, an eight-term member of Congress, is scheduled to
return to his northern San Diego County district this weekend for July
4th celebrations, his first home visit since controversy began.
</P>
<P>
The federal investigation centers on the sale of Cunningham's house
in November 2003 to Wade for $1,675,000. His critics insist the price
was inflated so that Wade could funnel money to a congressman who has
been helpful in obtaining contracts for MZM.
</P>
<P>
The home was never offered publicly for sale. Cunningham says he
offered to sell the house to Wade after the contractor said he needed
a place near Miramar Marine Corps Air Station where MZM has a project.
Wade sold the home months later for $975,000, a $700,000 loss.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham and his wife bought their 8,000-square-foot home in
Rancho Santa Fe for $2.55 million soon after selling the Del Mar
Heights house to Wade.
</P>
<P>
In a three-page statement issued last week, Cunningham said that he
showed poor judgment in selling home to Wade but said he never gave
preferential treatment to the defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
According to the Defense Information Systems Agency, MZM has
received $163 million in federal contracts, mostly for classified
projects involving the gathering and analysis of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the agency halted the awarding of any new contracts to
MZM as part of a change in federal regulations requiring more
competitive bidding. The change is not related to the investigation
and MZM will be allowed to bid for new projects, said Mike Thiem,
spokesman for the Defense Information Systems Agency.
</P>
<P>
The federal probe into the relationship between Wade and Cunningham
involves the FBI, U.S. attorney's office, Defense Criminal
Investigative Service, and Internal Revenue Service, according to Jan
Caldwell, spokeswoman for the FBI office in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham has lived aboard Wade's 42-foot-yacht, the Duke Stir,
berthed at a Washington-area yacht club on the Potomac River. In his
statement last week, the congressman said he has paid $13,000 in
berthing fees and maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said the price of the Del Mar Heights house was
determined by comparing sales of similar-sized homes in the same
neighborhood. He said the work was done by real estate agent Elizabeth
Todd, a longtime friend and contributor.
</P>
<P>
Todd has also received a subpoena.

Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned in an
attempt to kill him during election campaigning in September, a
British daily reported Wednesday, quoting the doctor who oversaw his
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Viennas Rudolfinerhaus clinic are within days of
identifying the substance that left Yushchenkos face disfigured with
cysts and lesions, Doctor Nikolai Korpan was quoted as telling The
Times in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Specialists in Britain, the United States and France had helped to
establish that it was a biological agent, a chemical agent or, most
likely, a rare poison that struck him down in the run-up to the
presidential election, he said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors needed to examine Yushchenko again at the clinic in Vienna to
confirm their diagnosis but were in no doubt that the substance was
administered deliberately, he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is no longer a question for discussion," Doctor Korpan said.
"We are now sure that we can confirm which substance caused this
illness. He received this substance from other people who had a
specific aim."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the aim had been to kill him, Korpan said: "Yes, of course."
</P>
<P>
Proof that Yushchenko was deliberately poisoned would be a
devastating blow for his rival, the prime minister, Viktor
Yanukovich, as the two candidates prepare for a repeat of a
presidential run-off on December 26, The Times said.
</P>
<P>
It would raise questions about whether the poisoning was ordered by
Yanukovich, his allies, or even the Kremlin, which fears that
Yushchenko will take Ukraine out of its sphere of influence by
joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European
Union, it said.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko had said recently that he would soon reveal proof that his
opponents had tried to assassinate him, but a spokeswoman said he had
no plans to travel to Vienna, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko fell ill on September 6 and was rushed to Rudolfinerhaus
four days later with severe abdominal pain and lesions on his face
and trunk, The Times said.
</P>
<P>
His liver, pancreas and intestines were swollen and his digestive
tract covered in ulcers, but doctors could not explain the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
Against their advice he went back on the campaign trail after a week,
but returned to the clinic two weeks later with back pain.
</P>
<P>
His Austrian doctors had said previously they had no proof of a
criminal poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless his campaign staff have insisted the medical exam
revealed that Yushchenko's illness had been caused "by a viral
infection and chemical substances that are not usually found in food
products."

EGGS, AND CHARGES, FLY IN UKRAINE'S EVER-NASTIER ELECTION

KIEV, Ukraine
</DATELINE>

<P>
One leading candidate has been debilitated by what he said was an
attempt to poison him.
</P>
<P>
A thrown egg did more than smear the coat of another.
</P>
<P>
A mysteriously rescheduled military parade has fueled rumors of plans
for a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Attack ads have explored the depths of what is known here as "black
propaganda."
</P>
<P>
"It's like 'The Matrix,"' said Andrei Gurin, who was not the only
voter here to describe Ukraine's presidential campaign as something
close to cinematic. "Nothing to trust, nothing to believe."
</P>
<P>
President Leonid D. Kuchma's decision not to seek a third five-year
term -- after maneuvering to change the constitution to allow it --
has opened a fierce and increasingly nasty presidential campaign. The
leading candidates are offering starkly different visions, especially
in foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
With election day less than a month away, on Oct. 31, polls suggest a
tight race between the most prominent of two dozen candidates: Viktor
A. Yushchenko, a former prime minister and central banker and now the
leader of the anti-Kuchma opposition; and Viktor F. Yanukovich, the
current prime minister, who promises to carry out much of Kuchma's
legacy.
</P>
<P>
Neither front-runner is expected to win an outright majority. A
runoff is scheduled for Nov. 21. The race is one of the most
competitive in a former Soviet state, and its outcome could
significantly alter the course of this country with 47 million people
at an important crossroads of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko, who appears to hold a slight lead in the polls, has long
been pro-Western and encouraging free-market reforms. He has promised
to steer Ukraine toward a more open and democratic society, ending
what he calls the cronyism and corruption of Kuchma's 10 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko has vowed to improve economic and political relations with
the European Union and NATO, while withdrawing Ukraine's 1,600 troops
from Iraq. Like many here, he argues that Kuchma dispatched the force
largely to improve tattered ties with the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovich's economic and social pledges echo his opponent's, but in
his view Ukraine's future depends on closer relations with Russia,
the country's largest trading partner. He remains more reserved about
Europe and the United States, but has said he would not withdraw
Ukrainian troops from Iraq until democratic elections are held there.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever is the victor, the direction will be clear," said Yuliya V.
Tymoshenko, a supporter of Yushchenko's who has criticized Kuchma's
alternating efforts to improve relations with the West and then with
Russia. "At least a choice will be made. We are tired of the
president and his team pulling the compass of foreign policy
everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Each candidate's campaign has used foreign policy to attack the
other. Posters found in a warehouse and confiscated by Yushchenko's
supporters last week depicted the candidate as a tool of the United
States. One showed President Bush riding Ukraine like a horse under
Yushchenko's campaign logo.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko's supporters in turn deride Yanukovich, accusing him of
seeking to appease Russia. Yanukovich gave his opponents ammunition
with a trip to Moscow that included a meeting on Saturday with
President Vladimir V. Putin, who all but endorsed his candidacy.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Whether the candidates' competing visions decide the vote remains
very much an open question, largely because they have been
overshadowed by the strange twists of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko has spent much of the last month in a hospital in Austria,
after falling ill on Sept. 6 from what he and his supporters called
an attempt to poison him. After returning to Kiev to resume
campaigning on Sept. 18, he accused Kuchma's government of an
assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
"You will not poison us," Yushchenko said to the government at a
large rally of supporters in Kiev that day. "You do not have enough
bullets and trucks to break us."
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 30, however, Yushchenko returned to Austria for treatment of
his ailments, including paralysis in the left side of his face.
</P>
<P>
"The illness is much worse than we thought," said Oleksandr O.
Zinchenko, a member of the national legislature and chairman of
Yushchenko's campaign, speaking in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko only returned to Ukraine on Sunday night, appearing wan
and visibly weakened, in Lviv, the western city where his support is
deepest, according to televised reports. On Monday, he returned to
the campaign trail in Kiev. "I am alive, I am OK, and I am back,"
Yushchenko told a large crowd of supporters.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
In his absence, surrogates have stumped on Yushchenko's behalf, even
as the legislature, controlled by a coalition opposed to Kuchma,
authorized an investigation into his accusations. The hospital in
Vienna, Rudolfinerhaus, first issued a statement discounting the
possibility of poisoning, only to retract it, saying it was
impossible to rule it out.
</P>
<P>
Then the chairman of the legislature's investigation committee,
Volodimir Sivkovich, stunned Yushchenko's supporters by declaring
before the legislature that there was no evidence to suggest an
assassination attempt, although he did not rule out that Yushchenko
might have been poisoned. He said in an interview that "neither
Yushchenko nor his headquarters had any legal right to say that
someone made an attempt on his life."
</P>
<P>
"In our country there are a lot of lies, more than any other country
in the world," Sivkovich said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Yanukovich's supporters have leveled their own accusations of an
attempted assassination. On Sept. 24, Yanukovich collapsed while
campaigning in Ivano-Frankivsk. His aides said at the time that he
was struck in the head by a blunt object and blamed supporters of
Yushchenko.
</P>
<P>
A video, however, clearly shows that an egg struck him in the chest
as he stepped off his campaign bus. After two or three seconds, he
clutched his chest and collapsed into the arms of his aides, who
whisked him to a hospital, although he appeared to have been unhurt.
</P>
<P>
The attack, like all of Yanukovich's campaign events, received
prominent attention on the country's television networks, all but one
of which is owned or controlled by the government. That has prompted
accusations that the government is using all its resources to favor
Yanukovich.
</P>
<P>
A parade to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Kiev's liberation from
Nazi Germany on Nov. 6, 1944, has been moved forward to Oct. 28,
three days before the election. Opponents see that as an election
ploy or, worse, evidence for a military crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Sergei L. Vasiliyev, chief spokesman for Kuchma's administration,
insisted that the election would be free and fair. "We do not have an
experience with any other kind," he said, referring to the country's
post-Soviet presidential elections. He said Yanukovich's dominance in
news reports reflected his official duties as prime minister.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The egg attack appears to have engendered little sympathy, prompting
ridicule and at least one pointed joke. A grandmother goes to the
market, the joke goes, and when finished with her shopping sees an
official portrait of Yanukovich. "Oy," she says, "I forgot to buy
eggs."
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
Yanukovich's opponents have made accusations of serious violations of
election laws, though, as have Ukrainian and international election
observers. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
reported recently that campaign events have been disrupted, while
students and public employees have been pressured to support
Yanukovich's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Oleksandr O. Moroz, a member of the legislature and the perennial
Socialist Party candidate for president, accused the government of
"seriously preparing for falsifying the results" on Yanukovich's
behalf. He said Kuchma might even cancel the election outright, if
Yanukovich risked losing.
</P>
<P>
Vasiliyev, the presidential spokesman, called that "complete
nonsense."
</P>
<P>
Moroz, who trails distantly in the polls, said the circumstances
surrounding the campaign has obscured the country's serious problems.
They include, he said in an interview in his office, social
inequities, an economy controlled by a handful of tycoons close to
the government, corruption and what he called "state criminality"
under Kuchma. He called the election an important choice for Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"People," he said, "are tired of scandals."

Another Month, Another Presidential Election in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KIEV, Ukraine
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citizens go to the polls here Sunday for a repeat
runoff election in a tumultuous presidential campaign marked by the
poisoning of one candidate, an overturning of November results due to
fraud, and a fierce struggle over whether Ukraine should turn toward
the West or reinvigorate ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The rematch between Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and opposition
leader Viktor Yushchenko was set when the Supreme Court threw out last
month's balloting on the grounds that authorities had systematically
inflated Yanukovych's official total to give him a narrow victory. The
court made its ruling in the midst of what has been dubbed the
``Orange Revolution'' -- 17 days of massive protests by as many as
150,000 Yushchenko supporters decked out in his campaign color.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovych has charged that a victory by Yushchenko, victim of the
alleged assassination attempt, would lead to the country's enslavement
by foreigners. Yanukovych has received strong backing from Moscow,
while the United States and the European Union played key roles in
supporting Yushchenko's demand for a rematch.
</P>
<P>
In a fresh legal development Saturday, the nation's Constitutional
Court ruled that a provision in an anti-fraud electoral law approved
by Parliament earlier this month unfairly restricted citizens' rights
by limiting the use of home voting to the most severely disabled.
</P>
<P>
The court, which determines whether laws are constitutional, called
for steps to allow home voting today by all people unable to reach the
polls due to disabliities or poor health, if they requested it by 8
p.m. Saturday. The decision could not be appealed.
</P>
<P>
The ruling endorsed all other aspects of the anti-fraud law. But by
broadening home voting, it also raised fresh practical and legal
issues, given the logistical difficulties and short time available to
implement it.
</P>
<P>
``The Constitutional Court gave a chance to cast ballots to all
voters who cannot move independently ... and it made it clear that the
elections will be legal,'' the court's head, Mykola Selivon, told
reporters. ``Now, no one will be able to say that the future president
is illegitimate or elected unconstitutionally.''
</P>
<P>
Passions remain high, however, with Yushchenko supporters still
fearful of fraud and Yanukovych's backers convinced that victory was
unfairly taken from him last month.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have warned of a risk of post-election violence in this
country of 48 million located between Russia and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
``I think it will be a colossal mistake on the part of the current
regime if even one drop of blood is shed in the coming days,''
Yushchenko said at a Friday news conference.
</P>
<P>
He called on security forces and police ``to prevent any conflict
or manifestation of any aggression between rallies that Orange
Revolution supporters and Yanukovych supporters will hold.''
</P>
<P>
Top law enforcement officials said they were prepared to do just
that.
</P>
<P>
``State security will do everything to prevent attempts by certain
groups to violate law, order and people's constitutional rights,''
said Ihor Smeshko, head of the Security Service of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Widely viewed as a pro-Western democratic reformer, Yushchenko has
vowed to crack down on corruption, seek closer ties with the United
States and the European Union, and complete this post-Soviet state's
transformation to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovych, whose power base is in largely Russian-speaking eastern
Urkraine, has emphasized economic ties with Russia and a slower pace
of change. Citing strong economic growth and an increase in exports
during his two years as prime minister, Yanukovych has charged that
the European Union and the United States fear competition from Ukraine
and have supported Yushchenko in order to turn the country into a
colony. He has also won support from older voters with a recent sharp
boost in pensionpayments.
</P>
<P>
``We won't allow our elderly to be demeaned,'' Yanukovych declared
at a rally in Kiev on Friday, the last day of campaigning. ``We won't
allow anyone else to build our future for our own children. Together,
we will win.''
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 foreign observers have been dispatched to Ukraine by
various organizations including the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to help ensure an honest election.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's balloting is a repeat of a runoff round held on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
The first round had 24 candidates and was held on Oct. 31. In that
balloting Yushchenko finished a fraction of a percentage point ahead
of Yanukovych after a slow vote count during which critics charged the
Central Election Commission was doing everything possible to find a
way to declare the prime minister the winner.
</P>
<P>
A largely revamped commission is in charge of Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
Foreign observers charged after both earlier rounds that regional
and local administrative and electoral officials loyal to Yanukovych
and to outgoing President Leonid D. Kuchma, as well as the Central
Election Commission, which was packed with their supporters, had
cooperated in systematic voting fraud.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy and several other Western embassies and
foundations have financially supported exit polling in each round to
assist in judging whether the official count is honest.
</P>
<P>
Centrist parliamentary speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn said he believed
Saturday's ruling would ``fully cut off possible lawsuits after the
election.''
</P>
<P>
``Fears that the election can be scuttled today no longer exist,''
Lytvyn said. ``We should know the name of the new president if not on
Monday, then Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
Election authorities and the Yushchenko camp also portrayed the
ruling as allowing for a legitimate election. Still, the decision
failed to eliminate the possibility of legal challenges or street
protests by Yanukovych backers should he lose.
</P>
<P>
The bitterness of the campaign intensified in September when
Yushchenko suddenly became ill and accused authorities of poisoning
him in an assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, his doctors at a private clinic in Vienna,
Austria, said tests confirmed he was the victim of dioxin poisoning,
which has disfigured his face with pockmarks, cysts and darkened
areas. Dioxins are a class of toxic organic compounds usually produced
during waste incineration or in manufacturing processes that use
chlorine.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko reportedly was poisoned with pure TCDD, which was an
element in Agent Orange, a herbicide sprayed by U.S. troops during the
Vietnam War to clear away dense vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko fell sick the day after having late-night food and
drinks with Smeshko, the state security chief, and others. He has
implied that he believes there may be a foreign connection to the
poisoning but has offered few details of what he believes happened. He
has said a full investigation should wait until the election is over.
</P>
<P>
Smeshko himself is widely seen as having reformist sympathies and
would not necessarily be a leading suspect, were it to be determined
that it was indeed an intentional poisoning.
</P>
<P>
``I believe this matter will not be difficult to solve,''
Yushchenko said at his Friday news conference. ``Today there is plenty
of proof about how this poison got into Ukraine and how it got into
the food.''
</P>
<P>
He gave no further explanation.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko and his supporters have made repeated reference during
the campaign to revelations that Yanukovych, as a youth, served prison
time for robbery and assault, and they charge that he is still a front
man for powerful but corrupt business groups.
</P>
<P>
``I have honor,'' Yushchenko said during a televised debate Monday,
in a comment that was ostensibly a rebuttal to charges of foreign
funding of his campaign but was clearly meant to remind voters of
Yanukovych's long-ago run-ins with the law. ``These hands have never
stolen anything, I have never taken anything that wasn't mine. I've
never been imprisoned,'' Yushchenko said. ``I lead an honest life.''
</P>
<P>
A biography distributed on behalf of Yanukovych says that ``having
suffered through a very tragic and tough childhood,'' the prime
minister acknowledges regrettable youthful indiscretions, resulting in
criminal charges that were eventually overturned by a Ukrainian court.
</P>
<P>
Opponents acknowledge that a court expunged his criminal record
decades ago but question the reasons for that action.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, who is stepping down after 10 years in power, charged in a
nationally televised address Friday that both candidates had failed to
place top priority on the nation's interests.
</P>
<P>
``There is no treacherous foe on its threshold who could threaten
the existence of the Ukrainian people, but peace has left our land of
plenty,'' Kuchma declared. ``What has happened to us then? Both sides
have been tempted to claim glory only for themselves and accuse their
political rivals of all sins, both involuntary and fictitious.''
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins, Kuchma said, the two rivals must ``find a force in
themselves to give a hand of cooperation to each other. The Ukrainian
people ... need this civil act.''

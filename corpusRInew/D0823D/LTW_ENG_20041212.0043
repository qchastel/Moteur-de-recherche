Ukraine Reopens Probe of Yushchenko Poisoning

The Ukrainian prosecutor-general's office
announced Sunday it had reopened an investigation into allegations
that presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned, after
doctors in Austria confirmed he had ingested dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Returning to Kiev after checking out of a clinic in Vienna,
Austria, Yushchenko said he was sure that authorities were responsible
for the dioxin poisoning that had disfigured his face and caused other
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
``I am convinced that this is the work of the authorities,
absolutely convinced,'' Yushchenko told reporters at Kiev airport.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Western reformer is engaged in a bitter presidential
contest with Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and has alleged since
suddenly falling ill in September that he was poisoned in an
assassination attempt. Authorities have denied the charge, and some
pro-government politicians have ridiculed it.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko fell sick Sept. 6, a day after having late-night food
and drinks with Ihor Smeshko, the head of the Security Service of
Ukraine, and others.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor-general's office dropped its initial investigation
of the allegation in late October. Serhiy Rudenko, a spokesman, said
then that no poisoning agents had been found in forensic medical tests
and that there was no data to prove deliberate poisoning or the use of
biological weapons against Yushchenko.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Sunday at the private Rudolfinerhaus clinic
in Vienna, where doctors announced Saturday that they had confirmed
dioxin poisoning, Yushchenko said a full-scale investigation should
wait until after Dec. 26, when he faces Yanukovych in a repeat
election.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court set the revote after ruling that the Nov. 21
balloting, narrowly won by Yanukovych according to the official count,
was invalid due to fraud.
</P>
<P>
``I don't want this factor to influence the election in some way --
either as a plus or a minus,'' Yushchenko said. ``This question will
require a great deal of time and serious investigation. Let us do it
after the election. Today is not the moment.''
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko said massive street protests in central Kiev's
Independence Square, which helped prompt parliament to enact electoral
reforms aimed at preventing fraud in the revote, had brought historic
change to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
``I think that the heart of Ukraine moved to Independence Square in
Kiev over the last three weeks, and old people, young people,
everyone, were defending not Yushchenko but they were defending their
choice for the type of Ukraine they want to see in the future,'' he
said, as his U.S.-born wife, Kateryna Chumachenko, translated.
</P>
<P>
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,''
Yuschenko said. ``I think it would be appropriate to compare this to
the fall of the Soviet Union or the fall of the Berlin Wall. ... Over
the last three weeks, you have seen a different country, a different
nation. The regime that was in place for 14 years in Ukraine is now
living its last days.''
</P>
<P>
Michael Zimpfer, the clinic's director, thanked doctors from around
the world who had helped ``to clarify the difficult Yushchenko illness
that has not been observed anywhere else beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
While dioxin poisoning is not medically unknown, it typically
occurs through environmental exposure, when it is inhaled or absorbed
through the skin. Doctors said Saturday that damage to Yushchenko's
digestive system suggested the poison had been ingested.
</P>
<P>
``It would have been easy to put it in a cream soup,'' Zimpfer said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At Kiev airport, Yushchenko said it should not take too long to
reach a conclusion in the attempted murder case. ``A lot of the
circumstances are already known,'' he said. ``I think if the general
prosecutor acts according to Ukraine's laws, both the country and the
world at large will soon know who did this.''

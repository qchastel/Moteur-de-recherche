DONETSK, Ukraine, Oct 30 -  In Donetsk, part of the Russian-speaking
Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, they have no doubt about the
outcome of this Sunday's presidential election: Viktor Yanukovich,
prime minister and the candidate backed by outgoing president Leonid
Kuchma, will be elected in a local landslide.
</P>
<P>
They are fairly confident, too, in Khoruzhivka, a village of 1,500
people in the northeast of the country. Their favourite son, Viktor
Yuschchenko, pro-western candidate of the opposition, will be the
next president of Ukraine's 50 million people, in spite of a
systematic campaign against him.
</P>
<P>
Two Viktors, two candidates, two constituencies. But in Donetsk there
is little evidence that there is any race at all. Supporters of
Yushchenko tried to put up marquees to distribute publcity for their
candidate but the main square is the only place one can be found.
</P>
<P>
"The town hall decided our tents were 'an architectural form' and so
we had to get permission from several municipal services and the
environmental inspectors to put them up," said Maria Olyinik, head of
the Yushchenko team in Donetsk.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the campaign have spent days arguing their case:
meanwhile opposition offices are vandalised and the police refuse to
take action. A critical regional weekly has been closed down and its
staff evicted from their offices.
</P>
<P>
Olyinik admits that Yushchenko will not do very well in this region:
10 percent to 12 percent if the election is fair; zero percent to
five percent if its is rigged, she says.
</P>
<P>
In Khoruzhivka, 300 kilometres (180 miles) to the north,
Yuschchenko's home town, they miss Channel 5, the only opposition
television station, which is no longer broadcast in this part of
Ukraine. Visiting the capital Kiev to demonstrate for Yushchenko had
to be a night time expedition, locals say, because police blocked the
roads during the day.
</P>
<P>
But the village's walls are plastered with pictures of Yushchenko
kissing one of his five children and the village school boasts a
computer suite financed by the local boy made good.
</P>
<P>
Here they have no doubt that a mysterious illness that struck
Yushchenko recently and has left traces on his face was an attempt to
poison him.
</P>
<P>
Although a native of the northeast Yuschcenko draws much of his
support from the more western-orientated Ukrainian-speaking south and
west of the country.
</P>
<P>
"He is an honest man: I always cry when I listen to the lies they
tell about him on the television," said one elderly lady. And there
are fears that the election of Yanukovich. overtly backed by Russian
President Vladmir Putin, could herald a new era of repression.
</P>
<P>
One local man says the village has been told it will be punished if
Yanukovich collects less than 34 percent of the vote locally.
</P>
<P>
In Donetsk they are confident that Yanukovich will win 90 percent
local backing, not least because he has recently doubled pensions.
The only protests have come from four retired people who turned up at
local government offices to call for an honest election and to 
protest against rising prices.

Ukraine's Parliament again set to grapple with electoral reforms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ukraine's fractious Parliament again finds itself debating
legislation intended to ensure a fair presidential vote and trim
presidential powers, which has the potential to shape the nation's
political system for years to come.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for a compromise at Wednesday's session appeared dim as
supporters of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko
pushed strongly for electoral changes to close loopholes for fraud in
the Dec. 26 rerun of the election, but resisted the constitutional
changes which would transfer some presidential powers over to
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of communists, socialists and pro-government factions in
Parliament don't oppose the electoral changes, but will only agree to
pass them along with the constitutional changes.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko has balked at the constitutional reforms, saying allies of
outgoing President Leonid Kuchma want to steal his potential victory
by weakening the presidency.
</P>
<P>
In a development that could have a dramatic effect on the scene, the
Times of London Web site reported Wednesday that doctors who treated
Yushchenko for a mysterious illness during the initial campaign have
determined there "was an attempt on his life" with a biological or
chemical agent or a rare poison.
</P>
<P>
"There is no longer a question for discussion," the newspaper quoted
Dr. Nikolai Korpan, who treated Yushchenko at the Rudolfnerhaus
clinic in Vienna, Austria. "We are now sure that we can confirm which
substance cause this illness. He received this substance from other
people who had a specific aim."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper then said it asked Korpan if the aim had been to kill
Yushchenko, to which the doctor was quoted as responding: "Yes, of
course."
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko fell ill September 6 and was rushed to the Vienna clinic
four days later. Yushchenko has accused the Ukrainian authorities of
poisoning him. His detractors suggested he'd eaten some bad sushi.
Known for his ruggedly handsome, almost movie star looks,
Yushchenko's skin now is severely pockmarked. His face is haggard,
swollen and partially paralyzed. One eye often tears up.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Korpan had said the cause of Yushchenko's illness
remained "totally open." He told the Times that the substance that
was administered to Yushchenko would be identified in a matter of
days, but physicians needed him to return to Vienna for an
examination.
</P>
<P>
"We need to check him again here in Vienna. If we received him today,
we could finish the whole investigation in two or three days," Korpan
was quoted.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand orange-clad Yushchenko supporters, growing impatient
over the lack of progress in passing the legislation, besieged
Parliament Tuesday, chanting "Parasites! Parasites!" as attempts to
forge a compromise failed, with each side accusing the other of
acting in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
The impasse in Parliament comes as Kuchma and his allies seek to slow
Yushchenko's growing momentum following last Friday's Supreme Court
ruling that canceled the Nov. 21 runoff victory by the Kremlin-backed
Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych.
</P>
<P>
A breakthrough seemed near Monday, when parliamentary factions agreed
to pass the changes all at once on condition that constitutional
reform would be implemented after new parliamentary elections in
2006. Yushchenko's allies hope to win a majority in Parliament that
would make the amendments harmless for Yushchenko.
</P>
<P>
But the deal collapsed Tuesday when Yushchenko's supporters said that
they would only consider constitutional changes after the Parliament
approves electoral amendments and Kuchma signs them into law. They
also demanded that the president reshuffle the Central Election
Commission, which was accused of covering up fraud.
</P>
<P>
Communist party chief Petro Symonenko and others accused Yushchenko
of reneging on a pledge made during European Union-brokered talks
last week to vote for electoral and constitutional changes together.
</P>
<P>
"He has broken an international agreement, so how we can trust his
faction in Parliament?" Symonenko said during the parliamentary
debate.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko's allies say Kuchma and his clan are trying to thwart
electoral changes.
</P>
<P>
"We don't trust this government which is trying to rape the nation,
depriving it of the right to elect the president," opposition
lawmaker Oleksandr Turchinov said.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko supporters also have pushed for Yanukovych's resignation,
but Kuchma has refused to fire him and instead, on Tuesday, approved
his leave of absence for the campaign period, naming a deputy premier
as caretaker.
</P>
<P>
Throngs of opposition demonstrators, many of them haggard after
two-week street vigils in freezing temperatures, pledged that they
would maintain their raucous, often noisy vigil until the legislation
passed.
</P>
<P>
"We have grown tired physically, but spiritually we are longing for a
victory," said Olha Pokalchuk, 44.
</P>
<P>
"Our blockade will force these parasites to back down," echoed
67-year old Kiev resident Adam Litkovets.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovych's supporters, who briefly visited the capital early in the
two-week crisis, have retreated to their home regions in the east,
along the border with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The exodus of Yanukovych's top allies continued, following the
resignation of his campaign chief last week, with senior lawmaker
Stepan Havrysh saying he wouldn't take part in Yanukovych's campaign.
</P>
<P>
In an effort apparently to expand his support base, Yanukovych has
also sought to disassociate himself from the unpopular Kuchma and
shed the image of being the president's puppet.
</P>
<P>
His new campaign chief, Taras Chornovil, accused Kuchma Tuesday of
trying to discredit Yanukovych and said the president's billionaire
son-in-law was financing Yushchenko's campaign.

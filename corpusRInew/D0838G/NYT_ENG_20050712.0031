HANG UP AND DRIVE: STUDY SAYS CELL PHONES INCREASE CRASH CHANCES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drivers using cell phones -- even hands-free models -- are four
times more likely to get into a serious injury crash,
according to a study being released today.
</P>
<P>
The findings suggest that laws banning handheld cell phones give drivers
a false sense of security and that perhaps it's time
to consider an all-out prohibition on talking behind the wheel,
according to the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which
released the report and noted that it is the first
to quantify the injury risk of cell phones and driving.
</P>
<P>
"What this research will do is add to the body of
evidence that both hands-free and handheld phones pose a risk
while driving," said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the institute,
which is funded by auto insurers.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that people should not be talking on
cell phones while they're driving. They should not be talking
on cell phones of any kind while they're driving."
</P>
<P>
The rapid proliferation of cell phones -- last week it was
reported that cell phones have overtaken land lines in the
United States and that nearly half of all drivers use
them behind the wheel -- has increasingly been a source
of tension on the road.
</P>
<P>
One in three drivers said their greatest aggravation on the road
is cell-phone use by other drivers, according to one of
the recent studies.
</P>
<P>
Every state has at some point considered legislation on cell phones
behind the wheel, while a few states have banned phones
unless they're hands-free devices, according to the National Conference of
State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
California still has no such laws banning cell phones for drivers
-- although one law prohibits bus drivers from talking while
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
A pilot study in 2001 found that cell-phone use in California
was the No. 1 culprit in crashes in which driver
distraction was cited as the cause.
</P>
<P>
"We have often made the argument that it's the conversation, and
perhaps dialing the phone, that are the distractions," said Tom
Marshall, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
Marshall said the department is still weighing whether prohibitions would help.
</P>
<P>
"In our mind, it's still a tossup whether hands-free or handheld
(prohibitions would help)."
</P>
<P>
But the national wireless association says cell phones shouldn't be singled
out without considering all the distractions drivers experience while in
their vehicles -- the burgers, the coffee, the kids who
need attention.
</P>
<P>
"We've always said it can be a potential distraction," said John
Walls, a spokesman for CTIA The Wireless Association, the trade
association representing such wireless carriers as Cingular and Verizon as
well as phone makers and other industry-related companies.
</P>
<P>
"To address the issue of distracted driving, you really should look
at the totality of the issue and not just look
at one behavior because a lot of people do it.
</P>
<P>
"If someone wants to go to that degree, at the same
time, we'd have to look at banning all those distractive
behaviors, to be fair. Let's look at banning drive-through restaurants.
Let's look at banning radios."
</P>
<P>
The study examined the cell-phone records of crash victims interviewed in
emergency rooms between April 2002 and July 2004.
</P>
<P>
It found a consistent fourfold increased risk of injury among drivers
on cell phones -- be they men or women, older
or younger drivers.
</P>
<P>
The institute conducted the study in Western Australia because it said
U.S. phone companies would not allow its researchers access to
personal phone records. CTIA could not comment on that claim.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also wanted to test the risks in that area of
Australia where there has been a ban on using handheld
devices. One-third of the drivers said their calls had been
made on handheld phones, the study said.
</P>
<P>
"The problem with the laws that are being passed is they
are leaving people with the impression that hands-free phones are
safer and they're clearly not," Rader said.
</P>
<P>
"We think that laws banning both types of cell-phone use while
driving are probably a good idea, but the big problem
with that is how do you enforce it? It's difficult
to identify a driver using a hands-free phone."
</P>
<P>
Rader disputed the industry's assertion that cell phones shouldn't be singled
out as a problem.
</P>
<P>
"This is a distraction that tends to last over a period
of time," Rader said. "It's not a moment, a distraction
of changing the radio station or talking to your child
in the back seat. It's a distraction that lasts a
period of minutes.
</P>
<P>
"The body of evidence is pointing toward the conversation as being
a major distraction when driving and talking on the cell
phone."

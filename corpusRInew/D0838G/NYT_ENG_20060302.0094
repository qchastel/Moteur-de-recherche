<P>
A proposal in Olympia to ban driving while
talking on hand-held cell phones crashed in the state House.
</P>
<P>
"They completely gutted it," Federal Way Democratic Sen. Tracey Eide said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eide's bill would have outlawed talking on a cell phone while
driving unless drivers were using headsets or other hands-free devices.
It passed the state Senate but ran into fierce opposition
in the House.
</P>
<P>
The House wrote a neutered version that prohibits driving and talking
on a cell phone for only people who have an
instruction permit or an intermediate driver's license given to someone
under age 18.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ed Murray, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said gutting
it was the only way to get the bill through
his committee.
</P>
<P>
"I was one of the only votes" for Eide's original bill,
said Murray, a Democrat from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Opponents had a wide range of arguments. Some said it was
another case of big government. Others said using a hands-free
device wouldn't be less distracting than just gabbing on the
cell phone.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jeff Morris, an Anacortes Democrat on the transportation committee, said
inattentive driving is already an infraction.
</P>
<P>
"The problem with her bill is that it picks out one
piece of technology," Morris said.
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't want to target just cell phones since
global positioning devices and other electronics are just as distracting.
</P>
<P>
Eide was upset. She's been pushing the bill in Olympia for
the past seven years. She said constituents are tired of
seeing people chatting on their cell phones when they should
have both hands on the wheel.
</P>
<P>
Eide thought this would be the year because most of the
telecom companies dropped their opposition to the bill.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to come back with it next year," she said.

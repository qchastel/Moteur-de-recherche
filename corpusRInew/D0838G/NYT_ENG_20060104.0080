SAFER ROADS, LOWER RATES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone complains about Massachusetts' high automobile insurance rates. But what are
you willing to give up to do something about it?
</P>
<P>
It is no secret why we have some of the highest
rates in the country: Massachusetts leads the nation in accidents
- 40 percent higher than the state with the second-highest
rate, Rhode Island. Since the day that maniac Paul Revere
roared through the city's narrow streets at midnight, we Bostonians
have considered bad driving a birthright. And every year we
get to pay for it come premium time.
</P>
<P>
There is plenty we could do that would make driving safer
and lower rates - though it sometimes involves surrendering a
piece of our cherished "personal freedoms." Here are three ideas
we should consider:
</P>
<P>
Buckle up or pay up. The new push in the Legislature
to require drivers to wear seat belts is a good
place to start.
</P>
<P>
That Massachusetts drivers rank ahead of only those in Mississippi in
wearing seat belts is an embarrassment, but says much about
our attitudes about driving. According to the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, seat belt usage in Massachusetts stands at 64.8
percent, compared to 82 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia allow the police to
stop drivers solely for not wearing a seat belt. In
Massachusetts, drivers can be ticketed only if they have been
stopped for another offense. Everyone knows wearing a seat belt
is the right thing to do. (Correction: New Hampshire, of
course, has no adult seat belt law at all.) The
Legislature has twice come within a vote of doing the
right thing. To do the wrong thing three times in
a row is just plain stupid.
</P>
<P>
Put down the cellphone. Talking on your cellphone while driving is
a bad idea. It is obvious whether you have been
nearly rear-ended by the fool gabbing on his cellphone in
the next car or done it yourself. Many of us
have.
</P>
<P>
Plenty of studies have confirmed the obvious. Drivers using cellphones are
four times as likely to get into crashes serious enough
to send them to the hospital, according to the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety. Harvard University's Center for Risk Analysis
estimated 2,600 people are killed and 330,000 injured a year
because of drivers talking on their cellphones - and that
was three years ago. And evidence is mounting that using
a hands-free device instead of a hand-held phone while behind
the wheel does little to improve safety, and may even
give drivers a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
New York, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C., among others, have banned
the use of hand-held sets while driving. The powerful cellphone
industry, with much to lose, is the biggest obstacle to
regulation. And our own compulsive behavior.
</P>
<P>
Use the technology. Running red lights is the leading cause of
urban accidents, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures,
causing more than 200,000 crashes and 900 deaths every year.
</P>
<P>
In response, 15 states and the District of Columbia have passed
legislation allowing cities and towns to use video cameras to
ticket violators. This is hardly radical stuff: In 1910, Massachusetts
once used a device known as a photo speed recorder,
and its use was upheld by the Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
The so-called automatic enforcement technology photographs the license plates of cars
as they are going through red lights, and civil citations
are mailed to violators. Used at problem intersections, cameras are
a powerful and cost-effective deterrent to impatient drivers.
</P>
<P>
The technology is not popular with the live-free-or-die crowd, but civil
citations have been widely upheld by the courts. The privacy
issue is a red herring; people simply don't like tickets.
</P>
<P>
What are you willing to give up to make the highways
safer? If the answer is none of the above, then
stop complaining and send in your insurance premium.

HANDS-FREE CELLPHONE DEVICES NO SAFER FOR MOTORISTS, STUDY CONCLUDES

A study of Australian drivers found that those using
cell phones were four times as likely to be involved
in a serious crash regardless of whether they used hands-free
devices like earpieces or speaker phones that have been perceived
as making talking while driving safer.
</P>
<P>
The study, which is to appear in The British Medical Journal
on Tuesday, is the first of its kind to use
actual crash data and cell phone records to show a
link between talking on the phone and being seriously injured
in an accident.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first to definitively conclude outside of a
laboratory setting that holding a phone to your ear and
talking through a hands-free device poses the same risks.
</P>
<P>
Because cell phone records are not considered public information, a similar
study has not been conducted in the United States. The
most up-to-date research by the federal government has relied either
on volunteers who were videotaped during a crash or on
experiments in which a driver was monitored by researchers in
a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The new study examined the cell phone records of 744 drivers
who had accidents in Perth, Australia, where drivers are required
to use hands-free devices. Researchers estimated the time of the
crash and looked at whether the driver used a cell
phone in the minutes leading up to the accident. They
then examined similar time intervals in the days before the
crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone.
</P>
<P>
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a nonprofit research group in
Virginia, sent researchers to three hospitals in Perth during a
two-year period from 2002 to 2004 to interview crash victims.
The researchers asked several questions, including whether the driver had
a hands-free device in the car and how often the
device was used. To avoid having drivers incriminate themselves, the
researchers did not ask if a hands-free apparatus was in
use at the time of the crash. Rather, they asked
drivers how often they used such a device and factored
that into determining the devices' effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
"There is no safety advantage associated with switching to the types
of hands-free devices that are commonly in use," the study
concludes.
</P>
<P>
With several states restricting the use of cell phones in cars,
the findings raise questions about how useful those laws are.
Currently, New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia
require drivers to use a hands-free device. Beginning Oct. 1,
Connecticut will also make holding a phone and driving illegal.
But as the Australian research and other recent studies show,
it is the act of talking, not holding a phone,
that is the most distracting.
</P>
<P>
"There just doesn't seem to be any safety benefit by restricting
drivers to hands-free phones," Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said. "It's the cognitive overload
that sometimes occurs when you're engaging in a conversation that
is the source of the distraction more so than the
manipulation of the device."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the New York's Department of Motor Vehicles said
the department was conducting a study of the way cell
phone use affects driving and would report the findings to
the Legislature before the end of the year. That report
could include recommendations for additional restrictions on using cell phones
while driving, the spokesman, Christine Burling, said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian study notes not only that cell phone laws are
hard to enforce but that more restrictive measures there appear
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
"While a possible solution in the future is to change mobile
phones so they cannot be used when vehicles are in
motion," the Australian study said, "the likelihood the industry would
embrace such a change seems remote."
</P>
<P>
Paul A. Green, a scientist at the University of Michigan Transportation
Research Institute, said studies like this could serve as a
wake-up call to lawmakers. "They're most convinced by the tombstone
count," he said. "And I think this does a lot,
especially when it comes to policy."

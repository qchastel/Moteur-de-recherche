TEXAS CELL PHONE BAN TARGETS FIRST-TIME TEEN DRIVERS; LEGISLATION MEANT TO ADDRESS SAFETY RISK IS TOO MURKY, SOME SAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
AUSTIN, Texas

<P>
In driving school, they teach everything from how
to parallel park to how to change lanes. What they
don't explain is how to drive and talk on a
cell phone at the same time.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Texas lawmakers decided they are ready to step in.
The House tentatively passed a measure that prohibits a minor
from using a wireless communications device, including cell phones and
pagers, for six months after getting a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jose Menendez, D-San Antonio, attached the measure to a Senate
bill that deals with commercial driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
"I am hoping to get the next generation of drivers used
to not using cell phones," Menendez said. "I think we
can make all streets in Texas safer."
</P>
<P>
The amendment was adopted without much debate and without recording the
vote, but members tried to reconsider their decision after realizing
what the measure entailed. That motion, however, failed 61-77.
</P>
<P>
Menendez initially wanted a broader ban but had no success in
getting it heard. The amendment adopted, though, also prohibits a
person younger than 17 from using a wireless communications device
while driving a motorcycle or moped during the first six
months.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Joe Nixon, R-Houston, said although it may be a good
idea, the language in the amendment is too vague. He
said it isn't clear whether law enforcement officers would be
able to stop anyone who they think is younger than
18 and might have a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
"Do you have to turn off the car and get out
of the car to talk on the phone?" Nixon asked.
</P>
<P>
Nixon said adopting this clause would also add a new category
of probable cause and give officials another reason to stop
suspects. Once the police stop someone, they can search the
entire vehicle, he said.
</P>
<P>
The measure that was adopted Wednesday also prohibits a new driver
from wearing a headset and talking on the phone. Nixon
said that may cause problems.
</P>
<P>
"What if someone is following you and you want to call
the police?" he said. "The police can help you, but
then they would have to give you a ticket for
calling them."
</P>
<P>
The bill now goes back to the Senate, where lawmakers can
either accept the Menendez amendment or ask to go to
a conference committee.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jon Lindsay, R-Houston, the bill's author, said although he wouldn't
be in favor of a broader ban, he welcomes the
amendment that was added.
</P>
<P>
"Young drivers need to learn how to drive first," Lindsay said.
"I have enough experience with young drivers to know they
should not have their attention diverted to other things."
</P>
<P>
Several other lawmakers this session filed bills relating to the regulation
of cell phones while driving, but none got anywhere. The
bills included prohibiting the use of phones while driving through
a school zone and outlawing everything but the use of
headsets.
</P>
<P>
Menendez said he hopes the legislation adopted Wednesday will lead driving
schools to teach about the dangers of talking and operating
a vehicle at the same time.

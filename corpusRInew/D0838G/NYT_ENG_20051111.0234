New drivers are dialing for danger
</P>

The sky was clear. The pavement was dry. Traffic was routine
for a weekday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
As the 17-year-old driver exited U.S. 69 in Overland Park, he
rolled his pickup as he tried to grab a ringing
cell phone from the passenger-side floorboard, police said. He was
not badly hurt.
</P>
<P>
"There was no reason for him to go off (the ramp)
other than he just took it too fast, and that
was because he was distracted by the cell phone," said
Eric Houston, the Overland Park police officer who investigated the
crash last summer.
</P>
<P>
Cell phones and teens are becoming an increasingly dangerous combination on
the highway, traffic-safety advocates say. Teens already account for a
disproportionate share of traffic fatalities, and wireless phones exacerbate the
problem, they say.
</P>
<P>
Eleven states and the District of Columbia have put limits on
teens using cell phones while they drive. At least 11
other states have considered such laws, including Michigan, which is
poised to ban cell-phone use by drivers younger than 18.
There are no such limits in Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
Now the National Transportation Safety Board is urging other states to
pass similar laws for teens learning to drive. "We know
that when you're learning a skill, you should not be
distracted while you are doing it," said Mark Rosenker, acting
chairman of the safety board. "Anything that takes away from
the total focus of learning how to drive is a
distraction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some teens recognize the risk, but others discount the danger that
cell phones might pose. They also do not understand why
young people should be singled out when wireless phones are
as much of a distraction to adults.
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think it distracts me," T.C. Alex, a 15-year-old
from Olathe, said. "I pay extra attention when I'm talking
on the phone. I'm looking out my mirror and that
kind of thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was among a group of teens enrolled in a driver's
education class at Olathe South School who recently shared their
views about driving and talking on cell phones.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Callie Wheeler said she sometimes answered the phone while she
was driving but talked only briefly. She said she understood
the gravity of driving.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into a wreck," she said. "I
get distracted enough by the radio."
</P>
<P>
She said she thought it made sense to restrict phones for
inexperienced drivers. But lawmakers who lead transportation committees in Missouri
and Kansas said they did not think cell-phone restrictions for
teens would advance in their states. They said their legislatures
appeared to be in no mood to place new curbs
on personal freedoms.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board comes at a
time when people of all ages are using cell phones
more frequently while on the road.
</P>
<P>
A federal study found that last year 8 percent of all
U.S. motorists, or about 1.2 million drivers, used cell phones
while operating their vehicles at any given time.
</P>
<P>
The study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that
the percentage of drivers between the ages of 16 and
24 who talked on handheld cell phones increased from 3
percent in 2002 to 8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, cell phones increasingly contribute to crashes in
Kansas and Missouri among drivers younger than 21. In that
age group, cell-phone-related crashes rose 12 percent last year in
Missouri and 38 percent in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest concern for young drivers is their lack of experience,"
said Lt. John Eickhorn of the Kansas Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
"When you add something to the mix on top of their
inexperience, it only equates to more crashes with injuries and
fatalities."
</P>
<P>
Last year Kansas recorded 260 crashes in which a cell phone
was a contributing factor. About a third involved a dr
iver who was younger than 21.
</P>
<P>
In Missouri, about 31 percent of the 1,246 cell-phone related crashes
in 2004 involved a driver younger than 21. Authorities said
they doubted that statistics fully measured the problem, because most
drivers did not readily admit they were talking on a
cell phone before a crash.
</P>
<P>
But police reports are laced with examples of how teens wreck
when they turn their attentions to cell phones. Consider these:
</P>
<P>
An 18-year-old man struck a car driven by a pregnant woman
as he reached to grab a cell phone from his
back pants pocket. The woman, who was 26 weeks pregnant,
complained of back and neck pain after the September 2004
crash in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
A 15-year-old girl, driving without her permit at 1 a.m., struck
a parked Jeep when she reached to the passenger seat
to answer a phone. No one was hurt in the
July 2004 crash in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
As she talked on her cell phone, a 17-year-old girl drove
over a curb and through a field before striking a
tree last May in Overland Park. The girl said she
panicked, hitting the gas pedal instead of the brakes. No
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Kaitlyn Tompkins, for one, is nervous about doing anything besides
focusing on the road.
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel very safe driving right now, because I'm a
beginning driver," she said. "I'd rather have all my concentration
so I don't hit someone."
</P>
<P>
Still, she has a problem with a government ban. "It's just
like speeding," she said. "People are going to do it."
</P>
<P>
Some traffic-safety experts say the safety board's proposal is well-intentioned, but
they question its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Enforcement is a big problem," said Russ Rader, a spokesman for
the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research organization that
is funded by auto insurers. "It's difficult for officers to
readily ascertain the age of the driver, and it's difficult
to determine if the driver is using a hands-free phone."
</P>
<P>
The wireless phone industry supports efforts to improve highway safety but
believes they should focus on all potential distractions. "If you
single one possible distraction out, you could be doing a
disservice by creating a false sense of security that you've
taken care of the potential problem," said John Walls, spokesman
for CTIA-the Wireless Association. "Young drivers face a lot of
potential distractions, from playing their music too loudly to other
kids in the car to talking on a cell phone
to eating. The list goes on and on."
</P>
<P>
Capt. Chris Ricks of the Missouri Highway Patrol said education, not
necessarily more laws, is the answer. He said young drivers
must recognize that the distraction is just the start of
what can go wrong.
</P>
<P>
"They don't know how to handle it once they get to
a problem," Ricks said.
</P>
<P>
Brian McKearney, 15, said he was aware of the risk.
</P>
<P>
"When you're talking, you focus more on the conversation than the
road," he said. "There's really no need to talk and
drive. If it can wait, let it wait."

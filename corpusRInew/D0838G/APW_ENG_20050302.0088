<P>
More Americans than ever are driving under the influence of their cell phones,
according to a survey released by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed 8 percent of drivers, or 1.2 million people, were using
hand-held or handsfree cell phones during daylight hours last year, a 50 percent
increase since 2002 and a 100 percent rise in four years.

<P>
All that talking is a potential safety issue, NHTSA spokesman Rae Tyson said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"While we don't have hard evidence that there's been an increase in the number
of crashes, we know that talking on the phone can degrade driver performance,"
Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia prohibit talking on hand-held
cell phones while driving, according to the Governors Highway Safety
Association.
</P>
<P>
Some communities, such as Brookline, Massachusetts, Santa Fe, New Mexico, and
Lebanon, Pennsylvania, require handsfree cell phones, but about a half-dozen
states prohibit local governments from restricting cell phone use in motor
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Young drivers, between 16 and 24, increased their talking on cell phones by 60
percent between 2002 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board said it wants all 50 states to ban
those with learner's permits from using cell phones or other wireless devices
while driving. New Jersey and Maine are the only two that have passed such
laws.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted between June 7 and July 11, 2004, at 1,200 road sites
across the country and, in some cases, supplemented by telephone
surveys.

STATE HOUSE CONSIDERS BANNING CELL PHONE USE WHILE DRIVING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After her family completed their testimony on the
dangers of cell phone use while driving, Kellie Leas walked
over to Michelle Grisham and gave her a hug.
</P>
<P>
As Kellie, 23, walked back to her seat, Michelle, 17, wiped
away tears.
</P>
<P>
"We had never met before," Grisham said. "But when you meet
someone who's been through a similar situation, you feel so
close."
</P>
<P>
Grisham had accompanied her mother, Dorothy Grisham, from Fort Worth to
Austin to testify before the House State Affairs Committee on
Monday on three bills restricting the use of cell phones
while driving.
</P>
<P>
Brandon Grisham died in an automobile accident in 2001. The 18-year-old
lost control of his pickup after swerving to miss another
vehicle that veered into his lane. His mother, Dorothy Grisham,
said a witness told her that the woman in the
other vehicle appeared distracted by her cell phone.
</P>
<P>
"The lady never stopped and is still at large," Dorothy Grisham
told the committee.
</P>
<P>
Kellie Leas, 23, of San Antonio, lost her sister, Erin, in
October 2001, after Erin crashed into a tree while talking
on her cell phone.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Leas, Erin's father, told the panel about his last moments
with her, right before she was taken off life support.
</P>
<P>
"I had my hand on her chest and I could feel
her little heart," he said.
</P>
<P>
The House committee considered four bills on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Three were proposed by state Rep. Jose Menendez, D-San Antonio. Two
would prohibit drivers from using cell phones while driving through
school zones and drivers under 18 from using a cell
phone for the first six months after getting a license.
Those two bills received strong support from experts and no
opposition.
</P>
<P>
A bill proposed by state Rep. Helen Giddings, D-Dallas, to restrict
cell phone use by school bus drivers, also faced no
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Menendez's third bill would bar the use of cell phones while
driving unless the driver is using a hands-free device or
making an emergency call.
</P>
<P>
Only one telecommunications industry lobbyist spoke against that bill.
</P>
<P>
"Hands-free technology is not the silver bullet," Henry Flores, a lobbyist
for Sprint, told the committee. He cited research showing hands-free
devices aren't less distracting for a driver than a handheld
phone.
</P>
<P>
All the cell phone-related bills were held by the committee until
similar legislation now being drafted could be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
Bills under consideration in the Texas House:
</P>
<P>
-- House Bill 236 would prohibit a driver from using a
cell phone while driving through a school zone.
</P>
<P>
-- House Bill 237 would prohibit cell phone use unless a
driver is using a hands-free device or making an emergency
call.
</P>
<P>
-- House Bill 610 would restrict cell phone use by school
bus drivers while operating a bus with passengers.
</P>
<P>
-- House Bill 1094 would prohibit use of a cell phone
by a driver under 18 during the six months period
following issuance of a license.

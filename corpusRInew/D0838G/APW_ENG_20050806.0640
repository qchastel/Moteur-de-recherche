Beginning Monday, Colorado is banning young drivers from talking on cellular
phones while they're behind the wheel _ a small step more states are taking in
hopes of promoting safety without upsetting voters who can't live without the
convenience.
</P>
<P>
The Colorado law affects teens with restricted licenses _ brand-new drivers who
must have an adult drive with them for a year. Police can issue a citation only
if the driver is stopped for another violation.

<P>
This year, 38 states tried to pass legislation restricting cell phones, most
focusing on younger drivers and driving while distracted. Bills were passed or
are still being considered in 22 states, according to the National Conference of
State Legislatures in Denver.
</P>
<P>
So far, only New York, New Jersey, the District of Columbia and Connecticut
prohibit the use of hand-held phones while driving, though other states have
adopted limited restrictions for young drivers or school bus
drivers.
</P>
<P>
Most states are looking at limited bans because it is unclear _ and a bone of
contention with the telecommunications industry _ whether cell phone use while
driving can be tied to more accidents.
</P>
<P>
"For lawmakers, it's a foot in the door," said Matt Sundeen, a policy researcher
with the legislatures group.
</P>
<P>
States are willing to take "baby steps" with younger drivers because it's easier
to get the legislation passed, Sundeen said. He said many lawmakers oppose
stronger laws because they don't want to anger their constituents.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of cell phone bans because a lot of
laws rely on drivers or witnesses to confirm they were talking on the phone when
they had an accident. Sundeen said it is more difficult to prosecute such cases,
unlike drunken driving or failure to use a seat belt where there is often clear
evidence.
</P>
<P>
The cell phone industry says studies show cell phone use was a factor in less
than 1 percent of all accidents in the six states that require
reporting.

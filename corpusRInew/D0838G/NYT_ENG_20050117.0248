JURY IS STILL OUT ON DRIVER-CELL PHONE LAWS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
Christina Arnold was pulled over by a Washington police
officer last summer for driving while talking on her cell
phone without a hands-free device. Hoping to avoid a $100
ticket, Arnold explained to the officer that she had an
important call from her daughter's school and even offered to
show him her telephone record. He declined, she said, and
she managed to get off with just a warning.
</P>
<P>
But thousands of other drivers in Washington the have not been
as lucky.
</P>
<P>
Although only the District of Columbia, New York state and New
Jersey have passed legislation banning the use of hand-held cell
phones while driving, they have issued more than 400,000 tickets
and warnings since New York enacted the first such law
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
In Washington and New York, the hands-free law is a primary
violation, meaning the driver can be pulled over just for
that violation, whereas in New Jersey it is a secondary
offense, which means the driver must be stopped for another
offense.
</P>
<P>
Several other states are considering hand-held bans, including Maryland, which may
prohibit youthful drivers from using cell phones after a spate
of fatal car accidents involving teenage drivers.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, law enforcement officials can issue either a warning ticket
or a $100 citation. But if a cited driver brings
a hands-free device to adjudication, the fine is waived. But
this only works once.
</P>
<P>
Although Arnold, 29, did not get an official warning, she took
the advice of the officer who stopped her and bought
a hands-free device. "It cost only about $59 for the
headset, which is good insurance against any $100 tickets," said
Arnold, who works for a nongovernmental organization. "That's a definite
deterrent never to talk on my phone again."
</P>
<P>
Washington police have been issuing about 600 tickets and 250 warnings
each month since the law was enacted last August. New
York, which has issued more than 360,000 tickets since December
2001, has issued more each year. About 60 percent of
the tickets were issued in New York City.
</P>
<P>
But with cell phone-related incidents only a small percentage of motor
vehicle accidents, even government officials wonder why this particular behavior
was chosen for a law, since studies have shown that
hands-free and hand-held cell phones are equally distracting.
</P>
<P>
"We've evaluated and come to the conclusion that hands-free use is
just as risky or perhaps riskier than hand-held phones because
it's the cognitive distraction that can compromise driving," said Rae
Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Tyson said research from within and outside the agency, along
with driving simulations, had found that it was the talking
on a cell phone while driving that was distracting, and
that therefore cell phones should only be used in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Even the AAA of America, the automobile organization that helped draft
Washington's hands-free law, believes that the real issue is cell
phones, in general, which cause distracted driving, said John B.
Townsend II, manager of public and government relations for AAA
Mid-Atlantic. He cited an AAA analysis of 50 traffic fatalities
over a fixed period of time in the Washington area
that found only two that possibly involved cell phone use.
"In the cosmic scheme of things, it's not just the
cell phone," Townsend said. "We would not come right out
and support a ban on hand-held cell phones. That's not
the issue -- the real issue is distracted drivers."
</P>
<P>
But the laws could be in response to people's fears rather
than fast and hard evidence, Townsend said. A survey by
AAA Mid-Atlantic showed that 63 percent of motorists favored a
ban on driving with hand-held cell phones (76 percent in
Washington), with those favoring bans directed at new teenage drivers
rising to 79 percent. Results of the survey, culled from
1,300 interviews in the Mid-Atlantic area in December 2003, also
showed that 71 percent of drivers felt distracted using a
cell phone while driving.
</P>
<P>
But John Walls, the vice president of public affairs of CTIA,
the Wireless Association, a trade organization representing wireless interests, said
it was unfair and unnecessary to create hands-free laws. "We
question the need for a law singling out behavior that
apparently is pretty far down the pecking order of accidents
in the first place," Walls said. He cited statistics showing
that before 2001, the year the law New York law
was enacted, fewer than a hundredth of 1 percent of
New York City accidents were related to cell phones.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the New York Department of Motor Vehicles,
Joseph Picchi, said that he thought the law was having
an impact but that the department was still compiling statistics.
A report is due by the end of 2005. Picchi
pointed out that the law requiring seat belts in automobiles
had taken years to catch on but now had a
compliance rate of 85 percent. "Cell phones are one of
the bigger distractions while driving," said Picchi said.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Byron Hope, traffic safety coordinator for the Washington Metropolitan Police
Department, said that it was too early to judge the
effectiveness of the law, but that it made people aware
of their driving habits.
</P>
<P>
"There had to be some instances where people's driving was so
bad that this law was sparked," he said. "We're not
saying you can't talk on your cell phone. We just
ask people to use some discretion."

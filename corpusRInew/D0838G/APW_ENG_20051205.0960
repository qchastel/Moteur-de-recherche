Drivers caught using hand-held phones on the road will be fined under a new law
aimed at reducing auto accidents in the U.S. Virgin Islands, officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A first and second offense will carry a fine of between US$25-US$100
(euro21-euro85), while those guilty of a third offense could lose their driver's
license for up to a year, police spokesman Sgt. Thomas Hannah
said.

<P>
The U.S. Caribbean territory of 110,000 residents is the only part of the U.S.
where people drive on the left, a colonial relic from when the territory was
owned by Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The law takes effect Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
"We've talked to (paramedics) who've said there have been so many accidents from
people on cell phones yapping away," said Sen. Roosevelt David, the law's
author, who acknowledged almost hitting another car while using his mobile phone
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
The law allows the use of hands-free mobile phone devices while driving and
hand-held phones during emergencies.

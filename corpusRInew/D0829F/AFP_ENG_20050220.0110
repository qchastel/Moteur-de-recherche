Former US presidents Bill Clinton and

tsunami-battered island nation where nearly 31,000 people perished 
on December 26.

The pair landed at Bandaranaike international airport around 
4:15 pm (1015 GMT) from Indonesia and were due to hold talks later 
in the day with President Chandrika Kumaratunga about tsunami relief 
operations.

The two were received by Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar 
and two other ministers.

On Monday they will visit the town of Matara, 160 kilometres 
(100 miles) south of Colombo, for a brief tour of house 
reconstruction and trauma counseling programs funded by the US 
Agency for International Development.

Bush and Clinton were appointed by President George W. Bush to 
head US private fundraising efforts in the wake of the tsunamis that 
killed at least 288,800 people in 11 countries in Asia and Africa.

Clinton is also the United Nations' special envoy for tsunami

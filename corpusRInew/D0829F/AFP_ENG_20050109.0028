Donations to an Australian tsunami relief 
telethon exceeded 20 million dollars (15.3 million US dollars) 
Sunday as pledges continued to roll in one day after the event.

<P>
World Vision Australia, the charity benefiting from the 
telethon, said it was overwhelmed by the public's response, which 
comes on top of more than 120 million already handed over in private 
donations and a one billion dollar aid package pledged by the 
government.

<P>
"Australians have given more per capita than any other country 
on the earth," World Vision spokeswoman Belinda Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented move, Saturday's telethon and an 
accompanying pop concert at the Sydney Opera House were broadcast 
simultaneously by all three of Australia's normally fiercely 
competitive commercial television stations.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers planned to staff phones throughout Sunday and 
organisers said they hoped the total would rise further.
</P>
<P>
An all-star international cricket match featuring the best of 
Asia versus the rest of the world to be held in Melbourne on Monday 
is expected to raise another five million for tsunami relief.

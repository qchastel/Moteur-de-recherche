<P>
President George W. Bush Saturday 
urged Americans to contribute to charities responding to the tsunami 
disaster, saying he had extended a tax benefit for Americans who 
support such groups.
</P>
<P>
The world is "seeing the good heart of America in an outpouring 
of generosity here at home," Bush said in his weekly radio address. 
"Private citizens are showing their compassion in creative and 
inspiring ways."
</P>
<P>
He noted that he had recruited two former presidents, his 
father, George Bush, and Bill Clinton, "to encourage contributions 
both large and small, directly to the organizations with recovery 
efforts underway in the disaster area.
</P>
<P>
"To encourage support for these groups, I have signed 
legislation allowing Americans to deduct from their 2004 federal 
income tax cash contributions made to tsunami relief efforts this 
month.   I urge all Americans to contribute as they are able."
</P>
<P>
Americans who contribute a certain portion of their income to 
charity can avoid paying taxes on that amount. Under the new law 
donations made to tsunami relief this January can still be deducted 
on tax returns filed for calender year 2004.

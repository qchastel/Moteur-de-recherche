The Tiger Woods Foundation is 
giving 100,000 U.S. dollars to earthquake-tsunami relief efforts 
in Asia, and the PGA Tour is matching that amount.

<P>
Woods' foundation and the tour are donating the money to 
Give2Asia, with the money directed toward two groups aimed at 
providing sanctuary and relief to children affected by the tsunami,
according to reports from Anahelm, California, on Wednesday.

The Rajaprajanukroh Foundation supports children who have been 
orphaned in tsunami-affected provinces. The Holt Sahathai 
Foundation provides services such as adoption, pregnancy 
counseling, foster care, and education for children in hospitals 
and orphanages through Thailand.

Woods' mother was from Thailand, although he said last week 
none of her family was affected by the December 26 tsunami that 
killed more than 150,000 in 11 countries, reports said.

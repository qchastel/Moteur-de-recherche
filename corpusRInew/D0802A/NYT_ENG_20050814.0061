ALASKA'S PERMAFROST IS WARMING

<TEXT>
<P>
Interior Alaska's permafrost has warmed in some places to
the highest level since the ice age ended 10,000 years
ago, its temperature now within a degree or two of
thawing.
</P>
<P>
Earth frozen since woolly mammoths and bison wandered Interior steppes has
been turning to mush. Lakes have been shrinking. Trees are
stressed. Prehistoric ice has melted underground, leaving voids that collapse
into sinkholes.
</P>
<P>
Largely concentrated where people have disturbed the surface, such damage can
be expensive, even heartbreaking. It's happening now in Fairbanks: Toppled
spruce, roller-coaster bike trails, rippled pavement, homes and buildings that
sag into ruin. And the meltdown is spreading in wild
areas: sinkholes, dying trees, eroding lakes.
</P>
<P>
These collapses bode ill: They are omens of what scientists fear
will happen on a large scale across the Arctic if
water and air continue to warm as fast as climate
models predict.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have only some local places where permafrost is
thawing naturally," said expert Vladimir Romanovksy, a Russian-born geophysicist at
the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
"But we are very, very close to this point when it
(all) starts to thaw."
</P>
<P>
After record high temperatures during the summer of 2004 and last
winter's deep insulating snow, Romanovsky said he expects Interior permafrost
will again be significantly warmer than normal this year --
still closer to melting.
</P>
<P>
The Geophysical Institute and Romanovsky maintain the world's most extensive network
of permafrost "observatories" -- basically thermometers sunk deep into the
frozen earth, many along the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. What they
report is disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
Permafrost is shrinking: warming on the bottom from the Earth's natural
heat, warming on the top because of air temperature and
deep snows.
</P>
<P>
It's like holding an ice cream sandwich in your hand on
a sunny day. While the icy center stays hard, it
shrinks as the top and bottom both melt.
</P>
<P>
"Our permafrost is still stable, even though it is very, very
warm," Romanovsky said. "But the moment it starts to thaw,
we will be able to say we are the warmest
we have been the last 100,000 years."
</P>
<P>
For a glimpse of that future, look no farther than the
hills north of Fairbanks, near where Romanovsky lives with his
wife and two of his three sons.
</P>
<P>
In a meadow on his mother-in-law's property, weird six-foot-deep channels and
holes crisscross the ground, trenches and bomb pits from what
amounts to thermal warfare.
</P>
<P>
A small hole opened up in the sod a few years
ago, curving down into the earth like some gopher den.
This spring, his sons and other children playing near the
house discovered the bottom had fallen out. The cavity was
now large enough to bury a person. No one has
crawled down to see where it ends.
</P>
<P>
Romanovksy discourages his sons playing in the field. "It is not
safe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Maybe 100 yards away, other sinkholes have formed along the shoulder
of Goldstream Road, the main travel route for residents of
the rural valley. Romanovksy took photos of his sons by
one hole in 2001 and matched them to another set
taken this spring. In the successive snapshots, the boys grow
taller, the hole grows deeper.
</P>
<P>
The newest chasm -- maybe 10 feet across -- had been
filled with gravel by highway crews. But only a few
weeks later, concentric cracks circled a depression. It looked like
a bull's eye.
</P>
<P>
Romanovsky is part of a small army of scientists investigating Arctic
climate change. He teaches UAF college students, conducts research with
the International Arctic Research Center and hopes to expand ground
frost monitoring to other parts of the world with a
grant from the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Since emigrating from Moscow in 1990, Romanovksy has found that Fairbanks
offers a kind of paradise for a family man/permafrost scientist
-- a middle-class paycheck in a small town surrounded by
frozen ground.
</P>
<P>
Now 51 and a naturalized U.S. citizen, he still has a
bulldog build from his days as a hockey defenseman for
Moscow State University. He has two Ph.D.s, with training in
mathematics, geology and the physics of how frozen dirt sheds
heat.
</P>
<P>
Permafrost experts once labored in obscurity, he said. Graduate students were
drawn to more glamorous topics, like glaciers and sea ice.
</P>
<P>
After all, he said, "permafrost is frozen dirt."
</P>
<P>
But the importance of permafrost as an indicator of climate change
-- and the realization that its thaw could alter the
northern landscape and release vast stores of greenhouse gases into
the air -- has ignited huge interest.
</P>
<P>
"It's just exploded since last year," said Romanovsky, who starred in
a recent New Yorker piece on global warming. "I'm going
to have to stop giving interviews."
</P>
<P>
Permafrost degradation is only one element in a climate shift well
under way. Overall, during the last half century, the Arctic
has been warming much faster than the rest of the
world. Alaska's average annual air temperature has increased 3.3 degrees
between 1949 and 2003, with some areas rising almost twice
as much, especially in winter and fall, according to the
Arctic Climate Impact Assessment published last fall.
</P>
<P>
The most obvious signs are shrinking sea ice, melting glaciers and
the thawing trend in permafrost, said Syun Akasofu, director of
the Arctic research center, in a briefing this spring with
Floyd DesChamps, a staffer of the U.S. Senate Commerce committee.
</P>
<P>
While warming is definitely happening, the causes remain unclear. Natural climate
cycles that reach back thousands of years and greenhouse gases
released by human activity both appear to be driving the
warmth. But researchers still do not know which factors contribute
more, Akasofu said.
</P>
<P>
Romanovsky warns that, whatever the reason, permafrost is easing closer to
the thawing point across Interior Alaska. Will spruce forests transform
into grassland? Will roads, buildings and pipelines collapse? Will Alaskans
be forced to spend millions repairing damage?
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain, he said. "The permafrost we have was
established during the last ice age, and now it's deteriorating."

Arctic countries meet on threat of global warming

<P>
A group of countries which 
fringe the Arctic waters of the Barents Sea gathered in Norway on 
Thursday and heard that they must go beyond the UN's Kyoto protocol 
to reduce greenhouse emissions.
</P>
<P>
"We have not done enough considering the magnitude of the 
challenge," Finnish foreign minister Erkki Tuomioja told a meeting 
of the Barents council, which groups Russia, Norway, Sweden, 
Finland, Denmark, Iceland as well as the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Arctic's atmosphere is warming twice as fast as elsewhere on 
earth, and experts have warned that the region's ice could melt away 
completely by the end of this century, endangering many animal 
species and the traditional lifestyle of Inuits and Lapplanders.
</P>
<P>
The UN's Kyoto treaty commits 39 industrial nations and 
territories to trim their output of six greenhouse gases -- 
especially carbon dioxide -- on average by five percent between 2008 
and 2012, compared with 1990 levels. 
</P>
<P>
Its impact has however been limited, partly because the world's 
biggest polluter nation the United States refused to sign up.
</P>
<P>
But already, the Kyoto protocol "is not enough", Tuomioja 
charged. "We are already starting with the post-Kyoto issues."
</P>
<P>
Countries still dragging their feet, like the US, China and 
India, should be persuaded to contribute to these efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's trade and industry minister, Thomas Oestros, called on 
the other delegates to follow the lead of his country, which is 
hoping to become independent of fossil fuels by 2020, by developing 
the use of biofuels.
</P>
<P>
Conference host Norway, the world's third-largest oil exporter, 
also said the Kyoto protocol needed to be respected and that new 
measures after 2012 had to be envisaged already.
</P>
<P>
Norway plans to finance research into greenhouse emission 
recycling, and is currently studying the possibility of injecting 
carbon dioxide produced on land into offshore hydrocarbon fields, an 
environmentally-friendly measure which would also increase the 
productivity of North Sea oil and gas platforms.

<P>
Leaders of the Arctic region's indigenous people on Friday urged European
countries to step up the fight against global warming, saying it is threatening
their societies, economies and cultures.
</P>
<P>
The eight-nation Arctic Council said the annual average amount of sea ice around
the North Pole has decreased about 8 percent in 30 years because of global
warming fueled by greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
"There is some tough sledding ahead to make the rest of the cuts in greenhouse
gases that will be needed," said Chief Gary Harrison, a council member, at a
meeting in Copenhagen. He urged European nations to lower emissions beyond
what's required under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, which took effect in February, commits participating
industrialized nations to reduce their combined greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2
percent below 1990 levels by 2012. The treaty has been ratified by at least 140
nations.
</P>
<P>
The council believes temperatures in the Arctic will increase 3 degrees Celsius
(5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2080.
</P>
<P>
"To some, that's just the difference between putting a jacket on and off," said
Clive Tesar, of the council's Indigenous Peoples' Secretariat. "But 3 degrees is
a major change for the ecosystem, for animals, for plants, for peoples that have
adapted to a particular temperature."
</P>
<P>
The softening permafrost has already driven some polar animals further north.
There are fears that polar bears and some seal species could face extinction in
just decades because of global warming.
</P>
<P>
Global warming also has an impact on infrastructures that are built on
permafrost.
</P>
<P>
"If it stays hard like concrete, that is not a problem, you can build anything
you like on it," Tesar said. "But it starts to melt (and) creates a little bit
of a problem. Houses start to lean, pipelines rupture and roads fall
apart."
</P>
<P>
The indigenous leaders were in Berlin earlier this week and will travel to
Brussels, Belgium, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking each country in the world to examine if it is truly doing its
part to slow climate change," said Larisa Abryutina of the Russian Association
of Indigenous Peoples of the North, which is part of the Arctic
Council.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the only Arctic region country that has not adopted the Kyoto
treaty, says the restrictions are flawed and could hurt its economy.
</P>
<P>
The Arctic region is home to about 4 million people, including more than 30
different indigenous groups.
</P>
<P>
Created in 1996, the Arctic Council _ which comprises Canada, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States _ is a regional
partnership for sustainable development.

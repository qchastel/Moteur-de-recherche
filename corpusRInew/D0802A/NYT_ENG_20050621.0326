THE RACE TO SEE ALASKA BEFORE IT MELTS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They stood and gawked at the great blue mass of shrinking
ice. Behold: a frozen landscape giving it up to a
midnight sunset. The scene at the receding edge of the
Exit Glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park in Alaska was
part festive gathering, part nature tour with an apocalyptic edge.
Dressed in tank tops and shorts -- beachwear, in fact
-- on this freakishly warm day in early June, people
moved ever closer to the rope line near the glacier
as it shied away, practically groaning and melting before their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
A product of the late ice age, the glacier looked old
and tired on this hot day. There was a sense
of loss, some people said, at watching this giant recoil.
There were oohs and aahs but also more hushed tones,
expressions of fear that the big land was somehow diminished,
a little less wild. Just a few years ago, the
spot where these tourists stood, on dry ground marked by
Park Service signs, had been under ice.
</P>
<P>
Alaska is changing by the hour. From the far north, where
higher seas are swamping native villages, to the tundra around
Fairbanks, where melting permafrost is forcing some roads and structures
to buckle in what looks like a cartoon version of
a hangover, to the rivers of ice receding from inlets,
warmer temperatures are remaking the Last Frontier State.
</P>
<P>
That transformation was particularly apparent at the visitor center here, where
rangers were putting the finishing touches on a display that
sought to explain the changing landscape of the country's northernmost
state. The sign said, "Glimpses of an Ice Age past.
Laboratory of climate change today," and it explained how the
Exit Glacier has been shrinking over the years, and what
scientists are learning as the state heats up.
</P>
<P>
Out in the fjords, kayakers paddled into bays newly opened by
other receding glaciers. They came to see the ice, a
tour guide explained, to paddle around something that had been
moving toward a tidewater destiny for thousands of years. And
many of them were in a hurry. Glacial pace, in
Alaska, no longer means slow.
</P>
<P>
"Things are melting pretty fast around here," said Jim Ireland, the
chief ranger for Kenai Fjords. Climate change, he said, "has
become one of the major new themes for this park."
</P>
<P>
In ambition, in the scale of its scenic extremes, in the
pure size and wonder of its fish and wildlife, Alaska
has never been anything less than flamboyant. It is, after
all, more than two times the size of Texas, with
a shoreline, more than 33,000 miles, that exceeds that of
all other states combined. And as Alaska morphs through a
period of warmer weather, it is doing so with characteristic
extravagance.
</P>
<P>
The old Alaska, the Alaska of forbidden expanses and adrenaline-surging encounters
with brawnier ends of the food chain, still exists of
course. But a larger drama -- of this land losing
some of its icy inheritance -- is playing out as
well.
</P>
<P>
The sea-level edge of the Exit Glacier, just outside the town
of Seward and one of the most visited bodies of
ice in the north, has receded by nearly 1,000 feet
over the last 10 years, park rangers say. In Prince
William Sound and farther south in Glacier Bay National Park,
where the cruise ship industry does a thriving business based
on active walls of ice, many glaciers have pulled their
toes out of the water and shriveled up the valleys.
This process has created another attraction: the instant landscape. Take
away the ice, add rain and sunshine to the debris
left behind and, presto, Stage 1 of creation.
</P>
<P>
To some visitors who fear that global warming is to blame
for the accelerated pace of change, there is a sense
of urgency in their travel planning. They seem to be
fearful that if they don't get to Alaska soon, they
will never see the full glory of the state's frozen
magnificence.
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we hear a lot from people is
that they want to see Alaska before it's gone," said
Hugh Rose, a tour guide, geologist and photographer who lives
in Fairbanks. "The melting, the warmer temperatures, the changing patterns
of wildlife and the land -- they've become huge topics
of conversation among guides and our clients."
</P>
<P>
Of course, Alaska is not going anywhere, at least not right
away. About 4 percent of the state is ice. One
glacier, the Malaspina, is larger than Rhode Island, and another,
the Harding Icefield, which feeds the Exit Glacier, is nearly
half that size. If all of Alaska's glaciers were joined
in one mass, it would be bigger than 10 of
the states.
</P>
<P>
But the Great Land is definitely getting warmer. Last year was
abnormally hot in the usually wet and cool southeastern part
of the state, where cruise ships ply the Inside Passage.
Anchorage, Fairbanks, Nome and Juneau all posted their warmest summers
on record. More wildfires burned in 2004 than any other
year on file. And by early May of this year,
the woods were ablaze on the Kenai Peninsula, and the
preternaturally quirky residents of Homer were gardening in cutoffs --
at a time when snow was still falling in Detroit
and Boston.
</P>
<P>
This year, Rose noticed something odd during the annual spring birding
trek he leads to the Copper River Delta, famous for
its rich, high-priced wild salmon runs. He takes people to
the delta to watch masses of western sandpipers that have
migrated north from winter havens in Central and South America.
The birds, and people who pay to watch them, have
brought an infusion of tourism cash to the fishing village
of Cordova, which highlights the migration with an annual shorebird
festival. The event has traditionally been held on the second
weekend in May; last year it was moved to the
first weekend of the month. "There used to be 100,000
birds on the second weekend in May," said Rose. "Now
you'll miss most of them if you don't arrive earlier."
</P>
<P>
The question of exactly how much warmer Alaska is than "normal"
-- and whether it is part of human-caused changes in
the temperature brought on by increased greenhouse gases or something
natural and cyclical -- can start a decent bar fight
in any fishing harbor.
</P>
<P>
"It is probable the last decade was warmer than any other"
since records have been kept, the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment
reported on Nov. 24, 2004. The study is a project
of nations including Denmark, Canada and the United States. The
Bush administration, which has been cautious about blaming global warming
for any Alaskan changes, cites rising spring temperatures, loss of
sea and glacial ice, melting permafrost and conversion of some
parts of the soggy tundra into brushy wetlands among the
changes taking place.
</P>
<P>
But to many Alaskans, global warming is not an abstraction or
a theory. At least four native villages in the far
north may have to move inland or to higher ground
to avoid being swept away by erosion from the sea
-- a consequence, the villagers say, of early-melting sea ice
that contributes to shore erosion. The melting ice may also
affect polar bears, and whales, who live off the sea
life beneath the ice.
</P>
<P>
None of this has deterred people from coming to Alaska. If
anything, say many guides and tour operators, warming temperatures have
brought more people, and the Alaska Travel Industry Association is
projecting a strong year, surpassing last year's 1.45 million visitors.
And while travel industry officials say they are not exactly
marketing the warmer temperatures around a "See Alaska Now" campaign,
they say some travelers are driven by concern about the
fate of the Great Land in a warmer world. "Our
clients are really interested in this," said John Page, who
runs Sunny Cove Sea Kayaking Co. in Seward. "Everyone wants
to know: Is the ice retreating because of global warming?
How's this going to change Alaska?"
</P>
<P>
For tourists, it can mean a thrill at seeing a landscape
more dynamic than any place on earth -- global warming
on hyperspeed! -- or disappointment that something so wild and
massive is, well, shrinking.
</P>
<P>
Both reactions were evident at Portage Lake, about 50 miles south
of Anchorage. Tour buses packed the parking lot of the
big, well-staffed Begich, Boggs Visitor Center. This is where people
come by the thousands to see Portage Glacier, one of
the most accessible of Alaska's frozen attractions. Except, you can
no longer see Portage Glacier from the visitor center. It
has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The most persistent question to rangers at the station was: Dude,
where did Portage Glacier go? A display inside showed that
just 11 years ago, the glacier descended down to the
end of the lake. But now it is around a
distant corner and at the back of the lake, completely
out of sight from the center. A video featured a
Forest Service scientist, Kristine Crossen, who explained that the glacier
had been retreating about 165 feet a year. "We have
good evidence that the climate is warming in Alaska," she
says.
</P>
<P>
Visitors were perplexed. Gordon Middleton drove up to Portage Lake in
his camper, from his home in Anacortes, Wash. He is
retired from a life on factory floors and fishing boats.
For him, ice is the draw.
</P>
<P>
"I've been watching glaciers so long I'm called the Ice Man
by some of my friends," said Middleton. He aimed his
camera across the lake from a roadside perch and zoomed
in, looking for Portage Glacier.
</P>
<P>
"It's supposed to be there," he said, pointing to a shoreline
of rocky moraine, the detritus left behind by retreating ice.
"But I don't see anything."
</P>
<P>
Virtually every visitor center built around a glacier or a blue
wall hugging a mountain cliff has its landmarks to warmer
temperatures. Just outside of Juneau, the Mendenhall Glacier, which is
about 12 miles in length, has gradually pulled away from
near the parking lot and up the lake. It is
still a prime visitor site for people who are bused
from cruise ships in port. But for some cruise passengers
who have seen the glacier before, the changes are stunning.
</P>
<P>
"I saw the Mendenhall Glacier 25 years ago, and it has
really pulled back since then," said Mark Stringer, who is
from Arizona and was visiting Alaska by cruise ship. "But
you know, this is a dynamic process. It's a blip
in time. We don't know what's going to happen."
</P>
<P>
In Glacier Bay National Park, the ice has been shrinking since
at least the time of Capt. George Vancouver's visit, more
than 200 years ago. What are now bays filled with
whale-watching kayakers and iceberg-viewing cruise passengers were full of glaciers
in the late 1700s, officials say. And what was once
bare rock at the edge of the ice to Captain
Vancouver's crew is now part of a lush rain forest.
But the pace of ice age retreat has greatly accelerated
in recent years. Government photos show that Muir Glacier, one
of the park's prime attractions, has receded by more than
five miles in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"The big story around here is the retreat of Muir Glacier,"
said Dave Nemeth, the park's chief of concessions. "But all
around the park, there are constant changes going on."
</P>
<P>
For many amateur photographers on a first visit to Alaska, the
money shot is a glacier calving into the water. And
with these tidewater glaciers disappearing from places like Prince William
Sound and Kenai Fjords, it has prompted some urgent travel
advisories for people to hurry before those shots disappear.
</P>
<P>
"If you ever wanted to take an Alaskan cruise to see
glaciers, do it sooner rather than later for the best
views," wrote Bob Martin, who runs a Web site called
the Inquisitive Traveler.
</P>
<P>
But people in the cruise ship industry say it is hard
to gauge exactly how many visitors are coming to Alaska
now out of a sense of concern that Alaska is
melting away. "We know glaciers are one of the top
five reasons why people travel to Alaska," said Noel DeChambeau,
a marketing director at Holland America, the cruise line company.
"They want to see natural wonders. And I don't get
a sense that the natural wonders are going away any
time soon."
</P>
<P>
But DeChambeau did note that Holland America's overland trip to the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which Congress and President Bush plan
to open to oil drilling, sold out early this year.
Other tour operators also report a surge of interest in
travel within the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
"Some people are clueless or they say, 'Cool -- your summers
are getting longer,"' said Rose, the Fairbanks guide who leads
tours to the Arctic. "But for every one of them,
we get a client genuinely concerned that Alaska is changing
too quickly, and they want to see it while they
can."
</P>
<P>
In the town of Seward, which seems to have a disproportionate
number of people who dine with baseball hats emblazoned with
a fishing hook and the slogan "Bite Me," residents are
of two minds about the warming weather.
</P>
<P>
Up at Exit Glacier, a man who told everyone his name
was Pete and said he lived in Seward was holding
forth, telling people that just five years ago he could
reach out and touch the glacier from where he stood,
a good 300 yards from the edge of the ice
now.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back in town, tour guides were doing a brisk business
during a week when people were wearing Hawaiian shirts and
lathering on the sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
"I've lived here 22 years, and the changes I've seen are
tremendous," said Page, the Seward kayaking guide. "The summers are
much warmer and sunnier. We see things like white-sided dolphins,
which don't normally appear in these waters. It certainly has
not hurt business. But on a planetary level, I'm concerned."
</P>
<P>
Other Alaskans are trying to take the long view -- enjoying
the rush of visitors to see a land shaking off
much of its frozen past.
</P>
<P>
"I'm 64 years old, so I'm not too worried it's all
going to melt in my time," said Charlie Clements, who
runs the Blue Heron BB, in Gustavus, just outside Glacier
Bay National Park. "But I have noticed a lot of
changes. We aren't getting as much snow. And the summers,
they've been really warm."
</P>
<P>
His bed-and-breakfast, which is planted in one of the wettest places
on the planet, within miles of some of the world's
biggest glaciers, now has an added feature: a sunroom. It
is no longer a joke.

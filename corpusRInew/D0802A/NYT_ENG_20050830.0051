WARMING TALES OF THE ARCTIC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Arctic is on thin ice. And explorer Lonnie Dupre has
harrowing firsthand stories to prove it.
</P>
<P>
Dupre, 44, of Grand Marais, Minn., attempted the first summer crossing
of the Arctic Ocean in May to highlight the dangers
of global warming. Working with Greenpeace, a nonprofit organization focused
on solving environmental problems, Dupre and explorer Eric Larsen, 34,
also of Grand Marais, left Siberia for the North Pole
on May 12 with two canoe-sleds.
</P>
<P>
But their expedition was cut short because of heavy rainfall and
other conditions they did not expect until mid-July: Temperatures reached
40 degrees, breaking the ice, and strong currents flowed south,
making it difficult to walk, paddle, or ski.
</P>
<P>
On good days, they would travel eight to 12 miles, but
when they slept, drifting ice pushed them back the same
distance or more. The team, which finally had to be
airlifted out, plans to try again next spring.
</P>
<P>
Until then, Dupre plans to tour the United States to share
details of his voyage, stress the threat of global warming,
and show support for nature as a primary energy source.
(He's a fan of the proposed Cape Cod wind farm.)
</P>
<P>
The idea for the expedition came in 2001 during a 6,500-mile
trip around Greenland. A 1982 map showed an area where
two glaciers jutted a mile out to sea. When Dupre
reached the spot, the glaciers were not there.
</P>
<P>
It turned out the location was right, he said, but the
glaciers had receded - a mile inland.
</P>
<P>
Dupre plans to leave in April 2006 for his next Arctic
expedition, three weeks earlier than he left this year, and
with a little more insight about the effects of global
warming.
</P>
<P>
"It's starting to snowball," he said. "When the ice is gone,
we're going to be in a world of hurt."IF YOU

<P>
Dupre is scheduled to speak about his adventures at Cape Cod
Community College in Barnstable Sept. 6 at 6:30 p.m. and
to endorse the proposed Cape Cod wind farm, a project
to install 130 energy-efficient wind turbines in Nantucket Sound.
</P>
<P>
Also, Larsen will be touring New England next month aboard Greenpeace's
Arctic Sunrise, a 170-foot ice-breaker. The ship, which has been
traveling around Greenland to observe the effects of global warming,
will be open for tours at the Boston Harbor Shipyard
and Marina, 256 Marginal St., on Sept. 17 and 18,
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The ship will then travel to various New England ports, and
is scheduled to reach Nantucket on Sept. 25. Call 800-219-9260
or check www.projectthinice.org for more information, and to confirm dates
and times. The ship is not accessible to wheelchairs and
has lots of steep stairs.

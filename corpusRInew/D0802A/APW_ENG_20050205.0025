Researchers probe Antarctica's shifting ice, `not sure what's going on'

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists looking southward from the tip of South America, over steel-gray
waters toward icy Antarctica, see only questions on the horizon about the fate
of the planet.
</P>
<P>
Now that one mammoth Antarctic ice shelf has collapsed into the ocean, when
might another, bigger one crumble and slip into a warming sea? In 1,000 years?
In 100 years? Sooner? Never?
</P>
<P>
"People don't have the answer to the question yet _ what the probability is of
that collapse, if any," said scientist Gino Casassa. "But there's some
indication of instability."
</P>
<P>
Casassa and fellow Chilean researchers had just flown back from the icy
continent to this expedition staging point, and brought with them some
potentially unsettling news.
</P>
<P>
On a two-month roundtrip trek by snow tractor to the South Pole, they pointed
their sophisticated radar at the ground and found that the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet may be thicker than thought, many hundreds of feet (meters) thicker in
parts.
</P>
<P>
Glaciologists like Casassa worry most about that western ice sheet, half a
continent of frozen water believed enough, if gradually melted, to raise ocean
levels worldwide by about five meters (15 feet).
</P>
<P>
That would be a slow-motion catastrophe for global coastlines _ not instantly
deadly like a tsunami, but more universal and permanent. And "the deeper the
West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the greater the potential impact to sea level,"
Casassa pointed out, though cautioning that their data awaits full
analysis.
</P>
<P>
Such pressing questions about the white continent and global warming _ and the
impact each will have on the other _ are consuming more and more scientific
resources these days, as hundreds of researchers migrate south in the southern
summer to probe, measure and observe in an on-the-ice search for
answers.
</P>
<P>
Advanced technology, like the radar lent by the University of Kansas, allows
scientists to penetrate darker corners of polar science. ICESat, a NASA
satellite launched two years ago, is giving them an unprecedentedly precise look
at the state of the ice in both the Arctic and Antarctic. The same U.S. space
agency, meanwhile, is boosting the power of its supercomputers to speed through
millions of calculations to foresee temperature, evaporation, precipitation and
other changes far into the future, using complex climate models.
</P>
<P>
The challenges remain huge, however, on the globe's most forbidding landscape.
And technology sometimes fails. One of the ice-surveying satellite's laser eyes
went dead, for one thing, reducing its useful data by more than half. For
another, the vast continent has too few permanent monitoring stations to give
scientists more than a sketchy grasp of its climate behavior.
</P>
<P>
"Even now, we're not so sure what's going on in all Antarctica. There aren't
sufficient data," said Argentina's Pedro Skvarca, a veteran Antarctic
glaciologist.
</P>
<P>
The hunt for data took on fresh urgency after Antarctica's "Larsen B," an ice
shelf bigger than Luxembourg, collapsed into the Southern Ocean over the space
of just 35 days in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The 3,380 square kilometers (1,300 square miles) of ice had fringed the
Antarctic Peninsula, a rocky arm of land that reaches north to within 750 miles
of this southernmost Chilean city. In that peninsular region, average surface
temperatures have risen by 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) over 50
years.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures globally rose about 0.6 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) in
the past century, most of that attributed by scientific consensus to the
accumulation in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other warming "greenhouse
gases," mostly from fossil fuel-burning. It hasn't been established whether the
Antarctic Peninsula warming stems directly from global warming, or from more
localized conditions.
</P>
<P>
Because an ice "shelf" already floats on the sea, displacing its weight in
water, Larsen B's disintegration _ and that of the smaller, nearby Larsen A in
1995 _ didn't raise ocean levels. But what has happened since
did.
</P>
<P>
Skvarca and American researchers, collating aerial reconnaissance with ICESat
images, reported last September that land-based glaciers backed up behind Larsen
B have accelerated their flow since its break-up _ moving ice into the sea up to
eight times faster than before.
</P>
<P>
Now scientists are warily watching the Larsen C ice shelf, farther south and 20
times larger.
</P>
<P>
Like the B sector before it collapsed, "Larsen C also appears to be thinning,"
said Robert Thomas, a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center facility
in Virginia. "It's quite possible that the thinning is the precursor to the
breakup."
</P>
<P>
Scientists expect Larsen C to disintegrate sometime in this century, Skvarca
said in a telephone interview from Buenos Aires. "We should bear in mind what is
happening to the Larsen ice shelves, because if it also happens to a big shelf,
we are going to be in trouble," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Big" refers to the floating giants _ the Ross and Ronne ice shelves. Each is
around 520,000 square kilometers (200,000 square miles). They lie deeper south
in a more frigid zone, are thicker in depth and hold back immense streams of ice
coming from the heights of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the
1,760-kilometers-wide (1,100-mile-wide), 2,700-meter-high (9,000-foot-high) dome
that sits atop continental rock.
</P>
<P>
No one has spotted signs of instability yet in the two giant shelves. But
scientists also worry about what Thomas calls the "back door" _ a stretch of
Antarctic coast whose glaciers feed off the western ice sheet directly into the
Amundsen Sea, or into small ice shelves on that sea.
</P>
<P>
"There's some indication of instability in the Amundsen Sea," Casassa
said.
</P>
<P>
Casassa, Thomas and colleagues have watched the "back door" since the early
1990s, most recently via satellite tracking. They reported in the journal
Science last September that a half-dozen glaciers there are now thinning and
accelerating. The big Pine Island glacier is carrying ice faster toward the sea
as much as 298 kilometers (186 miles) inland, deep within the western ice
sheet.
</P>
<P>
"The instability and changes are migrating inland," Casassa said. "This could
affect the whole of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, because the ice sheet `feels'
what is happening at the coast."
</P>
<P>
Glaciologists are quick to point out they've found no basis for fearing an
imminent, massive collapse of ice into the southern seas. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, a U.N.-organized network of scientists, concluded in a
2001 assessment that the impact of global warming "will be realized slowly" in
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
Although scientists assume major change might take a millennium, much remains
unknown about the links among ice, ocean and skies.
</P>
<P>
It isn't known, for example, how excess amounts of cold, fresh water from
glaciers, pouring into the salty sea, will affect the ocean current that circles
Antarctica from west to east _ a main driver of all the world's ocean currents,
and hence of world climate.
</P>
<P>
Antarctica's own climate, meanwhile, may be verging on change.
</P>
<P>
Factors including the seasonal Antarctic "ozone hole" of recent decades are
believed to have held temperatures in the interior stable while the world
warmed. But NASA climatologists recently reported that a computer model study
indicates things may rapidly reverse toward warming in Antarctica, in part
because an international ban on ozone-destroying substances is expected to
restore the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
Drew Shindell of NASA said "there's a lot of room for improvement in the
modeling" _ in upper-atmosphere dynamics, for example, including the chemistry
of ozone.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get that kind of modeling. We have new computers, 10 times
bigger," he said by telephone from his New York office.
</P>
<P>
In powerful computers, by satellite and on the Antarctic ice, the stepped-up
search for answers will go on.
</P>
<P>
Like others, Skvarca sees a need for a bigger, better coordinated international
effort. The Argentine scientist recalled the "premonitory" work of the late Ohio
State University glaciologist John Mercer, who forecast in the 1970s that
warming would cause the Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves to disintegrate, from
north to south.
</P>
<P>
At the time, "nobody paid much attention," Skvarca said. "Let's not wait 30
years more to see whether Larsen C and others disintegrate. There's an urgent
need for research now."

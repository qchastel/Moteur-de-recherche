<P>
A two-week conference on the 
Antarctic, focusing on environmental, climate change and tourism 
issues, opened on Monday with representatives of 50 governments, 
researchers and experts, the Swedish hosts said.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which runs to June 17, comes amid fresh warnings 
from scientists about the effect of climate change on Antarctica, 
the fifth largest continent in the world, which contains more than 
90 percent of the world's ice.
</P>
<P>
Sweden hopes that the meeting will result in a special protocol 
on responsibility and insurance in the case of major accidents in 
the Antarctic, such as oil spills.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that there are great expectations for our 
discussions," Swedish environment minister Lena Sommestad told the 
TT news agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Other topics are the environmental impact of increasing tourism 
in the Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is important for people to visit the 
Antarctic, but it is also important that we are aware of the 
consequences," Sommestad said.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the special role the Antarctic plays for the world's 
climate, a treaty was signed by 12 nations in 1959 stipulating that 
it is in "the interest of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue 
for ever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not 
become the scene or object of international discord".
</P>
<P>
The treaty now has 44 signatories, of which 27 are full members 
controlling the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries, including Argentina, Chile and Britain, 
claim territory in Antarctica as their own, but the treaty calls for 
sovereignty issues to be put aside, and they will not be discussed 
at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Last month, scientists again sounded an alarm bell on the effect 
of global warming on Antarctica, saying that more than 200 coastal 
glaciers are in retreat because of higher temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Of the 244 marine glaciers that drain inland ice on the 
Antarctic peninsula, a region previously identified as vulnerable to 
global warming, 87 percent have fallen back over the last half 
century, according to research by British experts.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear whether the man-made "greenhouse effect", caused 
by the burning of fossil fuels, is entirely to blame, they said.
</P>
<P>
If even a small part of this cap melts, rising sea levels could 
drown low-lying island states, cities and deltas, they warned.

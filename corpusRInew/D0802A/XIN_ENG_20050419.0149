Arctic icecap to melt completely by 2080, scientist

A Chinese scientist predicted 
that the icecap of the Arctic area in summer will totally 
disappear if the current melting speed remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhanhai, director of Polar Research Institute of China, 
said that the melting rate of Arctic ice is "alarming" -- with the
ice area shrinking by 10 percent and the thickness by 42 percent 
over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"If this situation keeps unchanged, the world should be 
prepared for a more sizzling summer," Zhang warned at the ongoing 
seventh Arctic Science Summit Week (ASSW), being held in Kunming, 
capital city of southwest China's Yunnan Province, from April 18 
to 24.
</P>
<P>
China is a Northern Hemisphere country with sophisticated 
natural and environmental variations and any changes take place in
Arctic area will directly affect the climate of China, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said, the cold front that affects China mainly comes from
Siberia, but the source of the cold front is Arctic. "To some 
extent, Arctic is an 'air conditioner' of countries in the North 
Hemisphere," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"With more ice melting and the shrinking of permafrost, the 
Northern Hemisphere countries will experience more awful weather,"
said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The direct influence of Arctic on the climate in Northern 
Hemisphere countries has remained a top concern of experts 
attending the summit.
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1999, the summit has become a platform where 
experts from various countries exchange views and Arctic research 
achievements, covering influence of human activities, ocean 
ecology, climatic changes, mechanism of polar climate formation, 
among others.
</P>
<P>
China has contributed many efforts to study the polar regions, 
including the sporadic observation activities since 1990s and the 
latest establishment of Yellow River observation site in Norway in
July, 2004.
</P>
<P>
The melting of Arctic ice will not only be a sign of threat, it
is also a good news, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"It is at least a good news for ocean shipping," said Zhang. "
We can cut the journey  by one-third by traveling directly to the 
Atlantic via the Bering Strait Gateway and via the Arctic Ocean."

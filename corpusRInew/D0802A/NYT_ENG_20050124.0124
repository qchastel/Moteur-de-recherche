WARMING ANTARCTICA LOOKS EVER MORE VULNERABLE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
OVER THE ABBOTT ICE SHELF, Antarctica
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From an airplane at
500 feet, all that is visible here is a vast
white emptiness. Ahead, a chalky plain stretches as far as
the eye can see, the monotony broken only by a
few gentle rises and the wrinkles created when new sheets
of ice form.
</P>
<P>
Under the surface of that ice, though, profound and potentially troubling
changes are taking place, and at a quickened pace. With
temperatures climbing in parts of Antarctica in recent years, melt
water seems to be penetrating deeper and deeper into ice
crevices, weakening immense and seemingly impregnable formations that have developed
over thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, huge glaciers in this and other remote areas
of Antarctica are thinning and ice shelves the size of
American states are either disintegrating or retreating -- all possible
indications of global warming. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey
reported in December that in some parts of the Antarctic
Peninsula hundreds of miles from here, large growths of grass
are appearing in places that until recently were hidden under
a frozen cloak.
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is piling up; everything fits," Robert Thomas, a glaciologist
from NASA who is the lead author of a recent
paper on accelerating sea-level rise, said as the Chilean navy
plane flew over the sea ice here on an unusually
clear day late in November. "Around the Amundsen Sea, we
have surveyed a half dozen glaciers. All are thinning, in
some cases quite rapidly, and in each case, the ice
shelf is also thinning."
</P>
<P>
The relationship between glaciers (essentially frozen rivers) and ice shelves (thick
plates of ice protruding from the land and floating on
the ocean) is complicated and not fully understood. But scientists
compare the spot where the "tongue" of a glacier flows
to the sea in the form of an ice shelf
to a cork in a bottle. When the ice shelf
breaks up, this can allow the inland ice to accelerate
its march to the sea.
</P>
<P>
"By themselves, the tongue of the glacier or the cork in
the bottle do not represent that much," said Claudio Teitelboim,
the director of the Center for Scientific Studies, a private
Chilean institution that is the partner of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration in surveying the ice fields of Antarctica
and Patagonia. "But once the cork is dislodged, the contents
of the bottle flow out, and that can generate tremendous
instability."
</P>
<P>
Glaciologists also know that by itself, free-floating sea ice does not
raise the level of the sea, just as an ice
cube in a glass of water does not cause an
overflow as it melts. But glaciers are different because they
rest on land, and if that vast volume of ice
slides into the sea at a high rate, this adds
mass to the ocean, which in turn can raise the
global sea level.
</P>
<P>
With flights over this and other areas of Antarctica, NASA and
the Chilean center hope to help glaciologists and other scientists
interested in climate change understand what is taking place on
the frigid continent and why. To do that, they need
to compile data not only on ice thicknesses but also
on the underlying geology of the region, information most easily
obtained from the air.
</P>
<P>
The flights are taking place aboard a Chilean navy Orion P-3
plane that has been specially equipped with sophisticated instruments. The
devices include a laser-imaging system that shoots 5,000 pulses of
light per second at the ground to map the ice
surface, as well as ice-penetrating radar to determine the depth
of the ice sheets, a magnetometer and digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
For most parts of Antarctica, reliable records go back less than
50 years, and data from satellites and overflights like the
ones going on here have been collected over only the
past decade or so. But that research, plus striking changes
that are visible to the naked eye, all point toward
the disturbance of climate patterns thought to have been in
place for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, for instance, the Larsen A ice shelf disintegrated, followed
in 1998 by the collapse of the nearby Wilkins ice
shelf. Over a 35-day period early in 2002, at the
end of the Southern Hemisphere summer, the Larsen B ice
shelf shattered, losing more than a quarter of its total
mass and setting thousands of icebergs adrift in the Weddell
Sea.
</P>
<P>
"The response time scale of ice dynamics is a lot shorter
than we used to think it was," said Robert Bindschadler,
a NASA scientist who is director of the West Antarctic
Ice Sheet Initiative. "We don't know what the exact cause
is, but what we observe going on today is likely
to be what is also happening tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Thus far, all of the ice shelves that have collapsed are
on the Antarctic peninsula -- a collection of islands, mountain
ranges and glaciers that jut northward toward Argentina and Chile
that is "really getting hot, competing with the Yukon for
the title of the fastest-warming place on the globe," in
the words of Eric Steig, a glaciologist who teaches at
the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent study published in Geophysical Research Letters, the
discharge rate of three important glaciers still remaining on the
peninsula accelerated eightfold just from 2000 to 2003. "Ice is
thinning at the rate of tens of meters per year"
on the peninsula, with glacier elevations in some places having
dropped by as much as 124 feet in six months,
it found.
</P>
<P>
But the narrow peninsula contains relatively little inland ice. Glaciologists are
more concerned that they are now beginning to detect similar
signs closer to the South Pole, on the main body
of the continent, where ice shelves are much larger --
and could contribute far more to sea level changes. Of
particular interest is this remote and almost inaccessible region known
as "the weak underbelly of West Antarctica," where some individual
ice shelves are as large as Texas or Spain and
much of the land on which they rest lies under
sea level.
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the most active part of Antarctica," said Eric
Rignot, a glaciologist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., and the principal author of the Geophysical Research Letters
paper. "Glaciers are changing rapidly and increasingly discharging into the
ocean, which contributes to sea level rise in a more
significant way than any other part of Antarctica."
</P>
<P>
According to another paper, published in the journal Science in September,
"the catchment regions of Amundsen Sea glaciers contain enough ice
to raise sea level by 1.3 meters," or about 4
feet. While the current sea level rise attributable to glacier
thinning here is a relatively modest 0.2 millimeters a year,
or about 10 percent of the total global increase, the
paper noted that near the coast the process had accelerated
and might continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the most recent flights by NASA and the
Chilean center have been directed over the Thurston Island and
Pine Island zones of West Antarctica, near where the Bellinghausen
and Amundsen seas come together. The idea is to use
the laser and radar readings being gathered to establish a
base line for comparison, with measurements to be taken every
two years or so.
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure yet how to connect what we see on
the peninsula with what we observe going on further south,
but both are very clearly dramatic and dynamic events," Bindschadler
said. "On the peninsula, large amounts of melt water are
directly connected to disintegration of the ice shelf, but the
actual mechanism in West Antarctica, whether melt water, a slippery
hill or a firmer bedrock, is not yet clear. Hence
the need for more data."
</P>
<P>
The information being gathered here coincides with the recent publication of
a report on accelerating climate change in the Arctic, an
area that has been far more scrutinized than Antarctica. That
study, commissioned by the United States and seven other nations,
found permafrost there to be thawing and glaciers and sea
ice to be retreating markedly, raising new concerns about global
warming and its impact.
</P>
<P>
"The Arctic has lots of land at high latitudes, and the
presence of land masses helps snow melt off more quickly,"
Steig said. "But there's not a lot of land to
speak of in the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere,"
making the search for an explanation of what is going
on here even more complicated.
</P>
<P>
The hypotheses scientists offer for the causes of glacier and ice
shelf thinning in Antarctica are varied. Rising air, land and
ocean temperatures or some combination have all been cited.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists have even proposed that a healing of the seasonal
ozone hole over the South Pole and southernmost Chile, a
phenomenon expected to take place in the next 50 years
or so, could change the circulation of the atmosphere over
the frozen continent in ways that could accelerate the thinning
of Antarctic ice fields. But even without that, the situation
developing in Antarctica is already sobering, glaciologists agree.
</P>
<P>
The data being collected in West Antarctica and on the peninsula
farther north make that obvious, they say, though the degree
to which that should be cause for concern around the
rest of the planet will become clear only with more
research.
</P>
<P>
"If Antarctica collapses, it will have a major effect on the
whole globe," Rignot cautioned.
</P>
<P>
"Nature is playing a little experiment with us," he said, "showing
us what could happen if the plug were to be
removed."

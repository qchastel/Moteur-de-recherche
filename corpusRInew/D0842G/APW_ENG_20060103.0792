Soviet-era pipeline grid means Russian gas exports must still move through Ukraine

Russia moves natural gas shipments through a grid of Soviet-era pipelines so
complex it is virtually impossible to guarantee the gas it pumps into Ukraine
comes out the other side and reaches European customers.
</P>
<P>
Several European countries reported shortfalls following the weekend cutoff of
direct exports to Ukraine amid a price dispute.
</P>
<P>
Moscow accused Ukraine of siphoning off some of the transit shipments. Kiev
denied the claims.
</P>
<P>
The fuel crisis highlights the challenges Moscow faces in moving energy supplies
across former Soviet territories it no longer controls.
</P>
<P>
Russia is the world's largest producer of natural gas, with many of its
customers in Europe. In total, Europe relies on Russia for about 25 percent of
its gas.
</P>
<P>
Though Russia has built other delivery systems and plans more, about 80 percent
of Russia's gas to Europe travels through Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of that rushes through a major pipeline that exits Ukraine at
Uzhgorod, and then flows to a transit station at Velke Kapusany, Slovakia, said
Sergei Kupriyanov, chief spokesman for the state-run Russian gas monopoly
Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
Kupriyanov said it was impossible for Gazprom to ensure that all the gas moving
through Ukraine reaches its final destination.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas is highly pressurized as it moves through a major pipeline, and to
stay that way it needs to be compressed periodically along the way. Compressors
are often gas-powered, meaning they use some of the gas in the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Kupriyanov said that compressing the 360 million cubic meters of gas it sent
into Ukraine for European customers on the first day of the year would use up
about 4 percent of the total _ far less than Gazprom claims Ukraine siphoned
off. He also said the company paid a fee for compression in advance.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom said Monday it was increasing the volume pumped into trans-Ukrainian
pipelines to compensate for the amount it claims Ukraine is stealing. European
countries reported their supplies were returning to normal.

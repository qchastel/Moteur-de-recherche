UKRAINE CONCEDES IT TOOK GAS FROM PIPELINE BUT SAYS IT HAD THE RIGHT

Ukraine conceded Tuesday that it had withdrawn natural
gas from its pipeline system that Russia said was intended
for export to Europe, but said it had a contractual
right to the fuel under an agreement with the Central
Asian nation of Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and Turkmenistan export natural gas through Russian pipelines to
Ukraine, which customarily takes some for its own use and
ships the rest on to other European countries. But Russia
cut the flow through the pipeline on Sunday, ostensibly in
a dispute with Ukraine over pricing and transit fees. That
set off alarm bells throughout Europe during the winter heating
season and shook world energy markets' confidence in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia placed blame for the shortages on Ukraine, saying it stole
gas intended for export, but under pressure from European governments,
Russia restored full flow to the pipeline on Monday. Despite
the bickering, the two countries resumed negotiations on gas prices
on Tuesday.

Nevertheless, the price of crude oil leapt by more than $2
a barrel on Tuesday in afternoon trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, fed by concerns over Russia's reliability. Crude
oil prices rose to a two-month, midday high of $63.80
a barrel before pulling back slightly.

While admitting that they took their usual allotment of gas on
Tuesday, Ukrainian officials dismissed Russian claims that the gas was
stolen. Mikola Goncharuk, a member of the board of Ukraine's
natural gas company, Naftogaz, said at a news conference in
Kiev that his company had indeed drawn down gas from
the pipeline system, but under a contract with Turkmenistan. Russian
export gas, he said, was untouched.

<P>
Gazprom, Russia's government-owned gas company, insists that the pipeline carries only
Russian gas for export to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the political fallout continued from Russia's brief gas embargo, which
was widely regarded in Europe as punishment of Ukraine for
its rejection of Moscow in elections last year and its
continued turn to the West and away from the Russian
orbit.

<P>
In Washington, the State Department spokesman criticized Russia's use of energy
as a foreign policy tool, while Austria and other Central
and Eastern European countries agreed to make the diversification of
energy supplies a priority, though they did not say how
they would achieve it.
</P>
<P>
The European Union's top energy official said Tuesday that the pricing
dispute could fester for weeks to come, jeopardizing one of
the Continent's primary sources of energy.

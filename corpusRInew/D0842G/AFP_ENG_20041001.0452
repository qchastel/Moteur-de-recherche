Demonstrators in the southwest of the Caucasus republic of Georgia
staged protests Friday against the building of an oil pipeline
through their district, a local television station reported.
</P>
<P>
Inhabitants of Akhaltsikhe blocked a dozen trucks carrying pipes
belonging the oil company British Petroleum (BP).
</P>
<P>
BP heads plans to build a pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan on the
Caspian Sea through the Georgian capital Tbilisi to Ceyhan in Turkey
on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The townspeople complain that convoys of trucks carrying material for
the project have wrecked roads in the area and are demanding
compensation, the Imedi television station said.
</P>
<P>
Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building
of the pipeline, local officials told AFP.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that their homes are in an area with a high
earthquake risk and call for the pipeline to be banned. They also
claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the
continual passage of the heavy trucks.
</P>
<P>
They are further demanding a promised payment of 110,000 lari (57,291
dollars, 46,187 euros) for the land needed for the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
BP has not so far reacted to the demands.
</P>

In August five Georgian police officers were injured during a protest
by   environmentalists opposed to the construction of the pipeline,
which is due to come into service next year.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline is to carry a million barrels of oil a day from the
Caspian to Turkey.

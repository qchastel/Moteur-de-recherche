Gazprom wins monopoly on gas exports from Central Asia: media

<P>
Russian gas giant Gazprom has reached a 
deal with Kazakhstan's government giving it a monopoly on gas 
exports from two of Central Asia's largest producers, Turkmenistan 
and Uzbekistan, Russian daily Kommersant reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
State-controlled Gazprom and a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's 
national oil and gas group, Kazmunaigaz, signed a series of 
agreements last week on Russian and Central Asian natural gas 
transports transiting Kazakhstan during 2006-2010, Gazprom said in a 
statement but provided no further details.
</P>
<P>
But according to Kommersant, which quoted a source close to the 
negotiations, the two parties agreed to set up "an export canal 
solely for the Kazakh-Russian company Kazrosgaz".
</P>
<P>
That would mean that "not a cubic meter of (Turkmen or Uzbek) 
would be sold beyond Kazakhstan without Gazprom's participation," 
the paper wrote.
</P>
<P>
The agreement does not cover Kazakh gas exports of between six 
and seven billion cubic meters, a Kazmounaigaz spokesman told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, a key transit country for Central Asian gas exported 
to Europe, can transport 50 billion cubic meters of natural gas per 
year.
</P>
<P>
The deal is expected to disappoint Ukraine, which had hoped to 
build a gas pipeline between Turkmenistan and Ukraine via Kazakhstan 
in a bid to decrease its energy dependancy on Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian state owns just over 50 percent of Gazprom. The 
company's key role in supplying and transiting energy to former 
Soviet states is often seen as a way for the Kremlin to exercise 
political pressure on its neighbours.

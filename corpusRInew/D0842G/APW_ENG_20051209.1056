<P>
Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder faced criticism Friday over plans to
take on a leading position at a consortium building a gas pipeline between
Russia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
As chancellor, Schroeder enjoyed a close personal and professional relationship
with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But now critics question the ethics of
him standing to gain personally from a major financial deal that he supported in
his role as chancellor.
</P>
<P>
"It stinks," said Reinhard Buetikofer, co-chairman of Germany's Greens, which
had been the junior party in a coalition with Schroeder's Social Democrats until
September. The Social Democrats continue to govern along with the conservative
Christian Democrats in a so-called grand coalition, while the Greens are in the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder is to become chairman of Gazprom's shareholder committee, a post
roughly comparable to board chairman, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller's spokesman
Sergei Kuprianov said in Russia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rainer Bruederle, a leading member of Germany's pro-business FDP party, said he
hopes Schroeder will only hold an honorary post, otherwise the suspicion would
arise that the former chancellor cannot distinguish between public and private
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, officials sealed the first link in the natural gas pipeline,
which will run along the Baltic seabed and bring the resources of Russia's gas
fields to the German market.
</P>
<P>
Russian gas giant OAO Gazprom, which will lead the consortium building the
pipeline, is the world's largest gas producer and supplies a quarter of Europe's
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The first section of the pipeline is scheduled to begin operation in
2010.

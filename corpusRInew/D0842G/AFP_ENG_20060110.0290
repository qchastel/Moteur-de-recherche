 Austrian energy giant OMV 
expects a decision to be reached on the construction of a gas 
pipeline between Iran and Europe by the end of 2007, the head of OMV 
Gas, Otto Musilek, said in a German radio interview broadcast on 
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Current developments will help us speed up the project," 
Musilek told Deutsche Welle radio, referring to the recent gas 
dispute between Russia and the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"The decision regarding the construction of the pipeline will be 
made by the end of 2007 at the latest."
</P>
<P>
In a project dubbed "Nabucco", OMV plans to build a 
3,300-kilometre gas pipeline from Iran to Austria via Turkey and the 
Balkan states.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the project is 4.6 billion euros (5.5 billion 
dollars) and the pipeline is to deliver up to 30 billion cubic 
metres of gas each year.
</P>
<P>
"For digging to begin, we need a transport volume of at least 
eight billion cubic metres each year. Negotiations with suppliers 
and distributors of natural gas are progressing well," Musilek 
said.
</P>
<P>
OMV did not regard the project as a rival to the planned 
German-Russian pipeline, he continued.
</P>
<P>
"According to forecasts, gas demand in Europe is going to grow 
enormously. Russia won't be able to meet all that demand on its own. 
"
</P>
<P>
Europe therefore needed access to Iran's gas reserves, which 
were the second biggest in the world.
</P>
<P>
"But we're also looking to Azerbaijan and other Arab countries," 
Musilek said.

Plans by Russia and Germany to build a 
north European gas pipeline flout the idea of Europe adopting a 
common policy towards Moscow, President Aleksander Kwasniewski of 
new EU member Poland said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"From the point of view of a common European policy towards 
Russia, it is unfortunate that one of the EU member states, an 
important country, Germany, should make its own policy decisions, 
going over the heads of Poland and the EU," Kwasniewski said on 
Radio Zet, a commercial station.
</P>
<P>
"This Russian-German project tends away from the concept of a 
common European policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Berlin and Moscow are expected to sign an agreement on the 
pipeline on Thursday when Russian President Vladimir Putin visits 
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The idea for a north European gas pipeline originated with 
Gazprom of Russia. The signature concerns about 1,200 kilometres 
(750 miles) of pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Vyborg in Russia 
to Greifswald in Germany, as part of a total network which is to 
extend for 3,000 kilometres.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline is intended as an alternative means of transporting 
natural gas than by-passing through Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom will build the pipeline with the German BASF company, 
and expects it to be operational in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Poland and the Baltic states are critical of the pipeline 
project, saying they fear it could see them cut off from supplies of 
Russian gas.

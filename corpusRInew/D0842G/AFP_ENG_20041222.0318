Talks between the state-controlled Russian gas group Gazprom and Gaz
de France (GDF) on a project to build a Baltic Sea pipeline are
making headway, GDF chairman Jean-Francois Cirelli said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's moving forward," he said after a meeting between Gazprom head
Alexei Miller and French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
</P>
<P>
"Decisions have not yet been taken in Russia but I think we took an
important step this morning.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has an interest in choosing good strategic partners who are
capable of bringing gas to Europe and I think Gaz de France is well
placed."
</P>
<P>
Cirelli said the scale of GDF's possible participation in the
project, expected to cost several billion dollars, had not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
The German group BASF, the world's largest chemical company, has also
expressed interest in a project that would enable Russia to supply
gas to Europe directly, bypassing Ukraine and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed (with Miller and Raffarin) the cooperation we currently
have with Gazprom, which should increase, and new areas of
cooperation, notably in gas transportation and in the liquified
natural gas sector," Cirelli said.

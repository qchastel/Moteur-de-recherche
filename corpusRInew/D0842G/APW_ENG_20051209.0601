Welders crouching on a snowy field sealed the first link Friday in a natural gas
pipeline that will stretch along the Baltic seabed, linking the resources of
Russia's gas fields with energy-hungry German consumers.
</P>
<P>
Politicians and dignitaries looked on in minus 15 C (5 F) temperatures as
construction began in the Vologda region, 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of
Moscow. Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov hailed the "major project of cooperation
between Russia and Europe."
</P>
<P>
"We are creating the conditions for stable cooperation in the energy sector,
ensuring energy security in Europe and the world," he was quoted as saying by
the Interfax agency.
</P>
<P>
Russian gas giant OAO Gazprom, which will lead the consortium building the
pipeline, is the world's largest gas producer and supplies a quarter of Europe's
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The first section of the pipeline is scheduled to begin operation in 2010,
ultimately pumping 55 billion cubic meters (72 billion cubic yards) of gas per
year from Vyborg, in northwest Russia, to Greifswald, in northern
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline is a "very important landmark in the development of the entire
economy of the European Union," Germany's Economics Minister Michael Glos was
quoted by Interfax as saying at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"This is a direct route that will link Russia and Germany, as well as consumers
in other countries in the future. It is ... of principal significance,"
Alexander Medvedev, deputy head of Gazprom's management board, said in televised
comments.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-kilometer (745-mile) pipeline bypasses existing transit routes through
Poland, Belarus and Ukraine, which Gazprom said in a statement was intended to
"exclude possible political risks." The project also has raised fears over its
environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
State-controlled Gazprom has partnered with German companies E.On AG and BASF AG
to build the section of the pipeline that passes under the Baltic Sea and has
said it will look for a third partner.
</P>
<P>
Under President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin has moved in the past year to regain
control over Russia's oil and gas sectors _ crucial geopolitical tools at a time
of tight supplies and high world prices.
</P>
<P>
Soaring oil prices have sent money flooding into the nation's coffers and fueled
an economic boom. Natural gas futures, too, hit a new intraday high in trading
Friday, reaching US$15.52 per 1,000 cubic feet during the Asian trading
session.
</P>
<P>
Chris Weafer, chief strategist with Alfa Bank in Moscow, said the groundbreaking
ceremony was "symbolic."
</P>
<P>
"It reinforces how important Gazprom is for Russia's economic and political
interaction with the western world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom will control 51 percent of the consortium company, called the North
European Gas Pipeline Co.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the company's shareholder committee _ roughly comparable to board
chairman _ will be former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, Gazprom CEO
Alexei Miller's spokesman Sergei Kuprianov said. Mathias Warnig, the former head
of Dresdner Bank AG's Moscow office and a longtime friend of President Vladimir
Putin, has been appointed its CEO.
</P>
<P>
Warnig and the Russian president met during Putin's posting with the KGB in
Communist East Germany.

DEEP IN THE SWAMP, AN 'EXTINCT' WOODPECKER LIVES

BRINKLEY, Ark.

The ivory-billed woodpecker, a magnificent bird long given
up for extinct, has been sighted in the cypress and
tupelo swamp of the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge here
in Arkansas, scientists announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bird experts, government agencies and conservation organizations involved kept the discovery
secret for more than a year, while they worked to
confirm the discovery and protect the bird's territory. Their announcement
on Thursday brought rejoicing among birdwatchers, for whom the ivory
bill has long been a holy grail -- a creature
that has been called the Lord God bird, apparently because
that is what people exclaimed when they saw it.
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, who
led the effort to confirm the sightings, said at a
news conference in Washington, "This is really the most spectacular
creature we could imagine rediscovering."
</P>
<P>
He was joined by Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, who announced
that the agency, along with the Department of Agriculture, had
proposed to spend $10 million in federal money for research,
habitat protection and law enforcement efforts to protect the bird.
The Nature Conservancy and other conservation groups have bought land
in the region of the refuge to help preserve a
larger area.

<P>
The bird was seen in thickly forested bottomland here, the deep,
wet woods immortalized by Faulkner. Today, researchers were traveling by
canoe down slow-flowing clay-colored bayous hoping for another sighting, and
working to finish up surveys of the territory.

<P>
With its 30-inch wingspan and formidable bill, sharp black and white
coloring, and the male's carmine crest, the ivory bill was
the largest of American woodpeckers, described by John James Audubon
as "this great chieftain of the Woodpecker tribe."
</P>
<P>
Once a dominant creature of great Southern hardwood forest, its numbers
dwindled as logging increased. The woodpecker inspired one of the
first conservation efforts in the nation's history, but its seeming
failure turned the ivory bill into a symbol of loss.
The last documented sighting was in Louisiana in 1944.
</P>
<P>
But the ivory bill lived on as a kind of ghost
in rumor and in numerous possible sightings. Despite lengthy expeditions,
no sighting was confirmed, until Feb. 11, 2004.

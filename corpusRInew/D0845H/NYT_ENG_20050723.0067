WOODPECKER FLIES BY AND THE CRITICS SOON FOLLOW

<P>
In the church of birds, where passions run
high and prophets emerge from swamps and thickets with revelations,
nothing can ruin a reputation like admitting that you have
seen an ivory-billed woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
Bobby Harrison, a large, gentle man with thinning hair and a
soft Alabama drawl, knows this and can recite the casualties.
Consider John V. Dennis, one of Harrison's heroes. He took
the last accepted photograph of an ivory bill in Cuba
in 1948. But when he testified to seeing one in
the Big Thicket area of southeast Texas in 1966, he
was ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
Harrison is willing to take the risk. He has had a
major part in the most recent report that the ivory
bill lives and now, after a period of acceptance and
celebration, some scientists and birders are questioning the strength of
the evidence, a videotape of a bird and eyewitness accounts.
What the critics want is an absolutely clear photograph and
a bird that can be seen repeatedly by a variety
of observers.
</P>
<P>
Three scientists have a paper in the works at the Public
Library of Science challenging the report in Science. No details
have been released, but there are other signs of doubt.
</P>
<P>
David Allen Sibley, perhaps the most prominent American birder, and the
author of highly popular field guides, said in an interview
on Thursday that he had concluded that in the Science
paper, "the evidence they've presented falls short of proof."
</P>
<P>
Sibley said he decided this independently of the three scientists who
wrote the rebuttal, although he had been in contact with
them.
</P>
<P>
Harrison said that he could not comment on an unpublished paper,
but that he was confident in the finding, and welcomed
a scientific discussion.
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner," Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
Even when it was common, the bird had a certain majesty
and mystery. For the last 50 years it has been
a symbol of loss, and of human failure. Most people
were afraid to hope.
</P>
<P>
Pete Dunne, vice president of the New Jersey Audubon Society and
a prolific author on birds, said he was one of
many who thought the ivory bill was gone for good.
</P>
<P>
"If someone had said to me, what was more likely, the
rediscovery of the ivory billed woodpecker or the Second Coming,
unhesitantly I would have gone to the latter."

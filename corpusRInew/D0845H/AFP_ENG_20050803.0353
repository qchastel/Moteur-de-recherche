"Rap tape" proves woodpecker back from the dead

<P>
For ornithologists, it was the 
equivalent of finding Elvis, alive and well, singing his heart out 
in some isolated, rural shack.
</P>
<P>
Long-feared extinct, the ivory-billed woodpecker is now back in 
the building -- or in its case, a boggy woodland in Arkansas -- its 
return confirmed by audio recordings of the bird's distinctive call 
and tree rap.
</P>
<P>
The saga of the ivory-bill's rediscovery in the United States -- 
the last confirmed sighting was more than 60 years ago -- is one of 
amateur sleuthing, professional rancour and sightings that reduced 
at least one hardened bird-watcher to a sobbing wreck.
</P>
<P>
Scientific consensus on the bird's re-appearance was finally 
reached this week when a prominent trio of sceptical academics 
withdrew their challenge to news of the discovery after listening to 
the sound recordings.
</P>
<P>
"It was extraordinary, chilling ... just stunning," said Richard 
Prum an ornithologist at Yale University who was one of the leading 
doubters.
</P>
<P>
"Listening to that tape would elicit goosebumps from anybody who 
cares about this bird," Prum told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The tape, which featured the sound of two ivory-bills, headed 
off what was threatening to turn into a fully-fledged academic 
bust-up in the ornothological community.
</P>
<P>
The woodpecker's return was first trumpeted by a group of 
scientists in a paper they submitted to the journal Science in May, 
based on a series of sightings and analysis of a blurry, four-second 
video.
</P>
<P>
Prum and two colleagues -- Mark Robbins, an ornithologist at 
Kansas University, and Jeremy Jackson, a zoologist at Florida Gulf 
Coast University -- found the evidence insufficient and submitted 
their own highly critical paper to that effect to the Public Library 
of Science.
</P>
<P>
"The reviewers complemented us on our tone. The other authors 
did not," Prum acknowledged. "I think they wish it had been done in 
a private way, but this was science and we wanted to take a formal 
route."
</P>
<P>
After listening to the audio recording, the dissenters withdrew 
their challenge.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't withdraw because we thought we'd made any mistakes, 
but because there was new evidence that made our script moot," Prum 
said.
</P>
<P>
The search for the ivory-bill began in earnest after a one-time 
shiitake mushroom farmer, Gene Sparling, spotted a woodpecker with 
the right markings while kayaking in February through a swamp in 
eastern Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot yet explain or fully comprehend why something so 
wonderful happened, certainly not why something so wonderful 
happened to me," Sparling, 49, told AFP in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Although confident of what he had seen, Sparling was, at first, 
wary of publicising his discovery.
</P>
<P>
"I knew if I went and told someone I'd be laughed at," he said. 
"Even for me it was difficult to believe that a species that had 
been extinct my entire life wasn't extinct at all."
</P>
<P>
In the end he made a veiled reference to the sighting on a 
website, which was brought to the attention of Tim Gallagher, editor 
of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Living Bird magazine, and Bobby 
Harrison, an associate professor at Oakwood College in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
After interviewing Sparling, Gallagher and Harrison visited the 
swamp where, on February 27, they both saw what appeared to be an 
ivory-bill in flight.
</P>
<P>
After independently sketching what they had seen, the two men 
compared notes and concluded the bird was indeed the legendary 
woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
"When we finished our notes," Gallagher wrote in an account of 
the sighting, "Bobby sat down on a log, put his face in his hands 
and began to sob, saying, 'I saw an ivory-bill. I saw an 
ivory-bill'."
</P>
<P>
Gallagher said he was too choked with emotion to speak. "Just to 
think this bird made it into the 21st century gives me chills. It's 
like a funeral shroud has been pulled back, giving us a glimpse of a 
living bird, rising Lazarus-like from the grave." 
</P>
<P>
The following month saw the formation of a full-scale search 
team, which documented further sightings and produced the brief 
video that formed the foundation of the Science article in May.
</P>
<P>
The rediscovery garnered national and international media 
attention, prompting concern that the woodpeckers habitat could be 
inundated with bird watchers.
</P>
<P>
"That's one of our biggest fears," said Morris, one of the 
converted dissenters.
</P>
<P>
"Could it become extinct because of people overrunning its 
place? We lost this bird once, we don't want to do it again," Morris 
said.

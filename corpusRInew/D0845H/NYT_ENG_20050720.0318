3 BIOLOGISTS QUESTION EVIDENCE IN SIGHTING OF RARE WOODPECKER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three biologists are questioning the evidence used by a team of
bird experts who made the electrifying claim in April that
they had sighted an ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird presumed to
have vanished from the United States more than 60 years
ago, in the swampy forests of southeast Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
If the challenge holds up, it would not only undermine a
scientific triumph -- the rediscovery of a resplendent bird that
had been exhaustively sought for years -- but also significant
new conservation expenditures in the region.
</P>
<P>
The paper questioning the discovery has been provisionally accepted by a
peer-reviewed scientific journal, which could post the analysis on its
Web site within a few weeks. But the paper will
be accompanied by a fierce rebuttal by the research team
that announced the bird's discovery defending their claim, and a
response to that rebuttal by the challengers.
</P>
<P>
The expected publication of the paper and the rebuttal was confirmed
in interviews and e-mail exchanges with two authors of the
challenge, Richard O. Prum and Mark B. Robbins, ornithologists at
Yale and the University of Kansas, as well as with
two members of the team that reported finding the woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
The third author of the new paper is Jerome A. Jackson,
a zoologist at Florida Gulf Coast University and the author
of the book "In Search of the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker," published
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The scientists on both sides of the issue declined to name
the journal or to discuss the details of the challenge
and the response until they are published.
</P>
<P>
But they made it clear that the debate revolves around four
seconds of fuzzy videotape that, by chance, captured a bird
with sweeping white-and-black wings as it darted from its perch
on the far side of a tupelo tree in April
2004 and flicked over swampy waters before vanishing in the
trees 11 wing beats later.
</P>
<P>
Everyone agrees that the bird that appears on the tape is
either an ivory-billed or a pileated woodpecker. The team that
conducted the original search for the bird ran extensive tests,
including recreating the scene captured in video using flapping, hand-held
models of the two types of woodpecker. They concluded that
the plumage patterns seen in the grainy image could only
be that of the ivory-billed woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the new paper disagree.
</P>
<P>
Only extended scientific discussion -- or new pictures of the bird
from additional searches -- will determine whose view will prevail.

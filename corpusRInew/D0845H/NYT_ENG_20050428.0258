BIRD THOUGHT TO BE EXTINCT DISCOVERED IN ARKANSAS SWAMP
</HEADLINE>

Twenty years ago, Chris Pague picked up a stuffed specimen of
an ivory-billed woodpecker and marveled at what had been lost.
</P>
<P>
So the news that the magnificent bird has been found in
an Arkansas swamp -- six decades after it was thought
to be extinct in the United States -- hit the
Nature Conservancy ecologist like a thunderclap.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of those pivotal moments in conservation," he said
Thursday at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. "
</P>
<P>
The rediscovery of a bird thought to have vanished due to
overlogging of its swamp habitat electrified scientists and birders, and
sharpened the long-standing debate over how best to conserve rare
and imperiled species.
</P>
<P>
The discovery conclusively demonstrates the importance of preserving "big, intact landscapes,"
Pague said.
</P>
<P>
"These hardwood swamps were protected for warblers and ducks -- not
ivory-bills," he said. "But it has the big old trees
the ivory-bill needs."
</P>
<P>
Rediscovery of the striking bird also will launch a storm of
research.
</P>
<P>
Rob Roy Ramey II, the Denver museum's zoology curator, intends to
start a DNA study from tissue in the feet of
the six ivory-bills in their collection within two weeks. The
DNA from those and other specimens might then be compared
with eggshells from wild birds to determine how much genetic
diversity has been lost.
</P>
<P>
The team of researchers that obtained conclusive video of an ivory-bill
made several more sightings and announced their findings Thursday in
the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials immediately moved to protect the woodpecker. Interior Secretary Gale
Norton announced $10 million in federal funding, to go with
$10 million already raised by private groups, to create a
conservation plan to help restore the ivory-bill.
</P>
<P>
North America's largest woodpecker, the bird was named for the long,
ivory-colored bill it uses to pry grubs from dying swamp
trees.
</P>
<P>
It is considered the Holy Grail for birders, who find its
striking plumage and imperial demeanor so magnificent that some dubbed
it "the Lord god bird" -- as in "Lord god,
what a bird."
</P>
<P>
Many conservation groups say the ivory-bill's persistence is proof that the
Endangered Species Act should be retained, including elements that require
protecting the kind of habitat critical for species recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Any reduction in protection is likely to spell doom of many,
many species that are not as special or showy as
ivory-bill, but have the same right to existence," said David
Ehrenfeld, a Rutgers professor and founder of Conservation Biology Magazine.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration said Thursday's news validates their conservation model. The
ivory-bill was found in an area where public and private
partnerships have helped create conditions for the bird to recover.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the time to take sides because the world
is changing and we have to conserve as much as
can as fast as can," said Scott Simon, executive director
of the Arkansas Nature Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
Some question whether the ivory-bill will benefit from all the attention.
</P>
<P>
"This is great for conservation," said Ehrenfeld. "It's probably not a
good thing for the bird. Too many people will look
for it."
</P>
<P>
But the most immediate and certain result of the ivory-bill's rediscovery,
observers agree, is a big dose of hope, optimism and
wonder.
</P>
<P>
"It's the Lazarus bird -- it was 'extinct' for generations and
now it's back," said birder and local author Mark Obmascik.
"There's something magical about having something like the ivory-bill living
on after all this time -- in spite of us."

WOODPECKER THOUGHT TO BE EXTINCT IS SIGHTED IN ARKANSAS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird long thought extinct, has been sighted
in the swamp forests of eastern Arkansas for the first
time in more than 60 years, Cornell University scientists said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bird, one of the largest species of woodpecker in the
world, disappeared after large-scale logging felled thousands of acres of
forest in the Southeast between the 1880s and 1940s. Scientists
said they could confirm the existence of at least one
male.
</P>
<P>
The last conclusive sighting of the woodpecker in North America occurred
in Cuba in 1944.
</P>
<P>
"It's a landmark rediscovery," said Scott Simon, director of the Nature
Conservancy's Arkansas chapter.
</P>
<P>
The sighting of the woodpecker, which has a distinctive white pattern
on its back and on the trailing edges of the
wings, was first reported in the journal Science on its
Web site Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The woodpecker has been spotted independently several times in the past
year and a half, including Feb. 27, 2004, when two
researchers in search of the bird set out on a
canoe in a bayou in Arkansas' Big Woods: 550,000 acres
of bottomland forest, bayous and oxbow lakes.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, Tim Gallagher, editor of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's
Living Bird magazine, and Bobby Harrison, a professor at Oakwood
College in Huntsville, Ala.,were paddling in a bayou when a
black-and-white bird flew about 70 feet in front of them.
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, they shouted, "Ivory bill!"
</P>
<P>
After the woodpecker flew back into the forest, the two each
sketched the bird from memory.
</P>
<P>
"When we finished our notes," Gallagher told Science. "Bobby sat down
on a log, put his face in his hands and
began to sob, saying: 'I saw an ivory bill. I
saw an ivory bill.' "
</P>
<P>
Gallagher told the journal that at the time he was too
overcome to speak. "Just to think this bird made it
into the 21st century gives me chills," he said. "It's
like a funeral shroud has been pulled back, giving us
a glimpse of a living bird, rising Lazarus-like from the
grave."
</P>
<P>
Two months later, a search team of field biologists headed by
Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology and the Nature Conservancy, spotted
the woodpecker and a researcher eventually captured on videotape four
seconds of an ivory-bill alighting from the trunk of a
tree. In all, there have been 15 sightings of the
bird since February 2004 during a period of more than
7,000 hours of searching.

RARE WOODPECKER ALIVE AND VOCAL IN ARKANSAS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The phoenix had nothing on the ivory-billed woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to keep track of how many times this
near-mythic bird, the largest American woodpecker and a poignant symbol
of extinction and disappearing forests, has been lost and then
found. Now it is found again.
</P>
<P>
Even the most skeptical ornithologists now agree. They say that newly
presented evidence shows that at least two of the birds
are living in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Richard O. Prum, an ornithologist at Yale University and one of
several scientists who had challenged the most recently claimed rediscovery
of the ivory bill, said Monday after listening to tape
recordings that he was now "strongly convinced that there is
at least a pair of ivory bills out there."
</P>
<P>
Mark B. Robbins, an ornithologist at the University of Kansas, who
had also been a skeptic, listened to the same recordings
with a graduate student and said, "We were absolutely stunned."
</P>
<P>
Robbins said the recordings, provided by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology,
were "astounding." Of a paper questioning claims of the woodpecker's
discovery that he, Prum and another scientist had submitted to
the Public Library of Science, he said, "It's all moot
at this point; the bird's here."
</P>
<P>
That was what the Cornell lab said last April, when it
announced that an ivory bill had been sighted in February
2004 in the Cache River Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas. Last
April, a group of scientists published a paper in the
journal Science on the rediscovery, with a heavily analyzed but
blurry video.
</P>
<P>
After widespread euphoria, three skeptics -- Prum, Robbins and Jerome A.
Jackson, a zoologist at Florida Gulf Coast University -- prepared
their criticism. Prominent birders like David Allen Sibley and Kenn
Kaufman, both authors of bird guides, agreed that the evidence
in the Science paper was not conclusive.
</P>
<P>
But while the skeptics' paper was still in preparation, the Cornell
team provided several audio recordings to Prum and Robbins. Jackson,
who was out of the country, had not had a
chance to listen to the recordings, Prum said.
</P>
<P>
The evidence -- the characteristic nasal "kent" call and double raps
on a tree -- was so convincing that Prum and
Robbins withdrew their challenge.
</P>
<P>
"The thrilling new sound recordings provide clear and convincing evidence that
the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct," Prum said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The snippet of videotape that until now was the strongest individual
piece of evidence showed only one bird. But the sound
recordings, made over many months in the White River National
Wildlife Refuge, just south of Cache River, provide vital signs
that a potential breeding population persists, said experts and officials
involved with the search.
</P>
<P>
"We felt all along that the White River was probably the
core of the bird's habitat and it was dispersing out,"
said Sam Hamilton, the southeastern regional director for the federal
Fish and Wildlife Service and the chairman of a panel
that is overseeing the drafting of the federal recovery plan
for the bird.
</P>
<P>
The scientific consensus on the strength of the sound recordings from
that region was "very, very exciting," Hamilton said. "It gives
you chill bumps to think about that vast bottomland hardwood
being certainly home to more than one bird."
</P>
<P>
Prum said the double raps appeared to be from a pair
of ivory bills communicating with each other, one close and
one far away. "I'm thinking about when I should head
down to Arkansas," he said.
</P>
<P>
John W. Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and
a primary author of the Science paper that announced the
bird's survival, said, "The birds are there, which we knew."
But Fitzpatrick said he was happy that a scientific battle
in print had been avoided.
</P>
<P>
"We sent them the sounds," he said. "I wish we'd done
that earlier." But he noted that the process was "science
in action, at its messy best."
</P>
<P>
The manager of the 160,000-acre White River refuge, Larry E. Mallard,
said the boggy woodlands there had been actively logged for
generations in a way that took care to protect areas
friendly to wildlife. As a result, Mallard said, one rare
species after another has returned, including bald eagles and swallow-tailed
kites.
</P>
<P>
The ivory bill topped it all, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now Elvis has come along," he said, "and said: 'I'm the
rock star. Look at me."'

The ivory-billed woodpecker, 
which was last seen in 1944 and feared extinct, has been seen in a
protected forest in Arkansas, scientists said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), long 
suspected to be extinct, has been rediscovered in the 'Big Woods' 
region of eastern Arkansas", researchers reported in the journal 
Science to be published.
</P>
<P>
The rediscovery "is thrilling beyond words", John W. 
Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, 
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The bird was spotted near where it was last seen. The first 
sighting of the spectacular bird is reported to be on Feb. 11, 
2004, and has been followed by several others, including one on 
April 25, 2004, in which the bird was videotaped.

<P>
The ivory-billed woodpecker is one of six North American bird 
species thought to have gone extinct since 1880. The black-and-
white bird, with a nearly one-meter wingspan and its distinctive 
ivory-colored bill, is larger than the more common pileated 
woodpecker that is similar in appearance.
</P>
<P>
The bird can live as long as 15 years.

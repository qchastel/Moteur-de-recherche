Scientists make public audio of ivory-billed woodpecker, bird long thought extinct

Scientists publicly presented recordings of the ivory-billed woodpecker, noting
that the tape suggests there might be more than one of the rare birds in an
eastern Arkansas swamp.
</P>
<P>
Some ornithologists had challenged the announcement of the bird's rediscovery,
made by a group of researchers in April. The ivory-billed woodpecker was thought
to be extinct until it was spotted in the swamps of southeast Arkansas last
year.
</P>
<P>
Skeptics said blurry videotape of a bird in flight wasn't enough evidence. But
many were won over after a team of Cornell University researchers sent doubters
several recordings of sounds that suggested the bird's existence.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday marked the first time the audio was publicly played during the
American Ornithologists' Union meeting in Santa Barbara.

"It is the best tangible evidence so far that there could be more than one
ivory-bill in the area," Russell Charif, a researcher at the Cornell Lab of
Ornithology, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said the sounds were similar to ivory bills. One recording featured a
series of distinctive nasally sounds that ivory bills make and another captured
an exchange of double-rap sounds, which may indicate two ivory bills
communicating with each other.
</P>
<P>
Since the woodpecker's rediscovery, federal agencies have promised millions to
help preserve the bird's eastern Arkansas habitat in and around the Cache River
National Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
John Fitzpatrick, lab director, said the ornithologists played their recordings
of the ivory bill woodpecker and then played recording of related species of
woodpeckers in South and Central America for comparison.
</P>
<P>
Reaction from conference attendees seemed positive, Fitzpatrick
said.

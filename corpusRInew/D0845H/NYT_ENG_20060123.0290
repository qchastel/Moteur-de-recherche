IVORY BILL REPORT IS CALLED 'FAITH-BASED ORNITHOLOGY'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the strongest published criticism yet of claims for the sighting
of the ivory-billed woodpecker in Arkansas in 2004, an ornithologist
who was not involved in the search has called claims
for proof of the bird's existence "faith-based ornithology."
</P>
<P>
The ivory bill was, or is, the largest North American woodpecker.
It inhabited Southeastern forests that have been heavily logged, and
the bird had been thought extinct, although occasional unconfirmed sightings
have occurred often since the last confirmed one in the
middle of the last century.
</P>
<P>
Then, in the spring of 2005, scientists announced that the bird
had been found in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge
in Arkansas, prompting a surge of elation among birders and
the general public, and later a steady current of questions
and skepticism.
</P>
<P>
Jerome A. Jackson, an ivory bill specialist at Florida Gulf Coast
University in Fort Myers, has now increased the intensity of
the discussion in a 15-page article in the current issue
of The Auk, a quarterly ornithology journal published by the
American Ornithologists' Union. In the article, Jackson writes of a
"rush to publication" of the article in Science, published online
in April 2005, that reported the 2004 sighting.
</P>
<P>
He also criticizes publicity about the sighting by conservation organizations and
the Interior Department as the "selling" of the ivory bill
and says the bird's existence has not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The strongest piece of evidence in the Science paper is a
brief, blurry videotape that Jackson says shows a pileated woodpecker,
not an ivory bill.
</P>
<P>
John W. Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in
Ithaca, N.Y., coordinator of the search and announcer of the
discovery of the ivory bill, said in an interview after
he had read Jackson's article that he stood by the
paper in Science.
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick said, "I have not yet seen any detailed scrutiny of
the video that disproves our case."
</P>
<P>
He said that what "hurts the most" is Jackson's accusation that
the Cornell Lab and other groups had been "selling" the
ivory bill to promote conservation and that this effort had
taken over the science. "We've tried very hard not to
oversell what we know," Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
The search is continuing at Cache River and the White River
National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick said the goal of the search, run by his lab,
was to find a roost hole or evidence of a
breeding pair. "We are still waiting for the prize," he
said. "We have had a handful of moments when observers
have seen what they are pretty sure is the bird.
We don't have the next big clue, which is a
roost hole."
</P>
<P>
Jackson said in an interview: "I am in no way saying
that ivory bills are not out there. I really hope
they are." But he added that he had not yet
seen convincing evidence.
</P>
<P>
Richard O. Prum, at Yale, another ornithologist who is not part
of the Cornell Lab effort, said he was watching the
search with great interest. Last summer, he, Jackson and Mark
B. Robbins of the University of Kansas wrote a critique
of the Science paper. They submitted it for publication and
then withdrew it as other evidence of the ivory bill
accumulated, although they remained critical of the evidence in Science.
</P>
<P>
"I think the ball is in their court," Prum said. "I
think they understand that to be universally accepted they're expected
to find solid evidence and repeatable evidence of the bird
this field season."

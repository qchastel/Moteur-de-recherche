Rebel leaders pulled out of peace talks on the crisis in the western
Sudanese region of Darfur on Monday accusing the government of
repeatedly breaching a ceasefire deal, spokesmen for their movements
said.
</P>
<P>
The Abuja conference's African Union mediators, however, expressed
the hope that the groups could be persuaded to change their minds and
said they would attempt to reconvene the talks on Tuesday at 10:00 am
(0900 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"We are suspending the talks until the situation improves," said
Ibrahim Bahar of the rebel Sudan Liberation Movement, accusing the
Khartoum government of ignoring a truce deal signed during a previous
round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The position of the two movements is the same. The situation on the
ground in Darfur is deteriorating," Mohammed Ahmed Tugod, chief
negotiator of the Justice and Equality Movement, told reporters as
the conference broke up.
</P>
<P>
"We have no alternative but to come to this conclusion... in order to
stop all the military activities going on in Darfur," he added.
</P>
<P>
The African Union's lead mediator, Sam Ibok, said that all the
international representatives at the talks had advised against the
walk-out because "there was no justification for such a suspension."
</P>
<P>
"The talks have not been suspended, we are reconvening at 10:00 am
tomorrow," he insisted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sudanese government spokesman Ibrahim Mohammed said: "Only
negotiation and talks will solve the problem of Darfur. Withdrawal
from the talks means more trouble for Darfur."

Peace talks aimed at ending a 22- month-old crisis in Sudan's
troubled Darfur region, scheduled for Friday in Nigerian capital
Abuja, has been postponed for a day, a spokesman for the African
Union said.
</P>
<P>
Assane Ba said the postponement followed "some logistic problems"
that led to the failure of the arrival of mediators and some rebels
in Darfur.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony is now scheduled to start at 4:00 p.m. ( 1500
GMT) on Saturday in Abuja, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and Darfur rebel groups, the Justice and
Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Movement, signed two
protocols on security and humanitarian aid in Abuja one month ago.
</P>
<P>
But this did not prevent the violence from deteriorating as the
United Nations and the African Union expressed serious concern.
</P>
<P>
Three days ago, UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs
Kieran Prendergast told the Security Council that Darfur was still in
chaos, plagued by banditry, rape and village burnings.
</P>
<P>
"Despite some earlier gains, November was characterized by violence
and a marked deterioration in the security situation," Prendergast
said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Alpha Oumar Konare, chairman of the African Union
Commission warned of continued military operations by both the rebels
and the Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
Calling the violations "serious and unacceptable," Konare urged them
to put an immediate end to all hostilities and demanded that they
abide by the agreement and protocols.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped all the sides in Abuja can reach a political solution
to end the conflict and to make it their responsibility to fully
honor their commitments.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations calls the conflict in Darfur the world's worst
humanitarian crisis, in which thousands were reportedly killed and
one million others displaced.
</P>
<P>
The crisis is indeed the African Union's first real test for its
commitment to security and peace, an issue that bugs the impoverished
continent for decades.

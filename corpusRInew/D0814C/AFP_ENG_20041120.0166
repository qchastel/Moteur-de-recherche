A deal to end the devastating conflict in Sudan's western region of

southern rebels are due to formally end a separate 21-year conflict,
the chairman of the African Union said Saturday.

AU chief and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo told a news
conference in Dar es Salaam that the AU's intention was "to move on

It is not impossible."

On Friday, Khartoum and the southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Movement/Army promised the UN Security Council in Nairobi that they

accord to end a war that began in 1983 and has claimed some 1.5
million lives.

Separate negotiations between Khartoum and two rebel groups from
Darfur, who rose up against the government in February 2003, are to
resume on December 10.

The European Union is ready to finance an African peacekeeping force
in the troubled Sudanese region of Darfur to the tune of 100 million
euros (126 million dollars), an official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to finance this operation... and 100 million euros could
be released," an EU diplomat said, underlining that "the EU's
substantial contribution is in the process of being approved".
</P>
<P>
EU foreign affairs chief Javier Solana was due in the region Friday
to discuss the crisis in Darfur, the scene of a bloody offensive
against rebels by militias backed by the Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council has threatened sanctions on
Sudan's vital oil industry if Khartoum fails to rein in the militias.
</P>
<P>
Solana was heading Friday to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa for
talks with officials at the African Union, which is trying to revive
stalled peace talks in Nigeria between the Darfur rebels and the
Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
The AU said Thursday it was going to boost the size of its ceasefire
monitoring and civilian protection force in Darfur from 465 to 3,320
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Solana was then to travel to Khartoum for weekend talks on Darfur
with Sudanese President Omar el-Beshir.
</P>
<P>
The EU official said before leaving Brussels that the bigger
monitoring mission, coupled with the peace talks, represented "a
window of opportunity" for Sudan, the AU and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
"This opportunity must not be missed. The EU will continue
contributing to the monitoring mission with financial, technical,
expertise and personnel," Solana said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The UN estimates that around 70,000 people have been killed and 1.5
million displaced in 20 months of war in Darfur.
</P>
<P>
The EU has already released 12 million euros to support the AU's
ceasefire monitoring mission and has sent a team of military experts
to support its work out of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
In Ethiopia, Solana was also to meet John Garang, the leader of the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, which is in the final stages of
negotiations to end a 21-year war with the Khartoum government.

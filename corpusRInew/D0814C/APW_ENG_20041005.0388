Libya

<P>
Sudan's government said Tuesday that it will accept an invitation to
a "mini summit" this month convened by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
on the crisis in Sudan's western Darfur region.
</P>
<P>
Libyan Foreign Minister Abdel-Rahman Shalqam said Gadhafi wants the
Oct. 21 summit in the Libyan city of Sirte to deal with both the
humanitarian and political aspects of the crisis in Darfur, where
fighting has killed 50,000 people and driven another 1.4 million from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir, Shalqam said
Gadhafi also invited leaders of Darfur's two rebel groups and the
presidents of Egypt, Chad and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Majzoub Khalifa, the head of the Sudanese government delegation to
the peace talks with Darfur rebels, said in a statement that Sudan
would attend the meeting, but did not say whether el-Bashir himself
would lead the delegation.
</P>
<P>
"The president has welcomed the holding of this summit, and a
presidential delegation will be there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa said the government was sending the delegation "in support of
the African Union and also to keep this issue within the African and
Sudanese context, without any foreign intervention."

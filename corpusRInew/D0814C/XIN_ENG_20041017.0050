A senior Egyptian diplomat said Sunday that a five-way summit to be
held here later in the day eyes finding humanitarian and political
solutions to the Darfur crisis within the framework of the African
Union (AU).
</P>
<P>
"The summit will try to find an appropriate way within the AU
framework that can be accepted by Sudan's two conflicting sides of
their accord, not against their will," the diplomat in the Egyptian
delegation told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"How to strengthen the AU framework is one of the major topics of the
summit," he said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Libya, Sudan, Egypt, Nigeria and Chad are to
convene on the Darfur issue in preparations for the summit slated for
late Sunday, which grouped leaders from the five countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the summit is called at an important timing when
conflicting views emerged at both regional and international levels
toward how to solve the Darfur crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has a clear attitude toward the humanitarian aspect in the
Darfur issue, that is to say, we have to allow Sudan all
opportunities to solve the crisis," the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
As a neighboring country of Sudan, Egypt would try its best to offer
help, the diplomat said, adding Egypt would like to call for a
similar summit in the near future if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Queried about the role of Arab countries in this regard, the diplomat
said Egypt welcomes any effort made by Arab countries if it would
benefit Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Clashes flared up in February 2003 between marauding militia, known
as Janjaweed, and local black Africans over scarce resources in the
barren western Sudanese region of Darfur.
</P>
<P>
Two rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and
Equality Movement (JEM), took up arms to fight the Janjaweed, which
was believed to be responsible for killings and lootings.
</P>
<P>
They also accused the government of years of negligence and unfair
allocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the Sudanese government and the rebel groups have
adjourned in the Nigerian capital of Abuja without major breakthrough
and would be resumed after the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian diplomat said the summit in Libya would focus on finding
ways to revive the stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"During the summit, all concerned Sudanese parties are expected to
pledge sincere and practical efforts to settle the disputes," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The summit was called under the AU auspices in a bid to solve the
Darfur crisis, which has grabbed unprecedented world attention.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council adopted a resolution on Sept. 18, urging the
Sudanese government to stabilize the situation in Darfur and fully
cooperate with the AU.
</P>
<P>
The AU has spearheaded international attempts to resolve the crisis
and is in the process of deploying a 4,500-strong force from around
five African countries to Sudan to oversee the peace process.

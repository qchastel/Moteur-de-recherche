<P>
Libya and the African Union Tuesday invited Sudanese President Omar
al-Beshir to a mini-summit in Libya on the Darfur crisis, due to be
attended by Sudan's neighbors Chad and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
This came during a meeting between Beshir and Libyan leader Moamer
Khadafi's special envoy, Said Arabi Hefiana, and Nigeria's junior
foreign minister, Aboubakar Tanko, who is also assistant secretary
general of the AU.
</P>
<P>
Hefiana and Tanko delivered the invitation in letters from Khadafi
and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, the current chairman of the
AU, which is sponsoring peace talks between Khartoum and Darfur
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The official Al-Anbaa daily on Tuesday quoted Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail as saying the letters also dealt with the
situation in Darfur and efforts by the AU to resolve the 20-month
conflict there.
</P>
<P>
Hefiana and Tanko flew to Khartoum from Egypt where they delivered a
message to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, also inviting him to the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Egyptian presidential spokesman Maged Abdel
Fattah told reporters consultations were underway to determine the
exact date of the summit, which was to take place "before October
21".
</P>
<P>
The summit was part of ongoing AU efforts to "contain the situation
in Darfur", where conflict has left some 50,000 people dead,
displaced an estimated 1.4 million and forced nearly 200,000 to flee
into neighboring Chad.
</P>
<P>
It also aimed to "fend off the consequences of United Nations
Security Council resolutions and consolidate the role of the AU in
dealing with the conflict," Abdel Fattah said.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council passed a resolution in September threatening
sanctions against Sudan's vital oil industry for the government's
failure to rein in pro-government Arab militias accused of atrocities
in Darfur.
</P>
<P>
The visits of the Libyan and AU envoys coincided with a meeting in
Ndjamena, Chad, of the AU's ceasefire committee and representatives
from the Sudanese government and the two main rebel groups in Darfur.
</P>
<P>
Ismail told A-Anbaa participants would also discuss the situation in
Darfur and ceasefire violations by Sudan and the Darfur rebels.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his government's acceptance of the Security Council
resolution on Darfur calling for an increased number of AU troops in
Darfur and broadening their mandate, saying this would help in the
process of confidence-building, particularly between the police and
displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
Sudan recently agreed that the AU could deploy its troops in camps
for displaced persons in Darfur to monitor the activities of the
police.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said the move would reassure the displaced, many of who accuse
the police of complicity in attacks against them by Arab militias and
encourage them to move freely in and out of the camps.
</P>
<P>
The news comes as British Prime Minister Tony Blair prepared to pay a
brief visit to Sudan Wednesday for talks with Sudanese leaders on
several issues, including the Darfur crisis.

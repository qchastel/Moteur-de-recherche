Animal lovers across the country are mobilizing to
help thousands of pets and farm animals still stranded or left
homeless by Hurricane Katrina and the floods that followed.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Pacelle, president and chief executive of the Humane Society
of the United States, appealed Wednesday for immediate federal, state
and local assistance in the Gulf Coast area to save animals he said
will die in the next few days if they aren't found, fed and sheltered.

``Animals are trapped by the thousands in their homes, and the
clock is ticking,'' he said. ``We need the government to help us, not
with money but with rescuers. We need the Coast Guard, firemen and the
National Guard. ... We'll take care of the animals after they are
pulled out.''
</P>
<P>
Pacelle, noting that about 60 percent of households have pets,
estimated that more than 50,000 animals might be in peril. His
organization has received more than 2,000 calls from people who fled
Katrina. Other organizations, including the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, also have been getting pleas for
help. Many people left behind pets, especially cats, because they
thought they would be gone only a couple of days.

Hundreds of animal welfare workers and volunteers are in Louisiana
and Mississippi with mobile veterinary units, vans, boats, pet food
and supplies, as well as holding pens for farm animals. The most
crucial mission is the door-to-door rescue of the stranded pets, but
officials said there also is a pressing need to ease the strain on
crowded animal shelters and get pet food to those who have taken in
stray animals until they can be reunited with their owners.
</P>
<P>
Several animal welfare groups are using their Web sites to help
reunite owners with their pets -- and to solicit contributions to
assist with their rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
Many people who were trapped in their homes by Katrina said they
chose to stay rather than leave without beloved pets. Animal rescue
workers said Wednesday that they are trying to find more shelters that
will allow the people and pets to remain together.
</P>
<P>
``Some of these people will live on the streets and won't go to a
shelter if they have to be separated from their pets,'' said Laura
Bevan, the Humane Society's southeast regional director. ``I respect
that, because I wouldn't either.''

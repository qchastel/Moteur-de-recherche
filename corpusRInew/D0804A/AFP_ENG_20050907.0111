NEW ORLEANS, Sep 7
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four kittens floating on a broken 
door. A German Shepard loose on the interstate. And a 90 kilo 
(200-pound) potbellied pig tied to a fence. 
</P>
<P>
Those were just a few of the animals that Willie Cirone and his 
partner Jeff Eyre rescued from the devastation wrought by Hurricane 
Katrina. 
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society volunteers sped though New Orleans answering 
calls from evacuees who left their pets behind, and rescue workers 
who found them in the floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was surrounded when it pulled onto a street filled 
with rescue workers searching flooded houses for survivors.
</P>
<P>
"I got four kittens I rescued today," one firefighter called out 
as he dashed past the boats to a dry spot where he'd left the 
mewling grey kittens.
</P>
<P>
Three others brought dogs over, including Tim Robson, who'd 
spotted a beagle in a window and smashed it open to get the dog 
out.
</P>
<P>
"How can people leave them," wondered Robson, a firefighter from 
New Mexico who owns a dog and a goldfish. "I'd much rather see a 
person in a house than an animal because an animal can't do anything 
for itself."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were forced to leave their pets behind when 
they evacuated New Orleans. Most expected to be home in a few days. 
But with nearly 80 percent of the city buried under disease-ridden 
floodwaters, officials said they won't be able to get back to their 
homes for months. Even to get their pets.
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society and SPCA are doing their best to rescue 
animals trapped in sweltering homes for more than a week. Getting 
them all will be impossible.
</P>
<P>
"You can only take as many dogs as you have people to take care 
of them," Cirone said. "It's a massive operation."
</P>
<P>
Cirone and Eyre spent nearly two hours Tuesday clearing a house 
filled with 22 cats, two dogs and a bird. Healthy animals roaming 
the street are left to fend for themselves so the animal protection 
crews can focus on saving those trapped in homes with no way to 
scavenge for food. 
</P>
<P>
It's exhausting work. But the worst part isn't the animals. It's 
the people.
</P>
<P>
"You've got to walk through bodies to get animals," Cirone said. 
"Some were in the water. Some were on their porch."
</P>
<P>
The burly firefighter and animal control officer from New Jersey 
said he tries his best to tune out the misery around him and to 
focus on getting his job done. But there are moments when it slips 
through. 
</P>
<P>
Like when a small boy and his mother dropped off their pet 
rabbit and mice. 
</P>
<P>
"All their possessions were in a Volkswagen Beatle. That's all 
they have left."
</P>
<P>
The animals are being cared for at a farm north of Louisiana 
until they can be reunited with their families, many of whom were 
told they would not be able to bring their pets on evacuation busses 
and helicopters. Photographs of some animals are being posted on a 
website, petfinder.com, so their owners can claim them.

SPCA WORKS TO REUNITE HURRICANE-STRANDED PETS WITH OWNERS

</DATELINE>

<P>
Molly was stranded in the floodwaters that submerged
New Orleans East. So was her blind owner. But when
rescue workers airlifted the owner last week, Molly, a black
Labrador seeing-eye dog, was left behind.
</P>
<P>
Five days passed, said Laura Maloney, director of the Louisiana Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, before the New
Orleans police, National Guard soldiers and a man named Joe
with a boat found their way to the house. An
animal-control officer in waders stepped into water that still rose
halfway up the first floor, and she climbed the stairs.
</P>
<P>
"She saw a black nose peeking around the corner," said Maloneywhose
office also handles animal control for the city. "It was
the petrified dog. She was very thin."
</P>
<P>
Within 24 hours dog and owner were reunited in Lake Charles,
La. But Maloney say endings as happy as this have
been frustratingly rare so far. Out of at least 3,000
cats and dogs and several hundred birds, reptiles and other
exotic pets recovered so far, only 300 to 400 have
been reunited with their owners since the storm, she said.
</P>
<P>
The society is beginning to post photographs of the animals on
a Web site, petfinder.com, which has created a section about
animals in Hurricane Katrina.
</P>
<P>
The society is keeping an average of about 2,000 animals at
the Lamar-Dixon Center in Gonzalez, La., flying or driving about
500 to Houston and other places every other day. Maloney
said the center received at least 700 animals on Monday
alone.
</P>
<P>
The center is also housing about 400 horses, as well as
animals that until two weeks ago worked pulling tourists through
town.
</P>
<P>
"The French Quarter mules are at our facility," Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
She noted the large feral cat population in New Orleans. Rail-thin
kittens lurk in yards in muddy neighborhoods by day and
dart away when car headlights disrupt the darkness over the
city at night.
</P>
<P>
Maloney estimated that tens of thousands of animals remained in the
city and said that her group was conducting "food missions"
on Tuesday, leaving food at various points for animals they
cannot yet rescue.
</P>
<P>
The society has been frustrated by outside groups, however well-intentioned, that
have come to the region, sometimes taking animals back to
shelters in other places without registering their work with the
society.
</P>
<P>
Maloney said those rescues left "no opportunity to reunite owners with
pets."
</P>
<P>
She emphasized that many outside groups were using the society's registration
system, including the Humane Society of the United States and
a large group from Broward County, Fla., which is running
the shelter operations at Lamar-Dixon.
</P>
<P>
Maloney attends daily emergency management briefings with military, police and city
officials, always carrying a laminated map, made by Louisiana State
University using global-positioning satellite software, that pinpoints addresses where owners
have said their pets may be.

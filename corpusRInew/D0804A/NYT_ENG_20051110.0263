The images left an indelible mark on the American
conscience: man's best friend wandering the abandoned streets of New
Orleans or stranded atop the city's flooded houses.
</P>
<P>
But the plight of pets in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina
did more than just soften the hearts of the nation's
animal lovers -- it opened their wallets.
</P>
<P>
Tens of millions of dollars -- an unprecedented amount compared with
other disasters, animal welfare advocates say -- poured into pet
charities such as the Humane Society, the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, PetSmart Charities and Noah's Wish,
a group whose sole purpose is to save animals during
disasters.
</P>
<P>
"The images were compelling," said Wayne Pacelle, president and chief executive
officer for the Humane Society of the United States. "It
was gut-wrenching for people to see pets being taken away
from their owners as they were being evacuated."
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of post-hurricane recovery and relief funds went to
help people, said Katya Andresen, vice president of marketing for
Network For Good, the nation's largest clearinghouse for online charitable
giving. She noted that $1.3 billion of the $2 billion
raised so far for Katrina relief went to the Red
Cross, primarily through the Red Cross Web site, phone lines
and direct mail campaign.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Red Cross was the top recipient of Katrina relief donations
through Network For Good, with $7.5 million. But four others
in the top 10 specialize in animal assistance.
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that got a lot of (media) coverage
was people having to leave their pets behind," Andresen said.
"People really connected with that part of the story and
those images."
</P>
<P>
In contrast, she said, "The last big disaster was tsunami, and
pets were not part of that story." Donations reflected that.
</P>
<P>
Among the animal-welfare organizations that took in the most post-hurricane money
were the Humane Society, with $20 million in donations; Noah's
Wish, with $6.5 million; and PetSmart Charities, with $3.5 million.
Much of the money has paid or will pay for
food, medical attention and vaccines, sheltering pets and reuniting them
with owners, and rebuilding damaged animal shelters in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
"People to a great extent can take care of themselves. They
can ask for help or use their cell phones, and
animals cannot do that," said Terri Crisp, founder and director
of Noah's Wish. "People's hearts go out to them more
because they are helpless."
</P>
<P>
At the Web site www.networkforgood.org, donors can search for nonprofit groups
by the type of charitable work they do, then make
contributions online. Donors for Katrina relief gave to more than
300 organizations through Network For Good, Andresen said. On that
list, the Humane Society (with $309,000 in gifts) ranked behind
Red Cross, Salvation Army and Catholic Charities USA, but ahead
of Habitat for Humanity (with $264,000 in gifts).
</P>
<P>
Animal advocacy groups said the level of giving to pet charities
does not mean the donors value pets above people. Rather,
they said, this disaster showed the close relationship between humans
and animals.
</P>
<P>
"People who gave felt the animals were related to people and
wanted them to be OK," said Linda Lampkin, director for
the Urban Institute's National Center for Charitable Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Pacelle, of the Humane Society, said having to choose between humans
and pets is "a false choice. A lot of people
gave to both."
</P>
<P>
"There's a misconception that there's a finite amount of compassion," Pacelle
said. "People donated toward the human and animal victim."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Andresen said Network For Good reported many people giving to
more than one organization -- one that would help people
and another that would help people's furry friends.
</P>
<P>
"Noah's Wish exists as much to help people as animals," added
Crisp, explaining that the group has sheltered families, taken care
of their pets free of charge and reunited pets with
families.
</P>
<P>
"We're not taking away from anything by being here to take
care of the animal needs. If we weren't here, there
would be a large percentage of animals that wouldn't have
survived (the hurricane and its ensuing flood), and that would've
been a huge loss for people."
</P>
<P>
Aside from donations, animal-advocacy groups said the dramatic post-disaster period opened
up a window for them to educate the public about
the importance of having a disaster plan for pets.
</P>
<P>
Said Pacelle, "People will never see animals in disaster in the
same way."

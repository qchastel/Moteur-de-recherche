If Hurricane Katrina causes Congress to create a government
safety net for the nation's pets, Rep. Jim Oberstar says
it won't be the first time that a higher power
intervened on behalf of animals.
</P>
<P>
"God told Noah to make an ark and move the animals
aboard," he said. "There's at least a biblical antecedent for
this."
</P>
<P>
Oberstar, D-Minn., is co-sponsoring a bipartisan bill that would force states
and local governments to come up with emergency evacuation plans
for pets. Failure to do so would make them ineligible
for disaster grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
Oberstar, who has a year-old chow/lab mix dog named Roux, said
his heart went out to the shivering and bewildered pets
that were stranded in the floodwaters in New Orleans. And
he's none too pleased that some rescue workers didn't allow
people to take their companions with them when they fled.
</P>
<P>
"They were told, 'You come, leave your pet,"' said Oberstar.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the proposal for pet evacuation goes too far.
</P>
<P>
"People come before pets," said Chuck Morse, a Massachusetts Republican who's
running for the House seat now held by Democratic Rep.
Barney Frank, another co-sponsor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
Morse called the proposal ill-timed as recovery operations continue on the
Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
"We've got over a thousand people dead. I don't think that's
the time to offer legislation that forces FEMA to insist
upon extra regulations before it issues funding to help people,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society of the United States says there are more
than 358 million pets in the nation, residing in 63
percent of U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the chief sponsor of the bill, said
that Hurricane Katrina brought "unbelievable images into American homes every
night," and that it was "just heartbreaking" to watch evacuees
choose between being rescued or leaving their pets behind.
</P>
<P>
"Katrina taught us the hard lesson that as we prepare for
future emergencies, it's important we include in our plans ways
to protect our pet owners and their pets," said Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn., co-chairman of the Congressional Friends of Animals
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
Lantos and Shays wrote a letter to Michael Chertoff, secretary of
the Homeland Security Department, asking whether the federal government has
any plan to save the thousands of pets that are
threatened when natural disasters occur.
</P>
<P>
"If indeed there is a plan to protect pets, it appears
to have been an abject failure," they wrote.
</P>
<P>
Oberstar said he believes the legislation, called the Pets Evacuation and
Transportation Standards (PETS) Act, has "great appeal." It has two
Republican co-sponsors: Shays and Don Young of Alaska. Oberstar, who
was touring the Gulf Coast to assess the damage on
Tuesday, said he hopes to get the legislation attached to
his bill that would make FEMA an independent agency and
give it Cabinet-level status.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a matter of creating a hierarchy of values
that you put pets at the top, but you put
pets somewhere," Oberstar said. He said there's also a health
issue, because many abandoned pets die and their remains decay.
"We've made them dependent on us, and we have an
obligation to them."

FLOODED STREET BECOMES WATERWAY TO SEEKING LOST PETS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Orleans -- A thoroughfare in New Orleans that ends where
the water begins has become a launching point for rescue
workers and for residents looking for anything left behind --
especially pets.
</P>
<P>
After Hurricane Katrina's devastation hit, residents walked along Veterans Memorial Boulevard
into New Orleans from neighboring Jefferson Parish only to be
stopped by flood waters lapping the street where it dips
lower. Homes on both sides of the ramp and as
far as residents could see were flooded up to the
eaves last week.
</P>
<P>
Almost all other access points into New Orleans have been blocked
by military soldiers or are being used as launching points
for official search and rescue crews.
</P>
<P>
Search crews and ambulances gathered at Veterans Memorial Boulevard to save
anyone still stuck in the flooded city. But some residents
brought hopes of finding pets, while others wanted to reclaim
anything that would allow them to move forward with their
lives.
</P>
<P>
Others just stood there and cried.
</P>
<P>
"My son's house, my mother's house, our first house are all
in there," said one sobbing woman who wanted to remain
anonymous. "Anything but this water we could deal with. This
water is unforgivable. The lives this is going to ruin
... "
</P>
<P>
The street was littered with water bottles, old clothing and other
trash washed up by the water, which has receded in
recent days. A toy shark lay in the median in
grass that became mud closer to the water.
</P>
<P>
Most were disappointed by what they found or could not even
get to their homes. Others were luckier, able to retrieve
clothing, and one woman walked away with her two rescued
cats.
</P>
<P>
Throughout last week, trucks backed down the boulevard, dropping motorboats, paddleboats
and even jet skis into the water. Those without boats
asked for rides, trading gallons of gas or cash for
rides to their homes.
</P>
<P>
Others just "borrowed" boats left behind.
</P>
<P>
After asking a few people for rides, Robert Krowl took the
motor off a boat and paddled to his home. He
was desperate to get to Snoopy, his 4-year-old Dachshund, and
Boots, a 12-year-old cat.
</P>
<P>
"I would gladly give money to anyone to help get my
pets," he said. "I put food for them on the
bottom floor. I didn't think the water would get that
high. I thought we'd be back in five or six
days."
</P>
<P>
More than an hour later, Krowl returned to the landing without
his beloved dog and cat. He was near tears.
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't get close enough," he said. Downed power lines
and trees blocked passage to the house.
</P>
<P>
As he left, others were getting into the water. They sought
remnants of anything that could help them get on with
their lives.
</P>
<P>
For Matt Kerrigan and Todd Musgrave, that meant going in for
their suits so they could begin to work again.
</P>
<P>
After climbing into a second-story window, Musgrave also retrieved birth certificates
and other clothing from his Lakeview home, then still submerged
in 4 feet of water. A large wooden swing set
in his backyard was turned upside down on the house.
</P>
<P>
Richard LeBanc and Mike Goodrich brought many of the stranded to
safety at the landing during the first several days after
the storm. The pair did not evacuate, living in the
top floor of a neighbor's house since Katrina hit.
</P>
<P>
But over the weekend the pair decided to give it up
and join those living on dry land.
</P>
<P>
"We're sick, it's time to go," LeBanc said. "We can't go
back out, it smells like sewage. We are both getting
sick."
</P>
<P>
While the odds were often against those who got on boats
looking for lost animals, they came anyway.
</P>
<P>
The risk paid off for one woman.
</P>
<P>
Ellen White broke out in tears when her friend Bob Lewis
returned to the landing in a boat, her two cats
cradled in his arms wrapped in towels.
</P>
<P>
Domino and Destiny were found on furniture, Domino on a floating
bookshelf in the living room looking out the window and
Destiny in the bedroom on a floating mattress. The house
still had 5 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
"I had them on Science Diet Light because they were getting
fat, but I guess it was a good thing they
were fat," she said through her tears. "This was the
only reason to come back."

They limped into Los Angeles on Friday --
animal saviors from Hurricane Katrina beset by a journey of
flat tires and big-rig pile-ups. And dozens of half-starved dogs
and cats.
</P>
<P>
The caravan of barking dogs was met by a Hollywood reception
of B-actresses and animal doters on hand to give them
L.A. hugs and foster care.
</P>
<P>
"Poochy poochy poochy pooh," cooed Deborah Bass of Simi Valley, wagging
the paws of Stormy, a black cockapoo rescued this week
from New Orleans' 9th Ward. "We are incredibly blessed to
be able to help."
</P>
<P>
Bass, co-founder of Bichons and Buddies animal rescue, had joined Rescue
for Ruffugees II -- 10 rescue groups and more than
60 mostly women volunteers to triage, treat and take in
35 four-legged foster pets. Each will be kept a month
before being put up for adoption to allow for a
possible reunion with its owners, who are being sought via
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
As a New Leash on Life Emergency Rescue Team unloaded its
cargo at a Van Nuys Airport hangar, the reception committee
turned to mush at the site of 30 suffering pooches
and five skinny kitties.
</P>
<P>
"This is very hard," said Danielle Nicolet of Studio City, an
actress who lives in New Orleans part of the year.
"A lot of my friends lost their dogs ... I'm
here to help the doggies."
</P>
<P>
The animals followed the 232 dogs and 13 cats now in
Los Angeles foster homes or shelters as a result of
Hurricane Katrina. The event, hosted by the New Leash on
Life of Santa Clarita and Much Love Animal Rescue, could
well be the last.
</P>
<P>
There were thin German shepherds. Frowzy-haired terriers. Beagles with sores. Pomeranians
with mouth tumors. And limping mutts that had nails pulled
from their paws.
</P>
<P>
There were also prancing chows. Sprightly pit bulls. And springer spaniels
willing to lick the faces of strangers.
</P>
<P>
Like other Katrina rescues, more than half of the dogs and
cats were believed to have contracted heartworm and other parasites.
They had endured toxic floods and had little to eat
but garbage and carrion.
</P>
<P>
"We found them in houses, in closets, locked in bathrooms, under
beds. A lot of them running in packs on the
streets we couldn't catch," said Jane Rosner, 49, of Calabasas,
one of 22 volunteers to join Bobby Dorafshar and his
New Leash rescue team in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
"Some came in happy, wagging their tails -- 'Oh, my God,
I'm so happy to be here,"' said Karen Betzold, 39,
of Glendale, another rescue team volunteer.
</P>
<P>
"Some came in sad -- 'I just want to go back
in my cage.' Some came in aggressive -- 'Get the
hell away from me, I've had enough. I'm hungry. I'm
scared."'
</P>
<P>
En route to Los Angeles, a caravan of five trucks and
vans suffered one accident with a semi, two flat tires,
one dead battery, and one air conditioner failure for the
dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
Each animal was welcomed Friday at various stations to be photographed,
microchipped and medically treated before going to its foster home.
A listing for each pet will be posted on the
Internet one month before it is available locally for adoption.
</P>
<P>
"It was important that they get out of Louisiana, because they're
dying where they stand," said Kim Finger, director of Rescue
for Ruffugees, which took in a planeload of 93 dogs
and 13 cats last month.
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of rescue groups in Los Angeles willing
to open up their facilities and houses to these pets."
</P>
<P>
The SPCA-LA, which took in the first flight of dogs and
cats last month from the hurricane-stricken area, said more than
half of its 118 dogs and seven cats are in
foster homes through December and the remainder are in area
shelters.
</P>
<P>
One dog was reunited last week with a single mother and
her son from New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
"We were all crying," said Madeline Bernstein, president of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Los Angeles. "We
feel great to be able to help these animals out."

As Valerie Bennett was evacuated from a New Orleans hospital, rescuers told her
there was no room in the boat for her dogs.
</P>
<P>
She pleaded. "I offered him my wedding ring and my mom's wedding ring," the
34-year-old nurse recalled Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They wouldn't budge. She and her husband could bring only one item, and they
already had a plastic tub containing the medicines her husband, a liver
transplant recipient, needed to survive.
</P>
<P>
Such emotional scenes were repeated perhaps thousands of times along the Gulf
Coast last week as pet owners were forced to abandon their animals in the midst
of evacuation.
</P>
<P>
In one example reported last week by The Associated Press, a police officer took
a dog from one little boy waiting to get on a bus in New Orleans. "Snowball!
Snowball!" the boy cried until he vomited. The policeman told a reporter he
didn't know what would happen to the dog.
</P>
<P>
The fate of pets is a huge but underappreciated cause of anguish for storm
survivors, said Richard Garfield, professor of international clinical nursing at
New York's Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
"People in shelters are worried about 'Did Fluffy get out?'" he said. "It's very
distressing for people, wondering if their pets are isolated or
starving."
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State Treasurer John Kennedy, who was helping with relief efforts
Saturday, said some evacuees refused to leave without their pets.
</P>
<P>
"One woman told me 'I've lost my house, my job, my car and I am not turning my
dog loose to starve,'" Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he persuaded refugees to get on the bus by telling them he would
have the animals taken to the Lamar Dixon center in Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
The SPCA picked up two cats and 15 dogs, including one Kennedy found tied up far
underneath the overpass next to an unopened can of dog food with a sign that
read "Please take care of my dog, his name is Chucky".
</P>
<P>
Valerie Bennett left her dogs with an anesthesiologist who was taking care of
about 30 staff members' pets on the roof of the hospital, Lindy Boggs Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
The doctor euthanized some animals at the request of their owners, who feared
they would be abandoned and starve to death. He set up a small gas chamber out
of a plastic-wrapped dog kennel.
</P>
<P>
"The bigger dogs were fighting it. Fighting the gas. It took them longer. When I
saw that, I said 'I can't do it,'" said Bennett's husband, Lorne.
</P>
<P>
But the anesthesiologist, a cat owner, promised to care for the other
pets.
</P>
<P>
"He said he'd stay there as long as he possibly could," Valerie Bennett
recalled, speaking from her husband's bedside at Atlanta's Emory University
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Bennetts had four animals, including their two beloved dogs _ Lorne's
English springer spaniel, Oreo, and Valerie's miniature dachshund,
Lady.
</P>
<P>
They moved to Slidell, Louisiana, in July when Valerie took a job at an organ
transplant institute connected to Lindy Boggs. Lorne, a former paramedic, is
disabled since undergoing a liver transplant in 2001.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, as Hurricane Katrina approached, both went to the hospital to help
and took all four animals with them.
</P>
<P>
Patients were evacuated starting Monday by rescue workers using small boats to
traverse the floodwaters surrounding the hospital. On Wednesday night, the
Bennetts were told they had to go, too.
</P>
<P>
They fed their guinea pig and left it in its cage in a patient room. They
couldn't refill its empty water bottle because the hospital's plumbing failed
Sunday, they said. They poured food on the floor for the cat, but again no
water.
</P>
<P>
"I just hope that they forgive me," Valerie Bennett cried.
</P>
<P>
They handed the dogs to the anesthesiologist. Valerie got his last name but no
cell phone number. "I wasn't thinking," she said.
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday afternoon, Valerie Bennett said she saw a posting on a Web site
called petfinder.com that said the anesthesiologist was still at Lindy Boggs
caring for the animals.

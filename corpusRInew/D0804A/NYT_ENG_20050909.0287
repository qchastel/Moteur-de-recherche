PASS CHRISTIAN, Miss.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The animal rescue team has come back
for Nike the cat.
</P>
<P>
Tramping through the debris left by Hurricane Katrina around the white
clapboard house, they see his fresh prints in the dark
brown mud. They'll return with a trap, trying to coax
him in with a can of Friskies.
</P>
<P>
If things go well, he'll soon join Danny, the poodle-mix dog,
at an animal shelter in Hattiesburg, Miss., about 80 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, they'll be reunited with their person, Rebecca Kutos . She's
in Rome, Ga., at her sister's house, trying to sort
out her life after the hurricane destroyed her home, her
car and the Isle of Capri casino in Biloxi, Miss.,
where she was a dealer.
</P>
<P>
Finding Kutos took a bit of detective work - just part
of the job description of a dedicated group of volunteers
and professionals from several states working under the auspices of
the Humane Society of the United States in this storm-ravaged
area.
</P>
<P>
Since the first handful of workers arrived immediately after Katrina, an
escalating effort has rescued more than 100 animals. Among them,
besides the usual variety of breeds of dogs and cats,
are six horses, an iguana, a hybrid bobcat and even
Callie, a sea lion from Marine Life in Gulfport.
</P>
<P>
Some animals have been surrendered by their owners, who can't care
for them in the storm's aftermath. If the owners agree,
they'll be put up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
Strays or displaced pets are usually reported by search-and-rescue teams, law
enforcement officers, clean-up and restoration workers, or neighbors. They're being
housed in Hattiesburg for 30 days to give their owners
a chance to find them.
</P>
<P>
In one Biloxi home at week's end, the animal searchers found
five dogs alive, but some discoveries have been grim. At
another Biloxi home, where neighbors said no one had been
for 10 days, a team found six kennel crates with
dead pit bulls inside.
</P>
<P>
Judy Roe, a Gulf Coast search-and-rescue worker going door to door
with search dogs in Pass Christian to find human beings
found Danny and got a glimpse of Nike.
</P>
<P>
She called Dee Thompson-Poirrier , director of animal control for Okaloosa
County, Fla., who is heading the Humane Society's animal rescue
operation on the Mississippi Coast. At the house where Danny
was found, Thompson-Poirrier picked up a soiled envelope with a
return address label. Inside was a card, signed "Love 
XXXXXXs, Mom." She tucked it into her pocket.
</P>
<P>
Thompson-Poirrier and her team took Danny to be evaluated and housed
temporarily in an $80,000 state-of-the-art trailer owned by Humane Society
volunteer Ronnie Graves of Bushnell, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Graves, who has a prosthetic leg because of a train accident,
is in the prosthetics business for humans and animals. He
bought the trailer and rig and outfitted it with a
generator, washer/dryer, portable toilet and shower, freezer and barbecue range.
The Humane Society furnished the kennels.
</P>
<P>
Graves saw the need during animal rescue efforts in Florida after
Hurricane Charlie last year. He had it ready to hit
the road at the beginning of this year's hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
When Thompson-Poirrier had a chance to examine the envelope in her
pocket, she called her ex-husband, who traced the Louisiana address.
A sheriff's deputy left a message at the house.
</P>
<P>
A man called to tell Thompson-Poirrier how to reach Kutos. She
was ecstatic at the news.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers say stories like that help answer the question they've all
heard - why spend time and money on animals when
humans are in dire straits?
</P>
<P>
Helping animals helps people, explained Sheri Evans of Sumter County, Fla.,
who's overseeing the intake process.
</P>
<P>
"We want to take care of animals to help their people
get back on their feet," Evans said.
</P>
<P>
Hearing that Danny is safe and that Nike has been sighted
gave Kutos a boost after her harrowing hurricane experience.
</P>
<P>
Hours after they were trapped in the attic by Hurricane Katrina's
rising water, she and her sister, Laurie Moody, saw hope
in an approaching Coast Guard helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Kutos ran to the window, waving a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guardsman came down, broke through the roof, and boosted
them upward in a wire basket, one by one.
</P>
<P>
Danny and Nike were left behind.
</P>
<P>
After spending the night at a Coast Guard facility, they took
a taxi to the Mobile, Ala., airport, rented a car
and went to Rome to be with their sister, Abigail
Pontiff. They still wore their filthy clothes. Kutos had only
her wallet.
</P>
<P>
Hearing that Danny has been rescued and Nike has been seen
is "like a miracle," she said. "I had such a
guilty feeling about leaving them up there alone. There's no
way to accept something like that."
</P>
<P>
As for the card Thompson-Poirrier picked up, it had pictures of
cats on the front. On the back was an insignia
- from the Humane Society of the United States.

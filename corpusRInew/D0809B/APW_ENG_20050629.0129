The attorney who wrote the article revealing Deep Throat's identity approached
the three years leading up to the Watergate whistleblower's "coming out party"
much as he would a court case.

To convince the world that Mark Felt was indeed Deep Throat, "I looked at it as
a trial in which the jury would be 1 billion people with a 48-hour deliberation
period," John O'Connor said Tuesday during a lunch organized by the Bar
Association of San Francisco.

Up to that point, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein had
steadfastly refused to reveal Deep Throat's identity. As it turned out, soon
after Felt came clean, they did too.

O'Connor says he met Felt, a frail 91-year-old former FBI agent, because his
daughter is friends with Felt's grandson. Three years later, when Felt decided
he was ready to reveal his role in history, O'Connor was ready with a national
media strategy and a breaking story for Vanity Fair.

"I had to put a very compelling case together in 15- and 30-second sound bites,"
O'Connor said. "My client doesn't remember things, and if he doesn't have a
voice now, then who better to speak for him than his lawyer?"
</P>
<P>
O'Connor wrote the article exposing his client as the Washington Post's
exclusive tipster during the Watergate scandal. Once the story appeared in
Vanity Fair, O'Connor took off to New York on a two-week talk show circuit. On
June 16, he signed a book deal and optioned the story to Universal for what he
calls "one hell of a movie."

Bob Woodward's book on "Deep Throat" 
will be rushed onto bookshelves by next month, his publisher said 
Thursday, two days after a monthly magazine revealed the famed 
Watergate source's real identity.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Simon and Schuster said Woodward was still 
working on the book, which carries the title "The Secret Man: The 
Story of Watergate's Deep Throat."
</P>
<P>
In the volume, which will be published in July, Woodward will 
discuss how he first met Mark Felt and how the former FBI official 
became the legendary secret source whose insider guidance was so 
critical to The Washington Post's coverage of the Watergate 
scandal.
</P>
<P>
"Bob Woodward's account will be the true final piece of the 
Watergate puzzle," said David Rosenthal, executive vice president of 
Simon and Schuster.
</P>
<P>
Woodward had been preparing his Deep Throat book for some time, 
with a view to publishing after Felt, now 91, died.
</P>
<P>
However, the unexpected revelation of Felt's secret in Vanity 
Fair magazine on Tuesday, meant the project was moved onto the fast 
track.
</P>
<P>
Woodward has authored or co-authored 10 number one national 
non-fiction best-sellers, including the "All the President's Men" 
(1974) -- the definitive account of how he and fellow Post 
journalist Carl Bernstein unravelled the Watergate scandal that 
brought down president Richard Nixon.

Former FBI agent Felt almost revealed he was Deep Throat in 
1976: report

<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, July 1
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former FBI agent Mark Felt, 91, who 
in April revealed he was Deep Throat, the key secret source in the 
Watergate scandal, gave himself away at a grand jury hearing in 
1976, The Washington Post said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Asked directly by then assistant Attorney General Stanley 
Pottinger if he was Deep Throat, Felt said "No" but with such a 
stunned look on his face that Pottinger surmised he was lying, the 
daily said quoting from an upcoming book.
</P>
<P>
The news came in Bob Woodward's book, "The Secret Man," which 
was rushed into publication following the revelation of Deep 
Throat's name two and a half months ago, said the daily. Woodward, 
now an assistant managing editor at the Post, was a reporter when 
his friend Felt confided government secrets to him.
</P>
<P>
Based in part on Felt's inside information, Woodward along with 
fellow Post reporter Carl Bernstein, wrote the articles about the 
involvement of Nixon administration officials in the June 1972 
burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at 
Washington's Watergate complex.
</P>
<P>
The scandal and the White House's attempted cover-up ultimately 
led to Richard Nixon becoming the first US president to resign in 
disgrace, in August 1974.
</P>
<P>
At the 1976 hearing, Pottinger reminded Felt he was under oath 
and withdrew his question as irrelevant to the subject of 
investigation at the time, but he told Woodward later of his 
conclusion, adding that he would keep it to himself.
</P>
<P>
"To his eternal credit" he did just that, wrote Woodward, who 
did not confirm Pottinger's suspicion, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Felt was convicted in the Watergate scandal, but was later 
pardoned by president Ronald Reagan.

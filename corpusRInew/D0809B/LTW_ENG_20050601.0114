Deep Throat's Revelation Gives Voice to Hindsight
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day after the disclosure that former FBI Deputy
Director W. Mark Felt was Deep Throat, Washington was awash with
claims from political celebrities and minor Watergate figures that
they'd known the identity of the secret source all along.
</P>
<P>
Nora Ephron, the screenwriter and author who was once married to
Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein -- who with colleague Bob
Woodward played leading roles in exposing Watergate -- put out word on
a blog that ``I knew that Deep Throat was Mark Felt because I figured
it out.''
</P>
<P>
Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen wrote Wednesday that, even
though he once reported that a mere Secret Service technician could
have been Deep Throat, ``I always suspected it was'' Felt.
</P>
<P>
And longtime Washington pundit Robert Novak topped them all. Even
though Deep Throat's identity had been one of Washington's most
enduring and fascinating mysteries, Novak declared that just about
everyone in the Capital had known all along.
</P>
<P>
The morning-after rush to claim prescience was one more indication,
if one were needed, that to Washingtonians, the worst crime is being
out of the loop.
</P>
<P>
Ephron, whose first novel, ``Heartburn,'' was based on her marriage
to Bernstein and became a 1986 movie directed by Mike Nichols, said on
her blog that she did not learn of Felt's identity from her husband.
</P>
<P>
She said ``he was far too intelligent to tell me a secret like
that. He refused to tell his children too, who are also my children,
so I told them, and they told others, and even so, years passed and no
one really listened to any of us.
</P>
<P>
''Years passed while unbelievably idiotic ideas of who Deep Throat
was were floated by otherwise intelligent people,`` Efron preened.
</P>
<P>
Novak, who writes a column for the Chicago Sun-Times that is
nationally syndicated, was recently in the news for a controversy
about a secret source. Novak disclosed Valerie Plame's identity as a
CIA operative -- based on a government leak that has sparked a federal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
In a column posted Wednesday, Novak wrote that he was not alone in
suspecting Deep Throat's identity.
</P>
<P>
It was virtually an open secret in Washington, he said: ''Everybody
knew that Felt was leaking information to Woodward and Bernstein about
the Watergate investigation.
</P>
<P>
``The reporters made no secret of the fact that they were getting
leaks from inside the FBI, and it was presumed that Felt was one of
the leakers.''
</P>
<P>
Tom Brokaw, the former NBC anchor who covered the Nixon White
House, said he deduced that Felt was the source because Woodward and
Bernstein had pledged to keep Deep Throat's identity a secret until
after he died -- and few credible candidates were left on a short
list.
</P>
<P>
``Well I had for a long time felt that he was kind of the last
surviving possibility,'' Brokaw said on MSNBC's ``Hardball with Chris
Matthews'' on Tuesday night. ``There were a lot of people on that list
for awhile. And they all seemed to fall away, either by absolute
denials or they didn't match up (with) all the various criteria.''
</P>
<P>
Some journalists did divine that Felt was Deep Throat, including
James Mann, a former Los Angeles Times correspondent. In an Atlantic
Monthly article in 1992, Mann wrote that Deep Throat clearly was an
FBI man.
</P>
<P>
And Ephron once rejected speculation by former White House counsel
John W. Dean III that Nixon speechwriter David Gergen was Deep Throat
by saying Gergen was ``too tall'' to have fit into the parking garage
where Woodward met the source.
</P>
<P>
``They used to say the eighth deadly sin in Washington was losing,
and the new one is being out of the loop,'' said Gergen, a Nixon
adviser who said he was relieved to have the cloud of suspicion lifted
from his head.
</P>
<P>
``Some of us have been in the lineup for about 30 years,'' he said.

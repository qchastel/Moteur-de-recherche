Deep Throat Family Cuts Book, Film Deals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deep Throat has a book deal and a movie deal, and he could end up
being played by Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
The family of 91-year-old Mark Felt, who revealed his role as The
Washington Post's key Watergate source two weeks ago, has chosen
PublicAffairs Books to publish a combination of autobiography and
biography, publisher and CEO Peter Osnos said Wednesday night. Osnos
said that Universal Pictures has optioned Felt's life story and the
book for a movie to be developed by Hanks' production company,
Playtone.
</P>
<P>
He said the book will blend Felt's own writing about his life,
including his out-of-print 1979 memoir, ``The FBI Pyramid: From the
Inside,'' and some unpublished material, with contributions from
Felt's family and from lawyer John O'Connor, who has been advising the
Felts. O'Connor wrote the Vanity Fair article that named Felt as Deep
Throat after the secret had been kept for 33 years.
</P>
<P>
The additional material from Felt, Osnos said, includes discussion
of how he decided to provide guidance to Post reporter Bob Woodward,
and why.
</P>
<P>
The book is to be published next spring. Its working title is ``A
G-Man's Life: The FBI, Being 'Deep Throat' and the Struggle for Honor
in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
David Kuhn, the New York-based agent who has been representing the
family in conjunction with Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Creative
Artists Agency, said Wednesday night that ``Hanks' company was
interested in the rights to the story within a day or two'' of the
revelation of Deep Throat's identity. He said the movie deal was
concluded Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Kuhn would not comment on the sums paid in either the book or the
movie deal, except to say that the family's decision on the book ``was
not based on money'' but rather on the vision for its publication put
forth by Osnos, a former Washington Post reporter and editor who
helped cover the Senate Watergate hearings.
</P>
<P>
PublicAffairs generally doesn't pay advances of more than $75,000.
</P>
<P>
Neither Felt's daughter, Joan, nor his son, Mark Jr., returned
phone calls Wednesday night. Kuhn said they would be ``interviewed for
the book and would participate in the storytelling.''
</P>
<P>
During the two weeks the Felt project was being shopped, it met
with considerable skepticism from publishers. The two reasons usually
cited were the health of the elderly Felt, whose physical and mental
deterioration appeared to preclude new contributions from him, and the
presence of a competing book from Woodward, who had already written
his own version of the Deep Throat story.
</P>
<P>
Woodward's ``The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat''
is being rushed into print. His publisher, Simon  Schuster, has set a
publication date of July 6.
</P>
<P>
Warner Books publisher Jamie Raab said last week that she had heard
the Felt pitch and decided not to bid. ``The book is not a Watergate
book per se,'' Raab said. ``It's not going to answer some of the
lingering questions. ... They're sort of writing around Mark Felt's
life.''
</P>
<P>
Little, Brown editor Geoff Shandler expressed skepticism as well,
but he didn't rule out the success of a Felt book. ``Traveling in
Woodward's wake could be a profitable place to be, depending on what
you pay and when you publish,'' Shandler said. ``There is an equation
that would work.''
</P>
<P>
But publishing executives agreed that the real money was on the
Hollywood end.

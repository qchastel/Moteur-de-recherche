Unmasking of `Deep Throat' Lifts Suspicion of Others
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The revelation that Mark Felt was the storied source who helped set
in motion the events that ended a presidency not only resolved one of
the United States' great political mysteries, it liberated a gallery
of other high-profile figures from decades of speculation.
</P>
<P>
Ferreting out Deep Throat's identity has long been a favorite topic
in Washington and beyond, and the search has engaged former Nixon
administration officials who dealt with the consequences of his leaks,
intrepid journalism students eager to solve one of a prior
generation's abiding enigmas, and many an armchair sleuth.
</P>
<P>
But then-deputy White House counsel Fred Fielding, onetime Nixon
aide Alexander Haig, speechwriter Patrick Buchanan and many others who
have been mentioned as possible candidates -- in some cases based on
circumstantial evidence at best -- may finally face fewer questions
about the famous disclosures of over three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
``It ends the speculation,'' said Leonard Garment, who served as
acting White House counsel during the investigation into the Watergate
break-in, and published a book called ``In Search of Deep Throat'' in
2000. ``Every good secret deserves a decent burial.''
</P>
<P>
If so, then people have been clamoring to deliver the eulogy for
years. Some even claimed that Deep Throat -- played by Hal Holbrook in
the film ``All the President's Men'' -- was actually an amalgam of
different sources who provided Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward
and Carl Bernstein with key information for their reporting.
</P>
<P>
Others have focused on specific individuals, doggedly studying who
might have had access to what kind of information, and
cross-referencing that detective work with other sources, including
the book by Woodward and Bernstein upon which the film was based.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, after a four-year investigation, a journalism class
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found ``Fielding to
be the most likely Throat candidate,'' according to a summary on
deepthroatuncovered.com. Tuesday, after Woodward confirmed that Felt
was Deep Throat, William Gaines, the professor involved, said he and
his students accepted that. Fielding, who according to media reports
had denied that he was Deep Throat, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
Another strain of thought focused on officials in the FBI. In 1992,
20 years after Watergate, James Mann -- a former colleague of Woodward
and Bernstein at The Washington Post -- laid out the tension between
the White House and the FBI in the wake of J. Edgar Hoover's death in
May 1972, months before the Watergate break-in.
</P>
<P>
Mann, writing in the Atlantic magazine, stated flatly that he did
not know who Deep Throat was.
</P>
<P>
But, Mann wrote, ``He could well have been Mark Felt ... Felt was
known in Washington as a person willing to talk to the press. He has
denied that he was Deep Throat.''

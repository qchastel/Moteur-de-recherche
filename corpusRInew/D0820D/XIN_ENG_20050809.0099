Russia has decided to buy two 
deep-diving Scorpio rescue vehicles to boost its rescue 
capabilities following a submarine accident that trapped seven 
crewmembers for three days after the mini-submarine got entangled 
with fishing nets and an antenna on the Pacific seabed.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov decided to buy two 
remote-controlled, deep-diving Scorpio underwater vehicles for the
Russian navy, Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Viktor Fyodorov told
the Itar-Tass news agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The AS-28 mini-submarine, itself meant for rescue operations, 
got ensnarled Thursday night by fishing nets and an antenna of 
Russia's coastal monitoring system on the seabed off the Kamchatka
Peninsula and was lifted to surface Sunday with all the crew 
members alive.
</P>
<P>
The crew was salvaged at the end of an around-the-clock rescue 
operation that was assisted by a British Scorpio underwater 
vehicle, which was submerged to cut the entanglements.
</P>
<P>
Russia was quick to ask for international help after the 
accident occurred. Britain and the United States airlifted Scorpio
submersibles to join the rescue work.
</P>
<P>
The lobster-shaped Scorpios are equipped with black and white 
video cameras, two robotic arms that can each lift about 250 
pounds and a cable cutter that can slice through 2.54 cm-thick 
steel cables.

<P>
The British Scorpio played a key role in the operation to free 
the submarine, Fyodorov said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to buy Scorpios came a day after Fyodorov 
underlined the need to have efficient rescue equipment in the wake
of the submarine accident.
</P>
<P>
The Russian navy "has advanced submarines but does not have 
efficient rescue vehicles," he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"If we had had a rescue vehicle of this kind, we could have 
rescued the mini-submarine within a day," Fyodorov said.

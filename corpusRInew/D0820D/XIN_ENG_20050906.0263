Violations of operating procedures 
caused the Russian mini-submarine to be stranded on the Pacific 
seabed for three days last month, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov 
said Tuesday citing results of a probe into the accident.

"A scrupulous investigation into the accident has been 
conducted within a month's time, as was promised. It was 
established that outrageous violation of the instructions by 
senior officials of the Russian Pacific Fleet was the main cause 
of wrong 'swimming and diving rounds'", Ivanov told reporters, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.

The AS-28 mini-submarine was ensnarled on the Pacific seabed 
off the Kamchatka Peninsula for nearly three days in early August 
and was eventually lifted to surface with all crew members alive 
in a rescue operation aided by a deep-diving British Scorpio 
rescue vehicle.

Newly appointed Navy Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Masorin said 
Monday investigators of the accident found the crew had made 
errors operating the craft.

Masorin also said the navy is considering buying a Scorpio 
submersible rescue vehicle.

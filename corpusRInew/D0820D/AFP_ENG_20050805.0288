<P>
Japan on Friday dispatched four military 
ships to help Russia rescue seven crew members aboard a small 
submarine trapped on the seabed in the Far East, officials said.
</P>
<P>
But the ships, which have 370 Japanese military personnel on 
board, are likely to need until early Monday to reach the stranded 
submarine, a Defense Agency spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Pacific Fleet said the crew had 120 hours of oxygen 
reserves on board when the submarine submerged at midday Thursday 
(2300 GMT Wednesday) off the Kamchatka peninsula, the stretch of Far 
Eastern Russia facing the Bering Sea.
</P>
<P>
Japan dispatched a submarine-rescue vessel, the Chiyoda, and a 
depot ship from Yokosuka port near Tokyo and two minesweepers from 
the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, the defense spokesman 
said.
</P>
<P>
"We will do our utmost efforts to rescue them. We are hopeful," 
he said.
</P>
<P>
The assistance comes despite rocky relations between Japan and 
Russia, which have yet to formally end World War II amid Japan's 
claims to four islands off Hokkaido that Soviet troops seized in 
August 1945.
</P>
<P>
"We received a request from Russia and the dispatch was decided 
accordingly," said a foreign ministry official who deals with 
Russian affairs.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Interfax-AVN military news agency said the Russians 
hoped the stranded mini-submarine would be raised to the surface 
before the Japanese ships arrive.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the assistance from our Japanese colleagues will not be 
necessary," Admiral Viktor Dmitriyev, commander of the Russian 
Pacific Fleet, was quoted by the agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The mini-submarine, designed for research, rescue and 
intelligence operations, was resting on the seabed at a depth of 
about 200 meters (656 feet).
</P>
<P>
Specialists said it could have become tangled up with a metal 
cable or in sunken nets from a fishing trawler, according to Russian 
news reports.
</P>
<P>
The small submarine was in the Bay of Berezovaya about 75 
kilometres (46 miles) from the coastal town of 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy on the Kamchatka peninsula.

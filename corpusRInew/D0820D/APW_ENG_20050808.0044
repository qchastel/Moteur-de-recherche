'It was cold, cold, very cold,' says survivor on trapped Russian mini-sub

</DATELINE>

Russian crewmen walked ashore unsteadily, rescued from a three-day ordeal after
their mini-submarine surfaced with all seven crew members safe after being
trapped deep under the Pacific Ocean in the frigid darkness.
</P>
<P>
"It was cold, cold, very cold. I can't even describe it," one crew member with
reddish hair said as the sailors walked ashore Sunday with dazed looks and
bloodshot eyes after their submarine was cut loose from fishing net cables that
had snagged it by a British remote-controlled rescue vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Commander Ian Riches, the British Royal Navy officer who led the successful
operation using the remote-controlled Super Scorpio, hailed the joint rescue
mission with the Russian Pacific Fleet as a "marvelous example" of international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"It was a difficult operation, but we enjoyed doing it," he said as he arrived
ashore at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the early hours of Monday local time "The
team are over the moon that we have got these guys out alive," he added, saying
he was "elated."
</P>
<P>
The men aboard the AS-28 mini-submarine _ six sailors and a representative of
the company that made the ship _ opened the hatch and climbed out without
assistance, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Six were taken to a hospital on the mainland for examination, waving to
relatives as they went in. The seventh was kept aboard a hospital ship for
unspecified reasons. They appeared to be in "satisfactory" condition, naval
spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said.
</P>
<P>
At the edge of the gangplank leading off the ship that brought the crew to
shore, the submarine's commander Lt. Vyacheslav Milashevsky held a long and
solemn salute, then a slight smile crossed his face.
</P>
<P>
He was pale but told journalists he felt "fine" before climbing into a van with
the others for the trip to the hospital. Another crew member in the van looked
from side to side, gazing at the green trees and gray skies.
</P>
<P>
Milashevsky's wife, Yelena, said earlier that she was overjoyed upon hearing
about the rescue. "I was happy. I cried from happiness. I danced," she told
Channel One television.
</P>
<P>
The men had worn thermal suits to protect them against temperatures of about 4.4
degrees Celsius (40 degrees Fahrenheit) and were told to lie flat and breathe as
lightly as possible during the rescue effort, officials said. To conserve
electricity, lights were turned off and contact with the surface was kept to a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
The crew member with reddish hair said he felt OK and was eager to be reunited
with his wife and daughter. He was then ushered into the van taking the men to
the hospital and did not reply when asked his name.
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities thanked the British and praised the international rescue
effort that included the United States, but criticism quickly arose over why the
nation's once-formidable navy needed outside help.
</P>
<P>
The relief over the successful rescue attempt was in sharp contrast to the
sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine in August 2000, when Russian authorities
held off asking for outside assistance until hope was nearly exhausted; all 118
crew members died.
</P>
<P>
President Vladimir Putin was criticized then for reluctance to seek
international help and for remaining on vacation as the disaster unfolded. The
president has been silent through the present crisis as well, although his
spokesman Alexei Gromov said Putin was grateful to all those involved in the
rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov, who supervised the rescue operation from a navy
ship, clenched his fists and shook them in happiness when he saw the
red-and-white-striped sub surfacing.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen in deeds, not in words, what the brotherhood of the sea means," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry also issued a statement praising the joint actions of the
Russian, British and U.S. militaries in the "unique rescue operation." It also
thanked Japan, which it said also responded to the request for
help.
</P>
<P>
The United States sent remote-controlled underwater vehicles for the rescue.
They arrived several hours later and were not used, but three American divers
and a doctor accompanied the British vessel on its mission.
</P>
<P>
The jubilation came after three tense days that started Thursday when the
13.4-meter (44-foot) submarine got stranded in 180 meters ( 590 feet) of water
about 15 kilometers (10 miles) off Kamchatka's east coast.
</P>
<P>
Russian ships first tried to tow the sub to shallower water where divers could
reach it but were able to move it only about 80 meters (90 yards) in Beryozovaya
Bay.
</P>
<P>
The British Super Scorpio, sent in response to Russia's urgent call for help,
arrived Saturday and spent six hours the next day cutting away the fishing net
cables that had snarled the Russian vessel and its propeller.
</P>
<P>
Riches said the most nerve-racking point in the operation was when the Russian
submarine broke free from the cables and disappeared from the camera's sight
before surfacing about 4:26 p.m.
</P>
<P>
"She moved and we lost her out of the camera...and it was then waiting on the
surface waiting for her to arrive. Whether she's going to make it all the way
up, we didn't know where she was after that. That was really the tensest
moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The circumstances surrounding the cause of the accident remained
unclear.
</P>
<P>
Putin ordered the defense minister to launch an investigation. Dygalo declined
comment when asked about how the sub was trapped, saying only that it had been
"engaged in planned maneuvers."
</P>
<P>
Some naval officials had said the submarine was participating in a combat
training exercise when it got caught on an underwater antenna assembly that is
part of a coastal monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
But Riches, the British commander, said the vessel had become tangled in fishing
nets, as had been originally reported.
</P>
<P>
"The submarine was caught very firm into the fishing nets and had driven into
them so that they were very tight and they actually looked and behaved like
steel wires, so it was very, very difficult to cut through with cutting
implements," Riches told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Russia's cash-strapped navy apparently lacks rescue vehicles capable of
operating at the depth where the sub was stranded.
</P>
<P>
The new crisis indicated that Putin's promises to improve the navy's equipment
have had little effect. He was sharply criticized for his slow response to the
Kursk crisis and reluctance to accept foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
New criticism arose within hours of Sunday's rescue. Dmitry Rogozin, head of the
nationalist Rodina party in the lower house of parliament, said he would demand
an assessment from the Military Prosecutor's Office of the navy's performance in
the incident, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Rogozin said he wants to know why Russia has not acquired underwater vehicles
similar to the ones provided by Britain and the United States and "why fishing
nets and cables litter the area of naval maneuvers."

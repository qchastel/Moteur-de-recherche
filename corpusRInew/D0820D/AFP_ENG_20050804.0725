The Russian military was 
racing against time early Friday to rescue a small submarine that 
had become trapped on the seabed with seven crew aboard, the 
Ria-Novosti news agency reported.

<P>
The bathyscaphe submersible had only 24 hours of oxygen in 
reserve when it became stuck late Thursday at a depth of 190 metres 
(623 feet) in the bay of Kamchatka in far eastern Russia, a military 
source told the agency.

The source, who did not want to be identified, said the 
mini-submarine had become attached to an as yet unidentified object 
during a routine exercise in the Bay of Berezovaya, about 75 
kilometres (46 miles) from the town of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskyi.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said it could have become tangled up with a metal 
cable or a sunken trawler, the report said.

<P>
A spokesman for the Pacific fleet said the crew's condition was 
"normal". The military prosecutor has opened an inquiry.

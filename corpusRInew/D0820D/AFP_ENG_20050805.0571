<P>
Rescue of a submarine stuck on the seabed 
off Russia's east coast is complicated because it is snagged in an 
underwater surveillance antenna system as well as snared in a 
fishing net, a senior Russian naval officer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A remote-controlled device was lowered to the stricken vessel 
"to cut the flexible tubes and cables of the coastal surveillance 
antenna in which the AS-28 vehicle is caught," Rear Admiral Vladimir 
Pepelayev was quoted by RIA-Novosti news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The commander of Russia's Pacific Fleet, Admiral Viktor 
Fyodorov, separately told the NTV television network that rescuers 
"succeeded in moving one kilometer the entire system that the 
submarine is trapped in, including the system's anchor."
</P>
<P>
He did not provide further details on the "system" he was 
referring to, but said all of it, including the submarine, were 
being towed to shallower waters, a process he said could take a 
number of hours.
</P>
<P>
Pepelayev made no mention of movement of the "system," but said 
either rescuers would manage to cut the submarine free from it or a 
tug-boat would pull the 60-ton anchor of the system out of the 
seabed, enabling rescuers to refloat the submarine.
</P>
<P>
There are seven crew members aboard the vessel, stranded on the 
ocean floor at a depth of around 190 meters (623 feet) in a bay off 
the coast of the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's Far East region.
</P>
<P>
There were widely varying accounts of how much oxygen was 
remaining for the crew, but Fyodorov and other officials said they 
had reserves sufficient to last at least another day.

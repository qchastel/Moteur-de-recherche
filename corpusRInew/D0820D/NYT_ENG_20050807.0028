A small Russian submarine was freed on Sunday from
its undersea entanglement of the Far East coast by an
unmanned British rescue vehicle that cut away the nets that
ensnared it. All seven crew members were alive and rushed
aboard a Russian surface vessel, where they were being examined
by a medical team, Russian news agencies and the U.S.
Navy said.

The vessel rose to the surface at 4:26 p.m. local time,
ending the crew's ordeal in the cold and darkness more
than 600 feet below the surface off the Kamchatka Peninsula.
There remained uncertainties about how the submersible, a 44-foot rescue
vessel, became disabled, and exactly what immobilized it.

Throughout the rescue operation, Russian officers spoke of cables and hoses
that held the craft fast, while Western naval officials said
fishing nets had trapped the craft. The disentanglement and ascent
of the small submarine, trapped since Thurssday, was an utterly
different outcome from Russia's last prominent submarine crisis, in 2000,
when the nuclear submarine Kursk sank after on-board explosions in
shallow water in the Barents Sea. Russia resisted international assistance
in that crisis, and made a series of false statements
about its problems at sea.

As the British sailors worked, Russian officials said the submarine's crew
of seven men were alive and had donned thermal suits,
huddled together in a single compartment and were minimizing their
movements to conserve their remaining air.

<P>
Power had been all but shut down inside the sunken vessel
and its heater turned off to save its dwindling energy
reserves, rendering the titanium-hulled craft a chilled, dark tube.

The British reached the scene first in part because they had
a shorter flight to get their Scorpio to Russia. But
it also took Americans four hours longer than expected Friday
to load the Scorpios onto a cargo plane in San
Diego, with both the Air Force and the Navy citing
each other for contributing to some of the delay.
</P>
<P>
Still, American officials said the rescue was a testament to the
intense efforts that have been made to increase cooperation among
navies since the Kursk sunk. "The close team work and
global coordination between our navies to rescue these sailors in
such a short time is testimony to the spirit and
determination of our nations," said Adm. Gary Roughead, commander of
the US Pacific Fleet.

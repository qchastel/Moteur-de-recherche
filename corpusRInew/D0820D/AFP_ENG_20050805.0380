<P>
Britain's Royal Navy is to join efforts to 
free the crew of a Russian mini-submarine trapped on the ocean 
floor, sending a remote control submersible to the scene, officials 
in London said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The underwater vehicle is equipped with cameras and an arm to 
help free the submarine, which is trapped after part of a fishing 
net became entangled in its propeller.
</P>
<P>
"It will be able to hopefully free the men," a Ministry of 
Defence spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A Royal Air Force C-17 transport plane was due to fly to Glasgow 
to collect the remote control device, and would arrive in Russia on 
Saturday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The submersible would then be taken to the accident scene on the 
Kamchatka peninsula in the country's far east.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, the US navy's Pacific Fleet said it was 
airlifting two remotely operated submersible vehicles to the site to 
help with rescue efforts, while Japan has also dispatched four 
military ships.
</P>
<P>
Seven Russian sailors are thought to be on the mini-submarine, 
designed for use in rescue, research and intelligence-gathering 
missions.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian navy, the submarine only has 24 hours 
of oxygen left.

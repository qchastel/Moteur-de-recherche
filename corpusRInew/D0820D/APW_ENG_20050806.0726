Rescue crews on Sunday lowered a British remote-controlled underwater vehicle to
a Russian mini-submarine trapped deep under the Pacific Ocean, hoping to free
the vessel and its seven trapped crewmen before their air supply ran
out.
</P>
<P>
British crews, who arrived some hours earlier at the remote Kamchatka Peninsula,
were working with Russian naval authorities to maneuver the Super Scorpio
unmanned robotic vehicle and untangle the AS-28, which was caught up by a
military listening antenna 190 meters (625 feet) below the surface nearly three
days ago.
</P>
<P>
Capt. Igor Dygalo told The Associated Press that workers lowered the Super
Scorpio at around 11:30 a.m. local time (2230 GMT) at the site in Beryozovaya
Bay about 15 kilometers (10 miles) off the east coast of the peninsula, north of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Super Scorpio then began cutting cables that had tangled the sub, Russian
news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Russian rescuers looped cables under the antenna and were hoping to
bring both it and the 44-foot(13.2-meter)-long sub closer to the surface, where
divers could reach the crew.
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities hope British and American unmanned submersibles, sent after
a Russian plea for help, can cut the submarine loose. They are trying
desperately to avoid losing a sub crew as they did with the Kursk nuclear
submarine, which sank almost exactly five years ago, killing all 118
aboard.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. crew with two other Super Scorpio vehicles, meanwhile, was also making
its way to the site after landing later on the rain-soaked peninsula.
</P>
<P>
As the American submersibles and crews were being loaded onto ships near the
port of Petropavlovsky-Kamchatsky, Cmdr. Bill Hamblet, an assistant U.S. naval
attache helping the operation, said the three countries were cooperating
together with their best equipment and teams.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to do anything at that depth, but everyone will try and do their best
to save the crew," he told AP. "Together the three countries will pull this
off."
</P>
<P>
Navy estimates of how long the air would last ranged from the end of Saturday
until Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian navy made contact with the crew late Saturday, and Pacific Fleet
commander Adm. Viktor Fyodorov said their condition was "satisfactory" despite
temperatures of 5-7 degrees Celsius (41-45 degrees Fahrenheit).
</P>
<P>
"They're not giving up hope," Fyodorov said in televised comments.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you, work is continuing without interruption through night and day and
will not stop until we actually lift our guys up to the surface," he said. It
wasn't clear if contact with the crew was made by radio or through some other
means, but officials said it was taking place every few hours.
</P>
<P>
Russia's plea for international assistance underlined the deficiencies of its
once-mighty navy and strongly contrasted with the August 2000 sinking of the
Kursk, when authorities held off asking for help until hope was nearly
exhausted. Some of the 118 crew survived for many hours as breathable air ran
out.
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. Vladimir Pepelyayev, deputy head of the navy's general staff, said the
air would likely last to the end of the day and possibly through Sunday.
Fyodorov gave a similar estimate, but later was quoted by the Interfax news
agency as saying there was enough to last until Monday.
</P>
<P>
"They have the air. But you can imagine their state of mind after two days,"
Pepelyayev said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Russian submarine was participating in a combat training
exercise and got snarled on an underwater antenna assembly that is part of a
coastal monitoring system. The system is anchored with a weight of about 60
metric tons (66 short tons), according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Russia's cash-strapped navy apparently lacks rescue vehicles capable of
operating at the depth where the sub is stranded, and officials say it is too
deep for divers or for the crew to swim out on their own. An earlier attempt to
drag the vessel to shallower waters failed when cables detached after pulling it
some 60 meters (65 yards).
</P>
<P>
"We won't try to drag it anymore; we will try to lift the whole system, rip it
off and bring it to the surface," Fyodorov said. He said rescuers would try to
raise the vessel by lifting with enough force to pull two heavy concrete anchors
from the sea floor.
</P>
<P>
The new crisis indicated that promises by President Vladimir Putin to improve
the navy's equipment apparently have had little effect. He was sharply
criticized for his slow response to the Kursk crisis and reluctance to accept
foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
By early Sunday, Putin had made no public comment on the latest sinking, but
Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov flew to Kamchatka and was traveling to the site
of the rescue operation.

NEW YORK -- Martha Stewart says she has been deluged by
``thousands'' of letters from fans sent to her federal prison camp in
Alderson, W.V., some of which have even included gifts and money.
</P>
<P>
But, she lamented, the gifts are not allowed to reach her.
</P>
<P>
In a posting on her Web site, marthatalks.com, Stewart instead
urged fans to make a donation to the American Cancer Society instead.
</P>
<P>
``I continue to be touched by the outpouring of support I have
received from so many of you,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
``I am also touched that supporters have sent . . . thousands of
letters to me. I have been told that some of these letters have
included gifts and money. Please know that while these gestures of
friendship and support are deeply appreciated, any such items must be
returned to the sender by prison officials.''
</P>
<P>
``Instead, if you are so inclined, please make a donation to the
American Cancer Society, a charitable organization that means a lot to
me,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
Stewart will complete the second week of a five-month prison term
Friday for lying to the federal government about a stock transaction.
</P>
<P>
Dawn Zobel, a public information officer at Alderson, said she
could neither confirm nor deny that Stewart has been the recipient of
such a tsunami of mail.
</P>
<P>
However Zobel said inmate mail is subject to inspection for
contraband or other banned items before it leaves the prison's postal
facility. If the package or letter is deemed inappropriate it will be
returned.
</P>
<P>
Ana Marengo, a spokesman for the American Cancer Society in New
York, said Stewart and her company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia,
have long had a team that participates in an annual walk in Central
Park -- ``Making Strides'' -- to raise money for breast cancer
research. Stewart participated with her team in last year's walk,
Marengo said.
</P>
<P>
During this year's walk, held last Sunday, Stewart's MSO team
raised $31,000. She said the American Cancer Society would keep a link
on its Web site, www.cancer.org/makingstrides, that allows Martha fans
to donate money via Stewart's team for about the next month.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Stewart did not return calls for comment.

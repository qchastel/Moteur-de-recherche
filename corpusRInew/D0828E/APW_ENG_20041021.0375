Martha Stewart learning microwave cooking in prison, lawyer says

Homemaking mogul Martha Stewart is using her prison time to figure
out "innovative ways to do microwave cooking" to share with fellow
inmates and is being treated with respect, her lawyer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"She's making the best of what's necessarily a difficult situation,"
lawyer Walter Dellinger said on NBC's "Today." "There is no freedom.
It's regimented. She has no privacy. They are subject to strip
searches. But she's so resilient."
</P>
<P>
Stewart is in the first month of a five-month sentence at the
minimum-security federal women's prison in Alderson, West Virginia.
She appealed her conviction late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Because inmates can only use a microwave to do their own cooking,
Stewart is working with fellow prisoners to "come up with some
creative recipes" based on the limited number of ingredients
available at the prison commissary, Dellinger said.
</P>
<P>
"She has a group that is cooking," he said. "She is trying to figure
out innovative ways to do microwave cooking which is all they have."
</P>
<P>
"What she likes best about it, I think, is how much she likes the
fellow inmates and the people who run the prison facility at
Alderson, and the respect that they all seem to have for each other,"
Dellinger said.
</P>
<P>
Dellinger, who visited Stewart in prison Oct. 13, also said she
performed sanitation chores, such as cleaning toilets.
</P>
<P>
Stewart spends up to three hours a night writing on a prison
typewriter with ribbons purchased at a prison store, he said.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said he did not know what she is writing, but Stewart has
suggested since her conviction that she might write a book about her
recent experience with the legal system.

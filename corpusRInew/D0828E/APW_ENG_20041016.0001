Home fashion guru Martha Stewart said on Friday that she has adjusted
to prison life and is keeping busy behind bars since reporting a week
ago to a federal penal camp in West Virginia, where she is serving a
five-month sentence for lying about a stock sale.

The celebrity homemaker said she was touched by the outpouring of
support she has received from millions of people who have visited her
Web site, according to a letter posted by Stewart on
www.marthatalks.com.

Stewart, who reported to Alderson Federal Prison Camp before sunrise
last Friday, said life at the camp held few surprises.

<P>
"The camp is fine; it is pretty much what I anticipated," she said in
her Internet posting.
</P>
<P>
"The best news _ everyone is nice _ both the officials and my fellow
inmates," the letter continued. "I have adjusted and am very busy.
The camp is like an old-fashioned college campus _ without the
freedom, of course."

Stewart, 63, was convicted last March of lying to investigators about
why she sold stock in a biotech drug maker in December 2001, just
before its price plunged. The home fashion mogul is continuing to
appeal her conviction.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American style guru Martha Stewart reported to a prison known as
"Camp Cupcake" on Friday to start a five-month sentence for lying
about a dodgy stock sale.
</P>
<P>
The multimillionaire founder of the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
lifestyle empire entered the minimum-security federal prison camp in
Alderson, West Virginia at 6:15 am (1015 GMT), the Justice Department
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Stewart, 63, was convicted in March of obstructing justice and making
false statements to federal agents investigating her sale of nearly
4,000 shares in the biotechnology company ImClone Systems.
</P>
<P>
"While I am away, my updates here will be less frequent, if not
altogether impossible," Stewart said in a message to supporters
posted on her website.
</P>
<P>
"But please know this change is only an unfortunate reflection of my
current circumstances, and in no way diminishes my commitment to my
life's work or to the friends, colleagues, customers and supporters
who make it possible," she said.
</P>
<P>
When Stewart was sentenced in July, the judge allowed her to remain
free pending an appeal. Last month, however, Stewart asked to begin
serving her time as soon as possible in order to put the "nightmare"
of her criminal case behind her and "reclaim my good life."
</P>
<P>
"My lawyers remain very confident in the strength of my appeal and
will continue to pursue it on my behalf," she said in her website
message.
</P>
<P>
"With your good wishes in my heart, I am looking forward to being
back at work in March, and to many brighter days ahead," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Alderson prison, which has around 1,050 inmates, sits in the
Allegheny Mountains, some 270 miles (430 kilometers) southwest of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The facility, which has no fences, has been dubbed "Camp Cupcake" by
inmates, although detainees are expected to adhere to a strict
regimen.
</P>
<P>
Stewart, whose net worth was estimated at nearly one billion dollars
before her stock-selling scandal, will be designated work paying a
maximum 40 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
The style diva will be permitted to wear a watch valued at 100
dollars or less and a pair of earrings of similar value.
</P>
<P>
The prison is no stranger to celebrity inmates, having housed the
likes of jazz singer Billie Holiday, the would-be assassin of
president Gerald Ford, Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme, and Kathryn Kelly,
the wife of gangster "Machine Gun" Kelly.
</P>
<P>
Some local residents have been taking advantage of the media circus
surrounding Stewart's internment, selling T-shirts with
tongue-in-cheek slogans like: "West Virginia. A Great Place to Spend
Time."
</P>
<P>
At her trial, prosecutors charged that Stewart was tipped off by her
broker Peter Bacanovic to sell her ImClone stock in late 2001, just
before a government announcement about an ImClone drug sent the share
price plummeting.
</P>
<P>
Stewart and Bacanovic had argued that they had a pre-existing
agreement to sell the stock if the price dropped below 60 dollars a
share.
</P>
<P>
After she is released from prison, Stewart will also have to undergo
five months of home confinement.

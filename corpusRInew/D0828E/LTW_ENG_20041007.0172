NEW YORK -- It's check-in day for Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
Stewart, 63, who rose from working-class roots in Nutley, N.J., to
be named one of the United States' 50 Most Powerful Women by Fortune
magazine in 1998, is expected to show up at the 105-acre, 1,040-inmate
Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia by 2 p.m. EDT Friday.
She will begin serving a 5-month sentence for lying to federal
investigators about her suspiciously timed stock sale.
</P>
<P>
Stewart, founder of a multimillion-dollar publishing and
home-decorating empire, spent Thursday with her mother, Martha
Kostyra, 90; daughter, Alexis, and sisters.
</P>
<P>
``She's in very good spirits,'' said a source who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Stewart was an apparent no-show Thursday night for the wedding
reception for Susan Magrino, her long time friend and publicist, at
the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
Guests said she didn't attend.
</P>
<P>
``Send her my love,'' writer Dominick Dunne said. ``I think the
punishment exceeded the crime here, and I will be praying for her.''
</P>
<P>
The source said Stewart has no fears about her safety at the
Alderson camp, the first federal prison for women in the country and
nicknamed Camp Cupcake because of its bakery.
</P>
<P>
``Alderson has a history of treating prisoners well,'' the source
said. ``I think she is mentally prepared. She's anxious to really
begin the closure. It was her decision to begin serving her term and
hers alone.''
</P>
<P>
Despite the prison's remote location -- nestled in the valley of
the Keeney, Muddy and Wolf creeks and the Flattop Appalachian
Mountains -- hordes of reporters and photographers have camped outside
its stone and iron gates in hopes of recording Stewart's grand entry.
</P>
<P>
Her anticipated arrival has also attracted some tourists. Karen and
Bill Bright of Buckhannon, W. Va., with cameras in hand, said they
detoured 11 miles to take in the show.
</P>
<P>
``We just wanted to see all the hoopla,'' said Bill Bright, 64.
</P>
<P>
Stewart will be issued four khaki work shirts, four khaki pants,
two T-shirts, seven pairs of underwear, one pair of work shoes, one
nightshirt, six pairs of socks and a coat.
</P>
<P>
Concerned about Stewart's confinement, the Save Martha Web site has
asked readers to send letters to Alderson's warden asking that Stewart
be allowed to ``share her talents with other inmates so that something
good can come out of this unfortunate situation.'' It also suggested
that readers send care packages of craft items, snacks and board games
``that could help her pass the time.''
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Stewart's appeal attorneys accused government
prosecutors Thursday of withholding evidence that could have led to an
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to federal prosecutors, the lawyers alleged that
documents and testimony of ink expert, Larry Stewart, showed the
government lab had ``sabotaged'' testing of a key piece of evidence.

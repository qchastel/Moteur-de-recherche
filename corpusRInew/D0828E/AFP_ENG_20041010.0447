US style guru Martha Stewart was friendly with inmates on her first
night in jail and appeared in "good spirits" as she began serving a
five-month prison sentence in West Virginia, US media reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Daily News said Stewart, wearing prison slacks, was
spotted Saturday taking a midday stroll by herself on the grounds of
the Alderson, West Virginia, federal prison. She also saw two
visitors, including her daughter Alexis.
</P>
<P>
Stewart reported to the jail on Friday to start a sentence for lying
about a dodgy stock sale.
</P>
<P>
"When she came in, she was in good spirits," a prison staffer told
the New York Daily News. "She was received professionally. She was
treated just like anybody else, just like any inmate would be. She's
in good hands. She'll be fine."
</P>
<P>
The Alderson prison, which has around 1,050 inmates, sits in the
Allegheny Mountains, some 270 miles (430 kilometers) southwest of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
An inmate who met the businesswoman on her first night told her
visiting aunt that Stewart was "very friendly and very cordial,"
according to the New York tabloid.
</P>
<P>
Another woman who visited an inmate said some prisoners are worried
the 63-year-old millionaire will get preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'It's going to be a riot up there if they treat her better
than they treat us,'" the visitor said, quoting the prisoner she was
visiting.
</P>
<P>
Stewart, 63, was convicted in March of obstructing justice and making
false statements to federal agents investigating her sale of nearly
4,000 shares in the biotechnology company ImClone Systems.

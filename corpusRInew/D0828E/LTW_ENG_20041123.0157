Domestic Diva Will Have a Turkey With Few Trimmings

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
There will be no sweet potato spoon bread this year
for Martha Stewart. No cornbread sourdough stuffing, no cranberry pear
chutney. Not for her the recipes touted on her company's Web site as
meals that will ``make you wish your plate were bigger.''
</P>
<P>
Instead, officials report that Stewart -- and her 1,050 fellow
inmates at West Virginia's Alderson Federal Prison Camp, where she is
serving time for lying about a stock sale -- can expect a more
traditional Thanksgiving meal. The turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy,
dressing and pumpkin pie will be prepared by inmates in the camp
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
Nobody is saying whether the jail birds will be frozen, or fresh,
as the nation's homemaker-in-chief might prefer. Prison officials
declined even to specify whether the turkeys will come from a local
farm, like the 44-pound bird pardoned last week at the White House by
President Bush. The turkey was a native of Mathias, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
A prison spokeswoman could promise only that they will be as cheap
as possible. ``They utilize the most cost-effective purchase
options,'' said spokeswoman Dawn Zobel, who explained that prison
officials regularly scan the Internet to find the least expensive
foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
Privacy rules prohibit Zobel from disclosing whether Stewart, 63,
will be helping to prepare the feast, and her spokespeople aren't
talking.
</P>
<P>
Thanksgiving Day comes on Day 48 of Stewart's five-month stay at
the sprawling minimum-security campus on the Greenbrier River. She
chose to begin serving her time even as her appeal wends its way
through the legal system.
</P>
<P>
The holiday is one of a sequence she will miss while on the inside,
including Halloween, Christmas and New Year's. In a Thanksgiving
message posted yesterday on www.marthatalks.com -- not
marthastewart.com, official Web site of Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia Inc. -- she told fans that she is ``safe, fit and healthy,''
though she acknowledged that ``the loss of freedom and the lack of
privacy are extremely difficult.''
</P>
<P>
Stewart said her ``daily interactions with the staff and fellow
inmates here at Alderson are marked by fair treatment and mutual
respect.'' She added that she is ``very grateful'' this Thanksgiving
for the support of her friends, family and colleagues, as well has
that of her fans who, she wrote, have sent more than 15,000 e-mails.
</P>
<P>
Stewart has always said she loves the holidays, which helped create
her media empire as millions of women tried out her seasonal recipes
and decorating tips in hopes of capturing the country elegance of a
Martha celebration.
</P>
<P>
Stewart stepped down as company chairman and chief executive after
her indictment last year. When she announced in September that she
would enter prison soon, Stewart noted specifically how ``very sad''
she would be to miss the holidays this year. ``They are always an
opportunity to celebrate family, friends and religious traditions that
mean so much to many of us,'' she said then.
</P>
<P>
In an interview last month with CNN's Larry King, her daughter,
Alexis Stewart, acknowledged that her mother loves the holidays and
that spending them in prison would be very hard. But she said a
``whole bunch of her family'' would travel to Alderson to celebrate
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
Although the prison generally allows only weekend visits, Stewart's
family can take advantage of special hours Thursday, from 8 a.m. to
3:30 p.m. Inmates, who all are required to hold a prison job, get the
day off, with the exception of those who work in the powerhouse and,
of course, the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
The domestic diva's family shouldn't count on eating with Stewart,
however. In years past, Thanksgiving was the one day of the year when
inmates' families were allowed past visiting rooms and into the heart
of the camp where, for $1.75, they could share in the feast.
</P>
<P>
Not this year. Zobel said the decision to limit the meal to inmates
was a ``procedural change'' announced in August by the camp's new
warden and was driven partly by budgetary concerns.

<P>
Instead, Stewart's relatives could attend some of the seasonal
events that kick off this week in Alderson, a town of 1,100 that has
been home to the nation's oldest federal prison for women since it
opened in 1927. This weekend, several galleries and stores on Railroad
Avenue will host their annual open houses. Patti Grafton at the Wolf
Creek Gallery will serve mulled cider.
</P>
<P>
In December, the town will host its annual Christmas celebration,
throwing open the doors to decorated old mansions for tours. The
Singing Angels, a gospel choir made up of Alderson inmates, will
perform at the Presbyterian church.
</P>
<P>
Among the things the town is thankful for this year is Stewart,
whom they have adopted since she slipped through the gates of the
prison down the road before dawn Oct.8. Though the prison has hosted
famous inmates before, none seem to have elicited quite as much
interest as Stewart, who has brought with her a seemingly endless
stream of reporters and tourists to shop in the stores and eat in the
town's two restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Betty Alderson, who is married to a descendant of the town's
founder and owns the 117-year-old Alderson Store, just keeps selling
her Martha-themed T-shirts. The orders come in practically every day,
from across the country -- more than 800 so far. The sales, she said,
will make this a nice Thanksgiving indeed for her family.
</P>
<P>
``We're in rural West Virginia. We don't have a lot going on, and
things are mighty slow,'' she said. ``We have a lot of bills to pay.
It's been good to have to that extra padding there to help us out.''

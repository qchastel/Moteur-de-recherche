Fans trek to prison to say goodbye to Martha Stewart

After undergoing chemotherapy in Tacoma, Washington, Kathy Herrmann flew across
the United States to see Martha Stewart as she left a federal prison in West
Virginia early Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired but it meant enough for me to come out here anyway," Herrmann said,
who had her chemotherapy treatment on Wednesday. "It's all about
support."
</P>
<P>
Herrmann and several friends stood at the Greenbrier Valley airport in minus 9
Celsius (16 Farenheit) weather holding a Martha Stewart-brand floral print sheet
with signatures from Seattle area fans.
</P>
<P>
The cross-country trip was not their first to support the homemaking queen. Last
year, Herrmann and others attended Stewart's trial in federal court in
Manhattan. That ended with Stewart begin convicted on charges of lying about a
2001 stock sale.
</P>
<P>
As part of her sentence, Stewart was ordered to serve five months at the federal
women's camp in Alderson. The prison term ended at 12:30 a.m. (0530GMT) Friday
when she was released. Stewart boarded a private jet for the flight to New York,
where she must spend five months of home confinement at her 153-acre
(62-hectare) estate.
</P>
<P>
"She's been a blessing to the prison and a blessing to the girls there," said
Hattie Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
The former prison minister is used to high-profile inmates at the
minimum-security prison, but "it wasn't as exciting as" Stewart's stay and
departure.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in the crowd was a fan. Some came to experience the
moment.
</P>
<P>
"I came down just because it's history. I'm definitely not a fan," said Lisa
Huff of Bluefield, Virginia. Huff was talking to a friend earlier in the evening
when she decided to make the 64-mile (100-kilometer) trip to
Alderson.
</P>
<P>
"When she went in, I thought she was mean. But when she decided to go to jail,
now she looks more contrite," Huff said. "I think jail has been great for
her."
</P>
<P>
One of the tasks ahead of Stewart is to try and spin the goodwill she gained in
prison into profits for her Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. Despite high
stock prices, the company has posted a loss last year.
</P>
<P>
But William Parr, 66, of Amherst, Virginia, said Stewart will rebound because
she has the "Midas touch."
</P>
<P>
"I love this lady. I've followed her for the last 20 years," said Parr, who
drove about 100 miles (160 kilometers) to see Stewart. "She has definitely got
her act together on the home front."

<P>
Martha Stewart, in a Christmas message posted on her personal Web
site, called for sentencing reform and took a swipe at the "bad food"
in prison.
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who is roughly halfway through a five-month sentence for
lying about a stock sale, urged fans to think about the women she has
met in prison who are "devoid of care, devoid of love, devoid of
family."
</P>
<P>
She suggested Americans should push for reforms in federal sentencing
guidelines for nonviolent first-time offenders and particularly for
drug offenders, who she said would be better served by rehabilitation
than prison.
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who built a billion-dollar empire in homemaking, reported
that her job at the federal prison camp in Alderson, West Virginia,
has been cleaning, including sweeping, vacuuming and raking leaves.
</P>
<P>
"I have had time to think, time to write, time to exercise, time to
not eat the bad food, and time to walk and contemplate the future,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia,
announced Stewart would host a daytime talk show with a live studio
audience beginning this fall.
</P>
<P>
The company has been working with reality TV pioneer Mark Burnett,
and shares of the media company have soared since Stewart reported to
prison _ although they have fallen back somewhat in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Stewart is due to be released in early March from prison, then must
spend five months confined to her home in Bedford. The television
show is scheduled to air after the five months of house arrest end.
</P>
<P>
Stewart and her former stockbroker, Peter Bacanovic, were convicted
in March of lying about why Stewart unloaded shares of ImClone
Systems Inc. stock in 2001, just before the price plunged. Both are
appealing.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Stewart filed new papers Wednesday with the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, urging it to overturn her conviction. The
appeals court is expected to hear the case early in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The new papers, like Stewart's previous arguments, argue that
prosecutors improperly implied she was accused of insider trading and
that a government expert witness on ink analysis lied on the stand.

<P>
Liberia's former president Charles Taylor, accused of fomenting bloody wars
across West Africa, at last faces judgment for some of the mayhem wrought during
his years in power.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, taken from exile in Nigeria and presented handcuffed on Wednesday to the
U.N.-backed tribunal in Sierra Leone, is charged with 17 counts of crimes
against humanity stemming from a brutal rebellion that left many thousands dead
or maimed.
</P>
<P>
His capture and imprisonment seem to bring his bloodstained 16-year odyssey to a
close and avert a feared renewal of conflict in Liberia, had he returned there.
Instead, he becomes the first African head of state to face an international war
crimes tribunal _ another step in growing efforts to make leaders accountable
for their actions.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's 1989 insurgency in Liberia _ which eventually killed 200,000 _ helped
tilt the region into crisis. His rise and fall reflect the painful struggles of
West Africa, now working toward peace.
</P>
<P>
"Taylor for me is a ruthless dictator whose capture and subsequent trial should
be welcome for all Liberian people. The mayhem and destruction he brought has to
be accounted for. No more delay," said Romeo Snehtie, a 39-year old student in
Liberia. "We will remember him as a leader who was strong but who did not use
his might for the improvement for the Liberian people."
</P>
<P>
Liberia, once among the richer countries in West Africa, is now among its
poorest. The shattered capital, Monrovia, has not had government-supplied
electricity, water or sewerage for over a decade.
</P>
<P>
Long years of crisis that ended with Taylor's flight to Nigerian exile in 2003
has left the country all-but a failed state, with 15,000 U.N. peacekeepers
providing security for the new administration of President Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf, whose inauguration this year ended a postwar transitional
administration.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's 1989 incursion from Ivory Coast had spread chaos across Liberia and
into Sierra Leone, whose brutal rebels fought a 1991-2002 civil war. Taylor
helped pioneer the use of child soldiers, often kidnapped from their parents and
drugged. His fighters still are believed to roam Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia
and Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond the vast damage he has personally inflicted on West Africa, Charles
Taylor embodies the misrule and warlord politics that have devastated the
region," said Eric Witte, formerly a political adviser at the Sierra Leone court
and now a senior associate at the Democratization Policy Council in
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
"His arrest is a watershed for West Africa, as it not only prevents Taylor from
future troublemaking, but may signal a new international approach to the region
_ one built on the principle of accountability."
</P>
<P>
Taylor was born into a family of so-called Americo-Liberians, descendants of the
freed American slaves that founded Africa's first republic in 1847 and ruled as
elites for over a century.
</P>
<P>
Taylor lived in the Boston area of the northeast United States during the 1970s,
earning an economics degree from Bentley College in Waltham,
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
He later joined the government of President Samuel Doe, an illiterate mid-level
officer who took over the government in 1980, ordering the execution of 13
ministers who were tied to poles on a beach and machine-gunned. Sirleaf, then a
minister herself, barely escaped and fled overseas.
</P>
<P>
Taylor fled after he was accused in 1983 of embezzling nearly a million dollars.
He went to the United States, where he was detained on a Liberian arrest
warrant. But he escaped from a Massachusetts jail in 1985 _ cutting through bars
with a hacksaw and climbing down a knotted sheet _ to launch the civil war that
ousted Doe.
</P>
<P>
Taylor won elections in 1997, beating Sirleaf by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
But many ex-allies took up arms against him in 2000 and attacked Monrovia in
2003. Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo helped broker peace in Liberia by
offering Taylor exile in Nigeria, which he accepted and stepped
down.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said he would hand Taylor to Liberia if a democratically elected leader
requested it. After Sirleaf gave the nod, he made good on his word
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I think his capture and being put on trial does not only close a chapter but it
also sends a powerful message to the region that impunity will not be allowed to
stand and would-be warlords will pay a price," said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said at U.N. headquarters in New York.

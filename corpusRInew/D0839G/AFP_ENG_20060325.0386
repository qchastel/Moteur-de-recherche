The international pressure group 
Human Rights Watch on Saturday called on Nigeria to move quickly to 
make good its promise to surrender exiled former Liberian leader 
Charles Taylor to his home government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo had said in a 
statement that Nigeria would honour a request from Liberia that the 
former president and war crimes suspect be handed over, but did not 
say when this would happen.
</P>
<P>
"We call for urgent steps to tighten security around his villa 
in Calabar and for him to be immediately taken into custody," said 
Elise Keppler, counsel to Human Rights Watch's international justice 
programme, in an email.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has been living in a luxury riverside villa in the 
southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar since August 2003, when 
Obasanjo persuaded him to step down as president of Liberia and 
allow a 14-year civil war to come to an end.
</P>
<P>
When an AFP reporter visited the former warlord in his home on 
Tuesday there was no sign of any Nigerian security personnel on the 
approach road.

<P>
Taylor's black Jaguar saloon car has tinted windows and 
diplomatic plates and he appears to be able to drive in and out of 
his compound at will. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberian leader greeted journalists, but was not allowed to 
talk to the press or make political statements. He was equipped, 
however, with a battery of mobile telephones and held meetings with 
a stream of Liberian visitors.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the Nigerian government's announcement that Taylor 
will be handed over to Liberia.  This is a tremendous moment for the 
people of Sierra Leone, Liberia, and all West Africa," Keppler 
said.
</P>
<P>
"Taylor can now face trial at the war crimes court in Sierra 
Leone where he is indicted on 17 counts of war crimes and crimes 
against humanity for his role in the armed conflict there," she 
added.
</P>
<P>
"The victims of the widespread murder and mayhem associated with 
Taylor will finally have the chance to see justice done," she said.

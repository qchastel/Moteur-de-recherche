adviser

Liberia's exiled former 
leader Charles Taylor expressed concern Wednesday that his country 
may fall back into chaos if he is extradited from Nigeria to face 
war crimes charges, his spiritual adviser said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor met Wednesday with the renowned Indian evangelist Kilari 
Anand Paul in the eastern city of Calabar an AFP correspondent saw 
-- as pressure rose on Nigeria to extradite him to face war crimes 
charges.
</P>
<P>
Paul told journalists after meeting Taylor: "He said 'there will 
be tremendous destabilisation in Liberia if the extradition takes 
place'."
</P>
<P>
"There is no question in my mind that there will be chaos," 
added Paul.
</P>
<P>
The evangelist said he had spoken to "nine of Taylor's top 10 
generals" and that he feared that Taylor could have sufficient 
support in Liberia so that his extradition and prosecution for 
warcrimes could provoke violent unrest.
</P>
<P>
Paul met Taylor in 2003 and was one of those who worked to 
persuade the Librian leader of the necessity for him to stand down 
and accept exile in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the New York Times following Taylor's 
resignation, the warlord said the Indian preacher's intervention had 
been a decisive factor in his decision.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the asylum deal which brought Taylor to 
Nigeria in August 2003, the former president is forbidden from 
giving interviews to the media.
</P>
<P>
However, he exchanged greetings with an AFP reporter and other 
journalists who had been invited to his luxury Calabar villa by his 
guru Paul.
</P>
<P>
Since 2003, when an advancing rebel army forced him to flee 
Monrovia, Taylor has lived as a guest of Nigeria's President 
Olusegun Obasanjo in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo invited Taylor to Nigeria in order to bring an end to a 
14-year-civil war which pitched the guerrilla chief turned elected 
ruler against two powerful rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's move won widespread international support, but 
Obasanjo has since come under increasing international pressure to 
allow Taylor to be tried for alleged crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Liberia's newly elected President Ellen 
Johnson-Sirleaf confirmed that she had asked Obasanjo to send Taylor 
home. Officials in Monrovia said he would be sent to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Many Liberians however themselves are fearful that Taylor's 
return might respark conflict in the fragile west African state.

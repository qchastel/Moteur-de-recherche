NIGERIA WILL END ASYLUM FOR DEPOSED LIBERIAN RULER

<P>
Nigeria said Saturday that it would end the
asylum of deposed Liberian dictator Charles G. Taylor and hand
him over to the Liberian government for trial.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a warlord-turned-president who presided over a country shattered by civil
war, was indicted by the U.N.-backed Special Court in Sierra
Leone in 2003 for war crimes and crimes against humanity
in neighboring Sierra Leone during that country's decade-long insurgency.
</P>
<P>
But the court has been unable to arrest Taylor, who left
Liberia as rebels narrowed in on him in 2003. Instead,
he went into exile in Nigeria, where authorities agreed in
an internationally-brokered deal to grant him safe haven in order
to end 14 years of civil war in Liberia. "God
willing, I will be back," the flamboyant Taylor said he
as bid farewell to his country.
</P>
<P>
Since agreeing to accept Taylor, the Nigerian government has rebuffed numerous
attempts to put him on trial before the international court,
saying it would violate the agreement. But Liberia's newly elected
president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, raised the issue earlier this month
with President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, describing it as an
important part of bringing stability to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"Liberia's peace is fragile," Johnson Sirleaf said during a news conference
this month in New York after announcing her extradition request
to the U.N. Security Council. "There are many loyalists in
our country to Mr. Taylor."
</P>
<P>
"We inherited a problem," she added. "We are a small country,
we have no powers that others have, we have no
security forces to protect our people and the safety of
our nation, so we are caught in a situation that
we have to take a major decision that should have
been taken long before."
</P>
<P>
Even so, she said that she wanted to ensure that in
any proceedings, there is an environment that protects the human
rights of all, including those of the accused.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by Obasanjo's office on Saturday, the president
said Liberia was free to take Taylor into custody. Although
he is not under indictment in Liberia, U.N. peacekeepers there
have been authorized by the Security Council to transfer him
to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
No precise date for the transfer was indicated, but Obasanjo said
he had never been against surrendering Taylor to a democratically
elected government in Liberia. Johnson Sirleaf was sworn in as
Liberia's president in January, becoming Africa's first woman to be
elected head of state.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Obasanjo, the past president of the African Union,
said that before he agreed to hand over Taylor he
consulted the current leader of the continent-wide body, President Denis
Sassou Nguesso of Congo Republic, as well as the head
of ECOWAS, a regional trade group.
</P>
<P>
Taylor was forbidden from leaving Nigeria during his exile, but he
continued to meddle in his former country's affairs from his
government guest house in Calabar, on Nigeria's southern coast, using
some of the millions of dollars he is accused of
stealing from Liberia's coffers.
</P>
<P>
The court, set up in 2000, had issued an arrest warrant
for Taylor on 17 counts in 2003 but Nigeria ignored
it. Obasanjo had said that he might consider a similar
request by Liberia's government, but until this year the country
only had transitional leaders.
</P>
<P>
With the backing of Libya and other regional powers, Taylor unleashed
a cycle of war that gripped Liberia and much of
West Africa during the 1990s. In Sierra Leone, he is
accused of training and arming Sierra Leone's rebels, many of
whom were children. That bloody conflict left tens of thousands
of people dead and thousands more maimed by soldiers who
hacked off civilians' limbs. The war in Liberia was similarly
vicious, with Taylor's rebel forces known for their ferocity.

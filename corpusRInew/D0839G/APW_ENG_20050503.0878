Spokesman: Liberia's Taylor not involved in attack against Guinea president

<P>
Exiled former Liberian President Charles Taylor was not behind a failed January
assassination attempt against Guinea President Lansana Conte, his spokesman said
Tuesday, dismissing allegations by prosecutors for Sierra Leone's U.N.-backed
war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
In Guinea, Yaya Camara, the top aid to the security minister, said his
government had no proof that Taylor organized the Jan. 19 attack and that the
investigation was ongoing.
</P>
<P>
Allison Cooper, a spokeswoman for the special court, accused Taylor of plotting
the assassination attempt, warning Monday it would "soon be repeated."
</P>
<P>
"Taylor didn't do any of those things alleged," his spokesman, Vaanii Paasawe,
said from the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar, where the ex-warlord-turned
president lives in exile.
</P>
<P>
Camara said from Guinea's capital, Conakry: "We don't know yet who tried to
assassinate Guinea's president. A lot has been said about this affair since the
beginning, but it's important to say that the investigation is still going
on."
</P>
<P>
Camara said his government had had no contact with the Freetown-based court
since the assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Taylor gave up the presidency and fled to Nigeria in August 2003, part of a
peace deal brokered as rebels besieged the Liberian capital,
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Taylor was later indicted by the war-crimes tribunal for backing Sierra Leone
rebels in a vicious 10-year insurgency in the diamond-rich nation.
</P>
<P>
Cooper, the war crimes court spokeswoman, said Monday that Taylor "remains in
contact with his political network in Liberia on a day-to-day basis," adding
that he'll "remain a menace to West Africa until he is turned over for trial to
the special court for Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has repeatedly rejected demands to surrender Taylor to the Freetown
court to face war crimes charges, arguing it offered Taylor exile to end
Liberia's war and bring peace to the region.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has ordered Taylor to keep a low profile and not meddle in the affairs
of Liberia or any other nation.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo's spokeswoman, Remi Oyo, told The
Associated Press her government had "no evidence that Taylor is breaching the
terms of his stay in Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
Cooper said Taylor ordered the attempt on Conte's life to punish him for
supporting rebels of the now-defunct Liberians United for Reconciliation and
Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Guinea was widely believed to have supported Liberian rebels during the war, and
New York-based Human Rights Watch accused Guinea of violating a U.N. arms
embargo on Liberia to supply weapons to rebels there. The government has denied
the accusations.
</P>
<P>
Camara said Guinea "has nothing which says that it was he (Taylor) who fomented
the attempted assassination. What we know is that Mr. Taylor went to Burkina
Faso and that a Burkina Faso military plane went to Nigeria to take him to
Burkina Faso. But what he did after that, we don't know." He gave no other
details.
</P>
<P>
In March, U.S. Rep. Sue Kelly, a Republican from New York, alleged that Taylor
had traveled to Burkina Faso to meet with Islamist groups and paid for the
assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Conte has ruled Guinea since a 1984 military coup. The ailing leader suffers
from a severe stomach ulcer and diabetes, and many fear violence and a power
struggle may follow his death.
</P>
<P>
"Guinea is a powder keg with its own political problems. It can implode at any
time and it won't be necessarily because Taylor is interfering," said Paasawe.
"Taylor is not in a position to do that."
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's insurgency _ launched by rebels seeking control of Sierra Leone's
government and diamond fields _ ended by 2002, thanks largely to forceful
military intervention by Britain and that of Guinea, which borders Sierra
Leone.

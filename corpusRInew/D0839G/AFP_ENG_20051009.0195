MONROVIA, Oct 9
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though he has been gone from Liberia for 
over two years, Charles Taylor's presence still hangs over the west 
African country ravaged by his greedy and murderous rule, amid 
mounting global calls for his extradition to face trial on war 
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Presidential candidates lining up for the October 11 elections 
have moved either to distance or align themselves with the warlord 
turned president, depending on their constituencies, while former 
allies including his ex-wife Jewel Howard Taylor are making their 
own bids for legislative seats. 
</P>
<P>
Front-runner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has had to publicly apologize 
for a 1990s-era comment that supported his siege of Monrovia in the 
quest to overturn Samuel Doe, and her loyalties have been regularly 
called into question by opponents who say she funded his rebellion, 
a charge she has vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
Roland Massaquoi, the standard bearer for Taylor's National 
Patriotic Party, says if he wants to get in touch with Taylor in his 
luxurious exile in southern Nigeria he can at any time, but, he 
stressed, "he listens to us; I don't have to listen to him".
</P>
<P>
Within Liberia, however, there is less support than abroad for 
Taylor's extradition to next-door Sierra Leone to face a 17-count 
indictment for having armed and trained the rebel Revolutionary 
United Front in its decade of civil conflict considered among the 
most brutal wars in modern history.
</P>
<P>
Only Charles Brumskine, a businessman who served briefly as 
senator under Taylor, has made Taylor's handover to the UN-backed 
court a campaign promise.
</P>
<P>
Others, including Johnson Sirleaf and Massaquoi, have suggested 
a need for further evidence to be presented by the court and say the 
priority should be recuperating the billions of dollars allegedly 
siphoned off by the former president.
</P>
<P>
The tepid response to the Taylor issue at home has not mitigated 
bellicose action from within the international community with 
respect to the indictment at the Freetown court and his extradition 
from Nigeria, should evidence be presented to suggest that he has 
been meddling in Liberia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's transitional government, along with its neighbors in 
the Mano River Union, Sierra Leone and Guinea, in July suggested 
that "there may now be a need for a review of the terms of the 
temporary stay granted Taylor (in Nigeria)"
</P>
<P>
The United States last week circulated a draft resolution at the 
United Nations to boost the mandate of the 15,000-strong UN mission 
to allow for peacekeepers to arrest Taylor should he return to 
Liberia and bring him to trial.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was in Monrovia on 
Friday for a day-long visit, his first since accompanying Taylor 
into exile in August 2003 to end the civil war, has resisted all 
calls for his handover to Freetown, saying he will only offer up his 
unwelcome guest to an elected Liberian government.
</P>
<P>
"If Taylor is to be turned over to a court it is vitally 
important to demonstrate that he has broken the terms of his 
agreement," Brussels-based thinktank Crisis Group wrote in its 
September 7 report.
</P>
<P>
"Shortly after inauguration, the new Liberian president should 
call for a meeting of (west African) heads of state to take a 
collective decision as to whether Taylor has breached the terms of 
his stay in Nigeria... to justify terminating his asylum."

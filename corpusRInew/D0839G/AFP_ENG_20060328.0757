<P>
UN chief Kofi Annan on 
Tuesday appealed to West African countries to arrest and deny refuge 
to Liberia's former leader and war crimes suspect Charles Taylor, 
who has disappeared from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Taylor is accused by a UN-backed war crimes court in Sierra 
Leone of masterminding a policy of murder, torture, pillage and rape 
in Liberia and Sierra Leone, where prosecutors have lodged a 
17-count indictment alleging crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Annan's office late Tuesday issued a statement saying the UN 
chief "calls on all countries in the region not to give refuge to 
Mr. Taylor, but to execute the warrant for his arrest."
</P>
<P>
The statement also urged those countries to comply with Liberian 
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's request that Taylor be transferred 
to the Special Court in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday Annan told reporters that, if confirmed, 
Taylor's disappearance would be "extremely worrying."
</P>
<P>
Taylor had been living in exile in southeastern Nigeria until 
Monday night, when he was found to have left his luxury villa, only 
two days after Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said the 
government of Liberia "could take him into custody".
</P>
<P>
"I have heard the news. We are trying to get more facts about 
it," Annan told reporters. "It would be extremely worrying if indeed 
he had disappeared."
</P>
<P>
The UN secretary general said he was trying to talk to Nigerian 
authorities about the case.
</P>
<P>
In August 2003, in a bid to bring an end to a brutal civil war, 
Obasanjo invited Taylor to step down as president, leave his 
besieged capital, Monrovia, and accept political asylum in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
International prosecutors and human rights advocates had warned 
that if Taylor was able to escape extradition to a the war crimes 
court in Sierra Leone, he might once again endanger the stability of 
West Africa.

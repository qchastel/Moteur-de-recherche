The west African regional bloc 
ECOWAS praised Nigeria's arrest of fugitive warlord Charles Taylor 
on Wednesday and thanked its most powerful member for its role in 
hosting him in exile.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Economic Community of West African States 
said members had received "with relief" the news that Taylor had 
been detained while trying to flee Nigeria, his home for 30 months, 
for Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
"ECOWAS wishes to use this opportunity to renew its appreciation 
to the government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for 
accepting Charles Taylor during a difficult period in the Liberian 
peace process," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The action helped end the carnage in the country, thereby 
creating a conducive environment for the successful conduct of 
elections and restoration of democratic governance, which had eluded 
Liberia over the years," it said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria took in Taylor in August 2003 after African leaders 
persuaded him to stand down as president of Liberia in order to 
bring an end to a 14-year-old civil war which had killed hundreds of 
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
But Obasanjo had since come under pressure from the 
international community to surrender Taylor to face charges of 
crimes against humanity at a UN-backed tribunal in Liberia's equally 
war-torn neighbour Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Obasanjo relented and said he would send Taylor 
home, allowing Liberia to extradite him to Sierra Leone if it so 
wished. The former warlord promptly absconded but was picked up 
Wednesday trying to flee the country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has now deported him to Monrovia, where he is expected 
to be arrested by UN peacekeepers and transferred to Sierra Leone.

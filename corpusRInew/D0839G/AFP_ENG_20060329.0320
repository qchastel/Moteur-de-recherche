The United Nations peacekeeping 
force in Liberia (UNMIL) is ready to arrest and transfer to Freetown 
war crimes suspect Charles Taylor, who left Nigeria Wednesday, a 
UNMIL spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a mandate under the (UN) Security Council resolution 
1638 to apprehend, detain and transfer him to the Special Court in 
Sierra Leone," said spokesman Paul Egunsola.
</P>
<P>
"If he should come to Liberia UNMIL is ready to implement the 
mandate that has been given to it by the Security Council," Egunsola 
told a news conference moments before Taylor was airlifted from a 
northeastern Nigerian town of Maiduguri.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, according to Information 
Minister Frank Nweke, "ordered the immediate repatriation of Charles 
Taylor to Liberia" shortly after he was caught trying to cross the 
border from his asylum home into neighbouring Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
After his capture, the fugitive warlord was detained under armed 
guard Wednesday in a military camp before being put on a 
presidential jet bound for Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member UN Security Council in November unanimously 
adopted a resolution permitting the 17,000-strong UN force in 
Liberia to arrest Taylor in the event that he returns home.
</P>
<P>
UNMIL should apprehend, detain and transfer Taylor to Freetown 
to face prosecution before the special war crimes court, the 
Security Council mandated.
</P>
<P>
Taylor faces a 17-count indictment for having armed and trained 
Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front, sustaining a 
decade-long civil conflict, one of the most brutal in modern 
history.
</P>
<P>
He left Liberia for Nigeria in August 2003 after stepping down 
as president, part of a peace deal ending the second of two civil 
wars that had ravaged Liberia since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Asked what measures UNMIL has taken to ensure Liberia's 
stability amid reports of discontent among the former warlord's 
allies over Taylor imminent return, Egunsola said the force was well 
equipped and ready to handle any problem that might arise.
</P>
<P>
"Let me assure you that UNMIL is ready and is prepared to deal 
with any situation," he said, adding that the force would "react 
robustly."
</P>
<P>
Security authorities in Monrovia have in recent days picked up 
several of Taylor's associates for questioning over alleged plots to 
create mayhem if Taylor were brought back from Nigeria.

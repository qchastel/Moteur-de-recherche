<P>
A close ally of former Liberian 
leader Charles Taylor Tuesday charged Tuesday that President Ellen 
Johnson Sirleaf knows the whereabouts of the war crimes suspect who 
went missing from his exile home in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"Ellen knows where Taylor is especially after... Nigeria has 
said that her government could come and take the former president," 
said Sando Johnson, one of several Taylor associates recently 
arrested and freed in Monrovia on charges of planning to stir up 
violence.
</P>
<P>
"Ellen has created a problem for Liberia. Ellen has declared war 
on Liberia by unilaterally asking Nigeria to turn over former 
President Taylor," he told AFP in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's disappearance came just 48 hours after Nigerian 
President Olusegun Obasanjo had announced that Liberia was free to 
"take Taylor into custody" and human rights activists were quick to 
condemn what they said may be a bid to escape international 
justice.
</P>
<P>
A former senator during Taylor's reign and an active member of 
the former ruling National Patriotic Party (NPP), Sando said "as a 
result of this, Liberia is not safe."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had an idea of where Taylor could be Johnson said "I 
do not know where he is."
</P>
<P>
Presidential press secretary Charles Nelson said the government 
does not have "any final position on this matter".
</P>
<P>
Sirleaf is expected to address the tiny west African nation 
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's estranged wife Jewel Howard Taylor told Liberia's Star 
radio, sponsored by a Swiss non-governmental organisation, that her 
former husband could be still in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know what the situation is. But I do not think he will 
run away. Charles Taylor is not a person who runs away. So I do not 
think it is possible," said the former first lady of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Howard Taylor, has warned that trying Taylor for war crimes 
would open a pandora's box.
</P>
<P>
"It is not just one person that is responsible for the war," she 
said.
</P>
<P>
"If we are talking about freedom and justice and if they want to 
punish people then every one has to be punished from the beginning 
to the end.
</P>
<P>
"And if we want to pardon every one then we should pardon every 
one across the board," she said  adding that the recently 
established truth and reconciliation commission should be allowed to 
conduct its probe "and find out what the real story is and then we 
can move forward."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liberia former caretaker president Moses Blah threw 
his weight behind Taylor's demands to be tried outside Sierra Leone, 
where the former warlord is accused of sponsoring rebels in a brutal 
war against President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Blah who ran the country for just two months after Taylor went 
into exile in 2003, said Sierra Leone was not a "neutral" ground to 
try the former head of state.
</P>
<P>
"Sierra Leone is accusing Taylor. You can not turn yourself in 
to the accuser. He is supposed to be tried on neutral ground.
</P>
<P>
"Taylor could go anywhere in the world to be tried other than 
Freetown," said Blah.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's escape was condemned by the chief prosecutor of the 
UN-backed war crimes tribunal in Sierra Leone, who has accused the 
warlord of overseeing the massacre, torture, rape and enslavement of 
thousands of civilians.

Church bombings scaring away Christians from Sunday service; many
prefer to leave country
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in their lives, Widad Mikho and her sister Neshwan
will not attend Mass on Sunday, too frightened after a series of
church bombings across Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
But fear will not keep Dana George away. "It would be better to die
in church than anywhere else," she said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Christians, increasingly targeted by insurgents, are fleeing
Baghdad for the safety of the Kurdish north or neighboring Syria and
Jordan. After Saturday's bombings of five churches _ which damaged
buildings but caused no casualties _ Christian leaders fear more will
leave.
</P>
<P>
But the exodus is temporary, insist many, because they are not
selling their homes and property. They will wait it out and return
when the situation improves.
</P>
<P>
Pascale Isho Warda, a Christian who is the interim government's
minister for displacement and migration, estimated as many as 15,000
out of Iraq's nearly 1 million Christians have left the country since
August, when four churches in Baghdad and one in Mosul were blown up
in a coordinated series of car bombings.
</P>
<P>
The attacks killed 12 people and injured 61 others. Another church
was bombed in Baghdad in September.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's "explosions will no doubt push people to immigrate," said
Father Raphael Qutaimi, acting bishop of the Syrian Catholic Church.
"But this country has been ours for thousands of years. Our ancestors
shed blood defending it. We mustn't leave it."
</P>
<P>
He and all the dozen Christians interviewed Saturday said the attacks
were not the work of Muslim Iraqis, but foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"The foreigner is trying to create division and enmity between
Christians and Muslims. We must stand hand in hand and heart to heart
and not give the outsider cause to divide us," Qutaimi said.
</P>
<P>
"They want us to leave Iraq," said Surah Samaan, a 25-year-old lab
technician, referring to the attackers, who she believes are Arabs
linked to al-Qaida.
</P>
<P>
But Yonadem Kana, secretary general of the Assyrian Democratic
Movement, said the general security situation of the country _ car
bombings, kidnappings and murders, which affect all of Iraq's
religious groups _ had chased away many Christians.
</P>
<P>
"They figure instead of staying and paying $50,000 (euro40,275) to
kidnappers for ransom, they can spend $5,000 (euro4,025) in Latakia
or Damascus," he said, referring to two cities in neighboring Syria.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 100 Christians had been murdered after the U.S.-led
war, including 35 liquor vendors and others who worked for coalition
forces. About 200 more have died in the general violence that has
gripped Iraq. Insurgents have been targeting many Iraqis who are seen
as helping the U.S.-led forces, and extremist militiamen have often
targeted people in occupations seen as breaking Islamic rules.
</P>
<P>
Never in Iraq, Kana said, had a church been attacked, not since the
days of the Mongols, who massacred 800,000 of Baghdad's residents and
destroyed the city in the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
Neshwan Mikho, 46, has been cleaning the Saint John's Church in the
working class neighborhood of Bataween every Saturday for the past
seven years undeterred by rain, sandstorms or even shellings. "But
today, I was afraid to go when I heard the news," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said she and her sister, Widad, 60, who lives with her, will not
catch the 6:30 a.m. bus that takes them to church every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I am sad in my heart because tomorrow I will not be attending Mass,"
said Widad, a Chaldean Christian. "They are denying us what is most
important thing in our lives."
</P>
<P>
She has been living in a state of near paranoia since the August
church attacks. At night, she said, she wakes up four or five times
to look out the window to make sure no one's standing outside.
</P>
<P>
"We are targets from both sides _ for being Iraqis like everyone else
and for being Christians in particular," said Widad, a retired nurse.
</P>
<P>
She and her sister would like to leave for good for Australia, where
their two other sisters live. But they cannot afford it.
</P>
<P>
"What can we do? They are shelling our church, they might break into
our homes tomorrow and the next day force us to wear the veil," Widad
said.
</P>
<P>
Bassem Samir Khouri, a legal adviser in the interim Education
Ministry, will also skip Sunday mass but is staying put in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said throughout the years, Iraq's Christians had kept to
themselves trying to keep out of trouble. With the country in turmoil
now, Muslims are asking why the Christians aren't taking sides on the
question of Fallujah or other trouble spots where anti-American
insurgency is strong.
</P>
<P>
Dana George, 60, would like to leave the country _ if only for the
sake of her three grown children. But her husband won't hear of it.
So for now, she will continue going to her St. Matthew's Church
despite the attacks.
</P>
<P>
She feels indebted to God for protecting her and her family all those
difficult years under Saddam. "Now I feel it's my duty to pay him
back," she said.
</P>
<P>
Samaan said Christians are vulnerable in predominantly Muslim Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody to help us. Muslims have the support of their tribe.
The Pope is our only power, but doesn't help us," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said she would like to leave Iraq for good.
</P>
<P>
Where would she like to go?
</P>
<P>
"Anywhere _ out of the Arab world _ where they all think we are
infidels," she said.

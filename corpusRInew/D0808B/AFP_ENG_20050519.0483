<P>
The patriarch of the Iraq-based Chaldean 
Church, Emmanuel Delly, said Thursday that Iraq's future 
constitution should not solely be based on the Koran, despite the 
country's overwhelming Muslim majority.
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-five percent of the Iraqi people are Muslims. The 
government should be Islamic but the Koran cannot be the sole source 
for the constitution," Delly told a press conference in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's small Christian community represents only about three 
percent of the country's population. With 600,000 followers, the 
Chaldean Church accounts for the vast majority of Iraq's 
Christians.
</P>
<P>
Delly said he had discussed Iraq's future constitution with the 
most influential Shiite cleric in the country, Grand Ayatollah Ali 
Sistani.
</P>
<P>
The Chaldean patriarch said Sistani had told him he "did not 
want a government that was only for Shiites or Muslims in general", 
adding that new Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari "says the same 
thing".
</P>
<P>
Jaafari pledged Sunday to get more Sunnis involved in drafting 
the constitution after meeting with US Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice during her surprise visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's parliament has just set up a committee to draft the 
constitution by a deadline of August 15.
</P>
<P>
The draft is then to be put to a nationwide referendum by 
October 15 under a deadline set by the US-inspired transitional 
administrative law (TAL) currently governing Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The constitution must "offer religious freedom to all in Iraq, 
but also personal liberties," Delly said.
</P>
<P>
Delly, who has been in France for the past week, met with French 
President Jacques Chirac on Monday. He was to celebrate a mass with 
the Archbishop of Paris, Andre Vingt-Trois, on Sunday before leaving 
the country.

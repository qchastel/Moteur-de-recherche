IRAQI CHRISTIANS HAVE BABA NOEL, JINGLE BELLS, HOPES TO FLEE
</HEADLINE>

BAGHDAD, Iraq
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a lot of Iraqi Christians, Wasseem Dawood
has adjusted to the new ways of marking Christmas. Like
always, he will visit relatives, eat rich foods and buy
new clothes. And this year, he will keep watch outside
his church with a Kalashnikov rifle.
</P>
<P>
A mechanic by training, Dawood, 21, became a guard for his
church after it was gutted in a bombing a year
ago. He got 20 days of training in how to
shoot straight and spot terrorists, a police salary of about
$125 a month and a rifle from the government agency
that supports churches.
</P>
<P>
His Greek Catholic(cq) Church of St. George had its walls blown
out and its insides charred and gutted. The blast blew
limbs off the Jesus figure on the crucifix behind the
altar but it was preserved, and the stately, domed church
is being rebuilt, largely by volunteers. Worshippers plan to hold
mass in the unfinished shell on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, children were in the church annex sharpening up
their high-pitched, Arabic Jingle Bells and rehearsing the localized journey
of the Three Wise Men, tracking the nativity star from
the Iraqi cities of Basra, Kirkuk and Suleymaniya.
</P>
<P>
Amid Christmas trees and tales of the jolly, bearded Baba Noel
(Santa Claus), many in Iraq's Christian minority dream of leaving
the country but bravely continue with the traditions of their
faith.
</P>
<P>
"I have to protect the church. There is a priest here
and our God protects us," Dawood said last week by
the palm tree trunks that form a barrier to the
church entrance. "(But) yeah, anyone who holds a Kalashnikov is
in danger."
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 16, 2004, bombers struck five churches, including St. George's,
nearly simultaneously. That and other church attacks in 2004 killed
20 or so, according to reports at the time.
</P>
<P>
But this year was not as deadly for Christians and some
say this third Christmas in the chaotic aftermath of the
U.S.-led invasion will be more relaxed if only because they
are now familiar with the dangers.
</P>
<P>
Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve is now routinely held in the
daylight hours of the afternoon. Rarely do they now hold
the parties, primed with whiskey and running into the early
morning, that brought large numbers of Christians and their Muslim
friends together in social clubs and hotels.
</P>
<P>
"It is a little bit better because more people are used
to the situation," said Amir Oraha, a spokesman for the
largest Christian political party, the Assyrian Democratic Movement. "People should
live their lives."
</P>
<P>
Estimates vary but there are perhaps 800,000 Christians in Iraq making
up about 3 percent of the population. There are five
major denominations - the largest the Chaldean Catholics - and
several smaller ones. Dozens of churches are spread through Baghdad,
some graceful and domed and some boxy and non-descript. Northern
Iraq has large Christian communities.
</P>
<P>
But more Iraqi Christians live outside Iraq than inside, the result
of nearly a century of steady emigration. It's been motivated
by mob violence going back to the Ottoman Empire's rule
of Iraq and spans through the crushing poverty of economic
sanctions and Saddam's brutality in the last decade. Some today
feel threatened by the Islamic fundamentalism unleashed with the collapse
in the old police state.
</P>
<P>
Christians have more opportunity for flight than do their Muslim neighbors,
who face as many dangers. Most already have relatives abroad
and enough money to move, but some say it is
harder to leave now than under Saddam, when Christian countries
were looser with asylum requests.
</P>
<P>
Christian activists give differing numbers from 20,000 to 200,000 for the
number of Christians who have left the country since the
American takeover.
</P>
<P>
So one of the Christmas rituals these days is to make
phone calls to close relatives far away. Samir Naum al-Hayak,
43, a tool shop employee, will be getting in touch
with brothers and other kin in Detroit, Chicago and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
He lives around the block from St. George's and notes that
seven families on his half-mile long street have left the
country since early 2003. Desire to emigrate is almost a
given. "If I have the ability, I will go," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At St. George's, as in many churches, there is an informal
approach to the denominational lines and Christians of different sects
attend. Guard Dawood's family is Chaldean but has been attending
the church since he was a little boy.
</P>
<P>
They held mass in the church the day after the bombing
that, despite the extensive damage, did not wound any one
in the early morning hours. Along with the reconstruction of
the church itself they have added a 12-foot-high wall around
the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
Anita Dawood, Wasseem's 22-year-old sister, has been brushing up on her
Christmas carols with the church choir. She said rehearsals were
cancelled last year in the wake of the bombing but
this year they went ahead with them. A philosophy and
religion student, she said she would like to go to
any country with, "peace and stability." For now, she plans
to decorate the tree, bake cakes and make the usual
nativity scene in their house.
</P>
<P>
"It will be happy even though we live in bad circumstances,"
she said walking home with her mother from choir practice.
"All the churches are threatened but we will go to
mass."

Iraq's Christian parties complain they 
lack funding and are living in danger ahead of landmark 
parliamentary elections scheduled for January 30.
</P>
<P>
Already the victims of several church bombings since August, the 
country's 700,000 Christians, who make up just three percent of 
Iraq's 26 million people, are struggling to get their message 
across.
</P>
<P>
"Governmental parties are able to reach out to the public 
through the media because they have greater financial resources," 
says Odeesho Toma, a member of the Assyrian Patriotic Party, which 
is running on a coalition list with Kurdish parties.
</P>
<P>
Because of its lack of financial clout, the party's Shara (the 
Truth) radio broadcasts in Kurdistan, but its frequency has trouble 
making it to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"We have to hold meetings and symposiums for our people in the 
north to urge them to vote for the list we are part of," Toma says. 
</P>
<P>
Even for parties with deeper pockets, like the Assyrian 
Democratic Movement, television advertising is too costly.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing financial troubles, and huge amounts of money are 
required if we want to make use of satellite TV stations in our 
campaign," says William Warda, the head of the culture and 
information bureau in the Assyrian Democratic Movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering the fact that members of the next parliament will 
only keep their posts for no longer than 11 months, it's not worth 
spending all that money," he adds.
</P>
<P>
The few posters of Christian parties on display bear no symbols 
other than the map of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"For a prosperous Iraq for the unity of our 
Chaldean-Syriac-Assyrian people, vote for list number 148 of the 
Democratic Coalition of the Two Rivers", one poster reads.
</P>
<P>
Another poster shows Iraq's map in white and the ancient symbol 
of a sun engulfing a star and two rivers springing near the 
northern, restive, city of Mosul in tribute to the Tigris and the 
Euphrates rivers.
</P>
<P>
Unlike big governmental partithan one 
million.
</P>
<P>
Some television stations run by Christian parties are working 
from abroad and apparently addressing Iraqi Christian communities 
there, like the Surayah TV of the Bethnarhain Patriotic Union based 
in Stockholm, Sweden and Assyrians based in Chicago.

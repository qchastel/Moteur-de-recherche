The former archbishop of Canterbury launched a campaign Monday to assure the
future of Iraq's Assyrian community, which he said is facing
persecution.
</P>
<P>
George Carey said the Assyrians were the victims of systematic ethnic cleansing,
which had worsened considerably since the fall of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The mainly Christian community has faced relentless persecution for hundreds of
years from the largely Muslim population living alongside them.
</P>
<P>
"In recent months and years churches and monasteries have been attacked and
people have been killed," said Carey, who launched the campaign with Assyrian
leaders at the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
"In one case a young man was kidnapped and beheaded. We are talking about
terrible atrocities, which would undermine any community," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"These are issues of human rights and abuse of people which we have to be aware
of.
</P>
<P>
"It is systematic violence against Assyrian people, driving them out of their
homes and pillaging them. It is putting pressure upon them to get them to
leave."
</P>
<P>
Carey said the Assyrians were also seen as an easy target because they are
Christians in a mainly Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
The Assyrian civilization, which has existed since 3,000 B.C., has one of the
oldest Christian traditions in the world, dating to the first
century.
</P>
<P>
There are 800,000 Assyrians in Iraq and there are thought to be around half a
million living around the world. They still speak the ancient biblical language
of Aramaic.
</P>
<P>
Carey stressed that the campaign to ensure their future is "not a strategy
against Islam."
</P>
<P>
This is simply to say that the Assyrians are now the victims of terrorists and
the imprint of others who want to put their very narrow world view upon others.
We must fight it."
</P>
<P>
Campaign organizer Mark Seddon called for Assyrian rights to be enshrined in the
new Iraqi constitution and for Assyrians dispossessed by the violence to be
given the financial aid to return to their lands and homes.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Doctor Khoshaba George, who runs an Assyrian church in London, said the
community's hopes of a brighter future had been raised with the fall of
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately things went wrong and our condition in Iraq is becoming worse and
worse," he added.

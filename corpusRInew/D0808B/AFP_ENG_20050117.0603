<P>
Gumen kidnapped a Catholic 
archbishop in Iraq's main northern city of Mosul Monday in what the 
Vatican condemned as a "terrorist act" as persistent violence dogged 
the run-up to landmark January 30 elections.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh said his US-backed interim 
government was "prepared for the worst" as insurgent attacks killed 
dozens of people in the space of 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Basile Georges Casmoussa, 66, leader of Mosul's 
Syrian Catholic community, was seized by gunmen at around 5 pm (1400 
GMT) as he was about to enter his car, local priest Father Faraj 
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers then tossed him into the trunk of their vehicle 
before speeding away, said the priest, who follows the rival 
Chaldean rite.
</P>
<P>
The Chaldean patriarch in Baghdad, Emmanuel Delly, said 
Casmoussa "was abducted outside his home as he was returning from a 
pastoral visit in the diocese of Mosul".
</P>
<P>
"He was abducted and taken off in a car. We don't know who took 
him, nor the reason why," Delly told the missionary news agency 
Misna by telephone.
</P>
<P>
"We gave the news to the Vatican and now we are doing everything 
possible to trace him and we hope we can save him."
</P>
<P>
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls said the Holy See 
"condemns in the firmest manner this terrorist act and demands that 
Monsignor Casmoussa be rapidly returned safe and well to his 
ministry".
</P>
<P>
The motive of the abuction was not immediately clear but it came 
amid mounting sectarian violence in the run-up to this month's 
election. The home of the Chaldean patriarch was attacked late last 
year prompting condemnation from Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, a spokesman for one of the main Christian political 
parties suggested the abuction might be an attempt to intimidate the 
community into staying at home on polling day.
</P>
<P>
"It could be an attack on Christians who are willing to 
participate in the elections," said Assyrian Democratic Movement 
spokesman William Warda.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's fledgling security forces, which are to take the lead 
role on polling day, took the brunt of a flurry of attacks around 
Iraq on Monday.
</P>
<P>
North of Baghdad, some 20 rebels ambushed an army checkpoint 
near Baquba, sprayed gunfire and lobbed rocket-propelled grenades, 
killing seven soldiers and a security guard, army officers told 
AFP.
</P>
<P>
A soldier was knelt in morning prayer in a tiny sentry post when 
insurgents came up from behind and decapitated him. Another three 
were burnt to death in a vehicle, the officers said.
</P>
<P>
The killings came after the Iraqi army arrested around 60 people 
in sweeps in the town of Bohrouz, south of Baquba, where the 
insurgency has popular support, said local resident Akeel Mateb.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Qaeda-linked group of Iraq's most wanted man Abu Musab 
al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement 
posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In another attack, seven policemen were killed and 15 wounded in 
a suicide bombing outside a police station in Baiji, home to Iraq's 
largest oil refinery, a senior police officer said.
</P>
<P>
In the village of Al-Dawr, just outside Saddam Hussein's 
hometown of Tikrit, one officer was killed and another wounded, 
police said.
</P>
<P>
In Al-Shurqat, south of Mosul, one policeman was killed and two 
wounded in another attack on a police station, while the body of a 
second officer was found riddled with bullets on a roadside.
</P>
<P>
Amid the violence, the deputy prime minister acknowledged that 
polling day was likely to be mired in violence but argued an 
"imperfect" poll was better than none at all.
</P>
<P>
"I hope elections will go smoothly but we are prepared for the 
worst," Saleh told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The top US commander in Iraq, General George W. Casey, gave a 
similarly gloomy prognosis, saying that election day violence was 
unavoidable despite the coalition's best efforts.
</P>
<P>
With much riding on their performance, Iraqi security forces 
went on the offensive, killing 35 rebels and arresting 64 in the 
space of 48 hours in the formerly rebel-held city of Fallujah, west 
of Baghdad, the government said.
</P>
<P>
West of Fallujah, a suicide bomber blew up a vehicle packed with 
explosives in the city of Ramadi, causing US casualties, a marine 
spokesman said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Two beheaded corpses of Iraqi soldiers were also found in the 
city, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
In Mosul, the US military said it had killed seven insurgents in 
the space of 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Outside Iraq, members of the country's huge emigre community 
began registering for this month's election in 14 countries around 
the globe in what organisers hailed as one of the largest operations 
of its kind.

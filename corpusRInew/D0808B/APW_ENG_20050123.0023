Ethnic and religious map of Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq's 25.4 million people include ethnic Arabs, Kurds and Turks and are
religiously split among the Sunni and Shiite branches of Islam. Iraq, the
largest Arab country with a Shiite majority, also has a tiny Christian minority;
most of its Jewish population was expelled after Israel's establishment. Here is
a look at its ethnic and religious makeup.

ETHNIC DIVIDES
</P>
<P>
ARABS: Accounting for perhaps 80 percent of the population, they are largely
Muslim divided among Sunnis and Shiites.
</P>
<P>
KURDS: A Kurdish minority that accounts for up to 20 percent of the population
is predominantly Sunni Muslim. Kurds want to protect gains made during the years
of self-rule following the 1991 Gulf War, including the establishment of some
democratic institutions. Though Kurdish leaders say they only seek autonomy,
many Kurds harbor aspirations for independence. Thousands of Kurds were killed
when Saddam Hussein's forces gassed the town of Halabja in 1988.
</P>
<P>
OTHERS: Ethnic Turks as well as Assyrians belonging to the Chaldean-Assyrian
church, the main Christian sect in Iraq, are tiny minorities, with Turkmens
concentrated in parts of northern Iraq. Ethnic Turks, displaced by Saddam from
oil-rich provinces in the past, seek to maintain their strength in the northern
oil town of Kirkuk.

<P>
RELIGIOUS DIVIDES:
</P>
<P>
SHIITE MUSLIMS: Estimated at about 60 percent of the country's population, they
are largely Arab but some ethnic Kurds also follow the Shia branch of Islam. The
cities of Najaf and Karbala are the center of Iraqi Shiite's religious
authority. Shiites, whose split with Sunni Muslims dates back to a centuries-old
rift over who was the proper successor to Islam's founding Prophet Muhammad,
long were repressed by Saddam's regime. Many Arab and Western countries worry a
strong Shiite showing in Jan. 30 elections will push Iraq closer to non-Arab
Iran, which is governed by Shiite clerics.
</P>
<P>
SUNNI MUSLIMS: Estimated at more than 30 percent of the population, including
most Kurds. Since independence, Iraq has been ruled by the Sunni minority, which
is wary of the power democratic elections likely would give Shiites. Many Sunni
leaders want the Jan. 30 vote postponed, and militant Sunni clerics have called
for a boycott. An area known as the Sunni triangle west and north of Baghdad has
been a stronghold for Iraqi insurgents battling U.S. occupation and the interim
Iraqi government they consider American puppets.
</P>
<P>
CHRISTIANS: About 3 percent of the population, most belong to the
Chaldean-Assyrian church. Many Christians have fled Iraq, fearing the Islamic
insurgency.

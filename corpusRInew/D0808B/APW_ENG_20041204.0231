1,500 members sent to protect Christians in northern Iraq, says group
leader

<P>
More than 1,500 members of an Iraqi Christian group have gone to
northern Iraq to try to protect Christians following attacks on
churches in Baghdad and Mosul, the leader of the group said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Yonadem Kana, the leader of the Assyrian Democratic
Movement in Iraq and a member of the Iraqi National Council, said the
fighters have been deployed in Baghdida near the northern city of
Mosul.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to transform our movement into a militia," he said.
"But if needed, we can arm more than 10,000 people."
</P>
<P>
Christians make up just 3 percent of Iraq's population of about 25
million. The major Christian groups include Chaldean-Assyrians, who
make up Kana's group, and Armenians.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 16, bomb attacks targeted five churches in Baghdad _ which
damaged buildings but caused no casualties.
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate that as many as 15,000 of Iraq's nearly one
million Christians have left the country since August, when four
churches in Baghdad and one in Mosul were attacked in a coordinated
series of car bombings. The attacks killed 12 people and injured 61
others. Another church was bombed in Baghdad in September.
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants have told Christian owners of liquor stores to
close down their businesses, and they have threatened Christians who
run beauty salons and shops selling fashionable clothes.
</P>
<P>
Kana, who is on a three-day visit to Syria for talks on Iraq's
security, said his movement will not station fighters in other Iraqi
cities. In Baghdad, he said, "we have the cover of law and Iraqi
regular army and security forces."
</P>
<P>
Kana said his movement does not need to be protected by U.S.-led
coalition forces.
</P>
<P>
"We will not accept that our people's ethnic and religious background
be used as a card in the hands of foreign forces to interfere in Iraq
and to prolong the occupation," Kana said.
</P>
<P>
He said he will attend a meeting in Jordan on Monday to discuss ways
to stabilize Iraq ahead of the Jan. 30 elections. Delegates from 18
Iraqi factions and U.N. experts will attend.

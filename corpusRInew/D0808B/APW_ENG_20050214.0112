Members of the Iraqi Christian minority living in the United States voiced hopes
that a spirit of cooperation and national unity would prevail in Iraq even as
Shiite Muslims prevailed in that country's first free elections in over 50
years.
</P>
<P>
A Shiite Muslim clergy-backed slate won 48 percent of the votes and 140 of the
275 National Assembly seats, according to results released Sunday in Baghdad. A
Kurdish ticket got 26 percent and 75 seats. But the country's Christian
minority, which makes up about 5 percent of Iraq's 26 million people, secured
enough votes for just one Assembly seat.
</P>
<P>
"We are extending our hands to our brother Shiites, and Sunnis in Iraq, to work
together to have a ... better, democratic Iraq," said Joseph Kassab, president
of the U.S. branch of the Chaldean National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of Iraq's Sunni Muslim community _ the disenfranchised group
believed to be driving the deadly insurgency in the country _ Chaldeans and
Assyrians joined Shiites and Kurds in making their voices heard during the
elections.
</P>
<P>
But with the National Rafidain List securing just 36,255 votes compared to the
more than 4 million votes for the Shiite's United Iraqi Alliance, Christians
must pin their sights on partnership and support from the other groups to ensure
that their interests are secured as the Assembly drafts Iraq's new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The Shia are good friends to the Christians," said Kassab, voicing hopes that
the suffering both groups endured under Saddam Hussein's regime would bridge any
rifts.
</P>
<P>
The imam at the area's leading Iraqi Shiite mosque said he, too, felt hope mixed
with fear.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good beginning. Not perfect, but a good beginning," said Husham
al-Husainy of the Karbalaa Islamic Education Center in Dearborn. "We should work
toward unity, whether Shia or Sunni or Kurdish."
</P>
<P>
For a fragile democracy to take root after 35 years of Saddam's dictatorship and
two years of occupation, Iraqis, the U.S. government and Iraq's neighbors must
defend it against those who prefer chaos or oppression, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is so much potential of civil war, of ethnic clashing. It's still
flammable," al-Husainy said.
</P>
<P>
Chaldean Americans, who are heavily concentrated in the Detroit area, were
pleased to see their homeland moving in a democratic direction after decades of
dictatorial rule, Kassab said.
</P>
<P>
But Kassab complained that many Christians in Iraq, particularly in the northern
Sunni Muslim province of Nineveh, were unable to cast votes. Turn-out was low in
Sunni areas, partly due to security fears and because of Sunni clerics who
called for a boycott of the elections. Election officials also said that many
polling stations in the province either didn't open or ran out of
ballots.
</P>
<P>
"We lost more than 150,000 votes in northern Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Americans cast 8,975 votes Jan. 28-30 at a polling site in the Detroit
suburb of Southgate. In all, 24,335 of the 265,148 overseas votes were cast in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the single seat won by the National Rafidain List, which
represented Chaldean, Assyrian and other Christian groups, four Christians won
seats on the Kurdish ticket and one was elected on the slate of interim Prime
Minister Ayad Alawi, Kassab said.
</P>
<P>
Kassab said that the main concern for Iraqi Christians now is that minority
rights be enshrined in the constitution to be written by the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"We need them to reconfirm the rights of all Iraq's minorities and religions,"
Kassab said.

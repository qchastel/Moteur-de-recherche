LONDON, July 11
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
London Mayor Ken Livingstone, urging 
people to "carry on" as normal, rode the Underground to work on 
Monday, four days after bomb attacks on the British capital's 
transit system killed at least 52 people.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to work. We carry on our lives. We don't let a 
small group of terrorists change the way we live," the mayor said as 
he boarded the Jubilee Line at Willesden Green station, northwest 
London, bound for City Hall.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether people should try to forget about Thursday's bomb 
attack, Livingstone -- who often uses public transport -- replied: 
"We carry on our lives. I don't think we ever stop thinking about 
last week."
</P>
<P>
Later, Livingstone opened the London Memorial Garden, 
established in the city centre as a memorial to the victims of the 
terror blasts.
</P>
<P>
Before laying white lilies in a solemn ceremony with dignitaries 
and religious leaders, Livingstone wrote in the book of condolences: 
"The city will endure. It is the future of our world -- tolerance 
and change."
</P>
<P>
A member of Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour Party, 
Livingstone is mayor of western Europe's biggest city, with a 
population of more than seven million.
</P>
<P>
"A force much greater than I can express will defeat them (the 
bombers)," Livingstone wrote in London's Evening Standard newspaper 
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is not even the force of seven million Londoners acting last 
Thursday in a way that inspires such pride.
</P>
<P>
"It is because on this matter seven million Londoners speak for 
more than five billion members of humanity.
</P>
<P>
"It is for that reason that those who came to kill and maim us 
at random have no chance of winning. None."
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest manhunts in British police annals is under 
way to find the perpetrators of Thursday's bomb attacks on three 
Underground trains and a double-decker bus.
</P>
<P>
Public transit was running as close to normal as possible 
Monday, with services restricted only on the lines stricken by the 
bombings.

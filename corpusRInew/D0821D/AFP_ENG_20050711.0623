Police on verge of identifying one London bomber: report

LONDON, July 12

<P>
British police are on the verge of 
identifying one person they believe was involved in the bomb attacks 
which killed at least 52 people in London, a report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times, which cited an unnamed European official 
involved in international efforts to find the bombers, said progress 
had been made towards naming who was responsible for a blast on a 
bus on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The bus explosion was one of four co-ordinated bombings, the 
others on London Underground subway trains, which caused carnage in 
the morning rush hour.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are going to see photographs of one or more suspects 
being posted within days," the official told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Separately, The Times newspaper reported that forensic 
pathologists are paying particularly close attention to two bodies 
found inside the wrecked bus to see whether one of them might have 
been the bomber.
</P>
<P>
"There are two bodies which have to be examined in great detail 
because they appear to have been holding the bomb or sitting on top 
of it," a "senior police source" told the paper.
</P>
<P>
"One of those might turn out to be the bomber."
</P>
<P>
Some experts have speculated that the bus bomb might have gone 
off accidentally as the terrorist carried it, possibly to another 
Underground station.
</P>
<P>
According to The Times, a single bomb maker using military-grade 
explosives was most likely responsible for manufacturing all the 
bombs used in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Similar components have been found by police at all four bomb 
sites, the newspaper said without citing a source.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that the materials used to make the 
rucksack-based bombs were manufactured using smuggled, 
military-grade explosives, possibly brought in from the Balkans, the 
paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The nature of the explosives appears to be military, which is 
very worrying," Superintendent Christophe Chaboud, head of France's 
anti-terrorism police, who is helping the London inquiry, was quoted 
as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday London's Metropolitan Police confirmed that the 
explosives used in the blasts were most likely "not home-made", but 
said it remained to be seen whether they were commercial or military 
in origin.

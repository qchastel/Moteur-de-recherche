<P>
London's police chief said on Friday
there was still no evidence that Thursday's terror attacks on the 
capital had been carried out by suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
"We have absolutely nothing to suggest this was a suicide 
bombing attack although nothing at this stage to rule that out," 
Head of London metropolitan police Ian Blair told a press 
conference.
</P>
<P>
London's underground stations were hit by four bomb attacks at 
the rush hour on Thursday morning, which killed at least 50 people
and injured 700.
</P>
<P>
The attacks, the deadliest ever carried out on London in 
peacetime, coincided with a summit of the Group of Eight in 
Gleneagles, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Blair said efforts were still being made to establish the 
precise number of deaths from the blasts on three subway trains 
and one double-decker bus. Police said on Thursday that 35 people 
died on subway trains.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Commissioner Andy Hayman said forensic investigations
suggested each one of the devices used in the attacks had probably
contained less than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of high explosives.
</P>
<P>
Hayman said that the explosive devices, due to their small 
sizes, could have been 
carried to the explosion sites with backpacks.
</P>
<P>
"We do believe that each device put on the Tube trains was put 
on the floor of the carriages," Hayman said.
</P>
<P>
The police commissioner also said it was possible that an 
active terror cell was still intact and capable of another attack.
</P>
<P>
"We must remain vigilant," he said.

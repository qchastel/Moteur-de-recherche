<P>
The terror attacks on London killed more 
than 50 people but an unknown number of bodies still lie in the 
underground railway, London's police chief said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We now know that there are more than 50 fatalities," 
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"There is great difficulty in deciding or determining how many 
fatalities because two of the scenes are very difficult in terms of 
recovery," he said.
</P>
<P>
"One is the bus because of the nature of the explosion and more 
acutely the tube train at Russell Square (subway station in central 
London) continues to hold a number of bodies.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how many are there."
</P>
<P>
A total of 350 people were treated for light injuries at the 
scene. Another 350 had been taken to hospital, of whom 100 were kept 
in overnight. Twenty-two people were still in serious and critical 
conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
One person had died in hospital during the night.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the fact that an unknown number of bodies had not yet 
been retrieved should not be taken as a suggestion that the death 
toll could climb above 100.
</P>
<P>
"It's yet to be the case for us to get near the carriage. There 
is a risk of the tunnel being unsafe. I ask everyone's patience as 
we progress this matter," Assistant Commissioner Andy Hayman told 
the same news conference.
</P>
<P>
"It would be wholly unwise and could inhibit a successful 
prosecution if we rushed this stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hayman said each bomb likely contained less than 10 pounds (4.5 
kilograms) of explosives.
</P>
<P>
In their attack on the subway system, the attackers likely 
placed the bombs on floor of the train carriages, he said.

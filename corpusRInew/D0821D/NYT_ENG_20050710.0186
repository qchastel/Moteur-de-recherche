INCHES AT A TIME, CREWS SEARCH FOR BODIES IN TUNNEL

The subway tunnel between King's Cross and Russell Square
is one of several "deep tubes" bored through London's bedrock
and clay more than a century ago: 70 feet down,
12 feet in diameter and reinforced with iron rings, the
single-track tunnel affords just inches of clearance for trains.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the tunnel intensified the impact of a bomb containing
about 10 pounds of high explosives, sending its force punching
through the cars like a blast down the barrel of
a shotgun. It was the deadliest of the four bomb
blasts in London last week; at least 21 people died
on the train.

<P>
In the days since, dozens of recovery workers in heavy white
protective suits have gone in time and again, entering a
nightmarish scene of mangled remains, twisted metal and hellish temperatures
-- and even an infestation of rats. Crammed tight against
the walls and wreckage, the searchers have crawled carefully, inches
at a time, to avoid disturbing evidence while they try
to recover body parts.
</P>
<P>
By late Sunday, they pulled out the last of the visible
remains of the 49 people known to have died in
the bombings. But even then their job may not have
been finished: The police say more remains might be obscured,
because some people may have been blown out the front
of the train and then run over as it skidded
to a halt.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded in the lead car moments after the train
pulled out of the King's Cross station, blowing apart the
car and making it impossible to reach the dead and
injured from the rear. Recovery teams have had to work
from the Russell Square station, ferrying people and equipment in
and human remains out more than a third of a
mile on a battery-operated trolley recently built for use in
the tunnels in case of a chemical attack.

Deputy Chief Constable Andy Trotter of the British Transport Police said
the recovery was hampered by the heat and stillness of
the air. Temperatures are about 120 degrees, kept hot by
intense lights, heavy equipment and lingering heat from the blast.
The tunnel has been sealed at either end of the
accident site to stop the stench from the bodies from
leaking into the other subway lines that meet at King's
Cross station.
</P>

Trotter said the crews working in the tunnel were wearing heavy
boots, gloves and helmets, as well as face masks because
of the risk of asbestos particles in the air from
the train's brakes. "It's very hot and very dusty and
extremely grim," Trotter said.

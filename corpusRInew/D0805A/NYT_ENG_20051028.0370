A PLAN FOR YOUR FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
November 15 will never rival July 4 or December 25, but
it is definitely a date to remember.
</P>
<P>
That's when Medicare finally enters the age of wellness and prevention.
</P>
<P>
When it started in 1965, Medicare was built around episodes of
illness. If you developed cancer and needed surgery, Medicare would
defray hospital bills. Flu? Broken hip? Medicare paid for doctors
and nursing home rehab.
</P>
<P>
But prescription drugs never entered the picture - an omission that
grew increasingly glaring as modern science proved more and more
effective at keeping people well. It makes no sense to
forgo a $30-a-month generic statin while shelling out $50,000 when
a heart attack leads to hospitalization, surgery and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Politically, drug coverage became a potent campaign issue among the coveted
senior vote. The oft-repeated image of a poor widow choosing
between food and Fosamax always energized a crowd.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Medicare already gobbled up a huge chunk
of the federal budget. With 40-million younger Americans uninsured, could
we really afford to beef up insurance benefits to everyone
older than 65? Even for people who are healthy and
wealthy?
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Bush Administration and Congress crafted an uneasy
compromise with advocates like AARP:
</P>
<P>
Medicare would underwrite a portion of drug costs, but average beneficiaries
would still have substantial out-of-pocket bills.
</P>
<P>
Low-income people would get a better deal than people of means.
</P>
<P>
The government would not dictate prices or even jawbone discounts out
of the manufacturers, as it does with doctors, hospitals and
nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
Instead, insurance companies would act as private drug brokers, setting up
plans that would seek discounts and compete for customers.
</P>
<P>
All of which brings us to Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
That's when people on Medicare can start choosing how to arrange
their health care for 2006. The new drug benefit -
Medicare's biggest transformation ever - complicates those decisions.
</P>
<P>
The drug program, called Part D, is not just new, it
is all over the block. Nineteen companies are authorized to
offer Medicare drug plans in Florida, many with two or
three options.
</P>
<P>
Premiums range from $10.35 a month to $104.89. Formularies cover some
drugs, but not others. Then there is the so-called "coverage
gap," or more informally, the "doughnut hole," or "Krispy Kreme,"
a financial Bermuda Triangle that can swallow coverage when total
drug costs are more than $2,250 and less than $5,100
a year.
</P>
<P>
How complicated is Part D? Medicare's Web site (www.medicare.gov) contains a
list of "frequently asked" questions about the new drug benefit.
Earlier this month, it listed 983 "frequently asked" questions.
</P>
<P>
Such complications aside, there is much to like about these drug
provisions - at least from a beneficiary's standpoint.
</P>
<P>
Medicare is going to pay the insurance companies $700 a year
for everyone who signs up for a drug plan. That
underwrites a lot of drug-buying and still leaves room for
profit. Unlike most insurance - where premiums and copayments cover
the risk - the bulk of this benefit is financed
by taxpayers as a whole, not by the contributions from
individual Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
Humana's Standard plan carries a premium of just $10.35 a month.
Coventry Advantra, PacificCare and WellCare all have plans under $20.
At those prices, even beneficiaries who take no drugs will
benefit from signing up. If they suddenly have a illness,
they will quickly earn back the premium. And if their
health declines later in life, they can get cheap drugs
without paying a stiff premium penalty.
</P>
<P>
Many low-income people who blanch at a $20 premium can qualify
for what Medicare calls "special help." This subsidy reduces premiums,
deductibles and copayments. Yearly out-of-pocket drug costs will average $130
for those people.
</P>
<P>
By adding hundreds of thousands of Medicare clients to their rolls,
the drug plans can buy in bulk and can negotiate
discounts from manufacturers. Discounts will come in handy when beneficiaries
enter the "coverage gap," and have to pay 100 percent
of costs.
</P>
<P>
The new Medicare also improves HMOs and PPOs.
</P>
<P>
Their clients cannot enroll in separate Part D drug plans, which
are designed to supplement Medicare's traditional Parts A and B.
However, Medicare is also beefing up payments to HMOs, to
help them stay competitive. In return, the HMOs must enhance
their drug coverage or other benefits.
</P>
<P>
That suits Pauline Policastri, 72, just fine. The Hudson resident and
her husband, Salvatore, belong to a Humana HMO. She loves
its Silver Sneakers wellness program, which pays for a YMCA
membership so she can take dance and exercise classes three
days a week.
</P>
<P>
Like other HMOs, the Policastris' plan charges no monthly premium and
provides drugs with minimal copayments.
</P>
<P>
If the Policastris were to return to traditional Medicare, they would
face copayments for doctors and hospitals and an extra Medicare
premium if they wanted the new drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
"It's frightening," she says. "What little pension we have doesn't go
up while everything else everything goes up around us. If
you get sick and don't have something to protect you,
you're in trouble."
</P>
<P>
Lastly, the Bush administration has a lot of political capital riding
on Medicare Part D and has budgeted $100-million to inform
people and guide them through the process. Among other things,
administration officials swear that beneficiaries can get all the help
they need by calling a toll-free 1-800-633-4227 hotline. A live
person is supposed to answer, around the clock.
</P>
<P>
Advocates and state agencies figure the drug benefit is a good
deal and are devoting a lot of energy to help
as well. For example, a two-day senior expo scheduled for
Nov. 16-17 at Tropicana Field will feature seminars and enrollment
help for Medicare beneficiaries to assess plans, sign up for
coverage or apply for low-income subsidies.
</P>
<P>
So pull up a chair and browse through this issue of
Seniority. It is full of useful information about the new
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
And mark Nov. 15 on the calendar. You can't sign up
for anything until then. This is just the study phase.

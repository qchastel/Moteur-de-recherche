CONTACTING MEDICARE: A FEW TIPS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Medicare has a toll-free hotline and a Web site to help
people sort through the new Part D drug coverage. Both
options can be frustrating as well as helpful. If you
want Medicare to help you compare drug plans, here are
a few suggestions.
</P>
<P>
BY TELEPHONE
</P>
<P>
Medicare has hired 8,000 people to answer questions about the drug
benefit and they are still learning their jobs. So when
you call, try these tips.
</P>
<P>
1) Have your Medicare card and a list of all your
medications handy. You will be asked for this information.
</P>
<P>
2) Call toll-free (800) 633-4227. A recording will offer you some
phone-tree options. Choose "drug coverage." 3) After listing some pertinent
dates, you will be asked to select either "enrollment" "information"
or "publication." The fastest way to talk to a live
person is to select "enrollment." After giving some of your
personal information, select "agent" the next time you have an
option. That should connect you to a live person.
</P>
<P>
4) If you pick the "information" option, you may find yourself
in a loop of various recordings. When you are ready
to talk to a live person, either return to the
main menu and start over, or select the "status" option
and follow that with the "agent" option.
</P>
<P>
5) Tell the agent you want a list of stand-alone drug
plans and their costs to you, based on your particular
medications. Make sure the agent types in your specific medications
before comparing plan costs.
</P>
<P>
6) If the agent asks if you want to limit your
premium and deductible cost, say "no." It may sound cheaper
to pick plans with zero deductibles or a low premiums,
but those plans may cost you more in the long
run because they cover fewer drugs. Tell the agent to
compare all plans without restricting the premiums or deductibles.
</P>
<P>
7) When the agent lists three or four plans that seem
to be the cheapest, find out what each plan will
cost. Ask if those plans place restrictions on your drugs.
If they all do, ask the agent to look for
a plan that places fewer restrictions, even if it costs
you a little more.
</P>
<P>
8) Write down your top three or four plans and contact
those companies for more detailed information.
</P>
<P>
9) Ask the agent to mail you a written brochure covering
the information you discussed.
</P>
<P>
ONLINE
</P>
<P>
Be prepared to spend at least 30 minutes on this search.
</P>
<P>
1) Go to www.medicare.gov and click on "Compare Prescription Drug Plans."
</P>
<P>
2) About two-thirds of the way down the next page, click
on the orange button next to "Find a Medicare Prescription
Drug Plan."
</P>
<P>
3) Next page: Fill in your personal information and click on
"search plans."
</P>
<P>
4) Next page: Fill in parts A, B and C and
click on "continue."
</P>
<P>
5) Next page: Click on "choose a drug plan type."
</P>
<P>
6) Next page: Click on C "search for Medicare prescription drug
plans."
</P>
<P>
7) Next page: Click on B "Enter my medications." (Do not
click on C "limit your drug plans." If you do,
it may exclude the best and cheapest plan for you.)
</P>
<P>
8) Next page: List your medications into A "find your drugs
by name." When you are done, click on B "continue
with selected drugs." Then click on C "choose my drug
dosage" and use the drop down list next to each
drug to enter your dosage. Then click on B "continue
with selected drugs" then B "continue with plan list." (Skip
the pharmacy option for now.)
</P>
<P>
9) The next page lists the cheapest five plans in order
of cost. Go to a drop-down box at bottom right
and select the "All" function. That will let you peruse
all the plans more quickly.
</P>
<P>
10) To the right of each plan is a drop-down box.
Go to the first plan and select "view cost details"
in the drop-down box. Note that it tells you how
to save money by using a 90-day mail-order pharmacy. Also,
see if your drugs have asterisks next to them. That
means that the plan somehow restricts their usage (more about
that later).
</P>
<P>
11) Go back to the plan list and click on "lower
my cost share" in the drop-down box. This lists possible
substitute drugs and how they will lower your cost. If
you click on the red link to each substitute drug,
the computer will identify the substitutes so you can ask
your doctor if you can safely switch to them.
</P>
<P>
12) Go back to the plan list and click on ".
of pharmacies" next to the first plan. This shows the
pharmacies that will accept this plan. The list is preset
to show pharmacies within 2 miles of your ZIP code.
A drop-down box lets you widen that distance and add
more pharmacy options.
</P>
<P>
13) Repeat steps 10 through 12 with each plan that interests
you. Then contact the plans for full details of costs
and any restrictions on your drugs. You can find plan
phone numbers by going to the plan list and clicking
on the plan name.
</P>
<P>
14) For more information on drug restrictions, go back to Medicare's
home page and click on "Formulary finder." Follow that thread
to the "plan list." In the "Plans per page" box
at bottom right, change the "5" to "All" and scroll
down to the plans that interest you. (All stand-alone drug
plans will have "PDP" in the third column. Click on
those plans for more information on how they restrict access
to your drugs.)

WHICH PLAN? THE ANSWERS ARE OUT THERE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Signing up my father for a Medicare drug plan should be
simple, especially because the Medicare.gov Web site is well designed
and easy to use. If only the real world would
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
My father is 92 years old, lives in a nursing home
and takes 10 prescription drugs, paid for from his savings
and Social Security income. His medicines cost him $636.88 a
month, or $7,642.56 a year.
</P>
<P>
He now gets a discount on his drugs because he has
a Medigap policy, which he buys for $93.23 a month
from AARP to cover some health care costs not picked
up by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
Without the AARP Medigap discount, his drugs would cost nearly 40
percent more: $1,044.72 a month, or $12,536.64 a year.
</P>
<P>
So how does he -- or actually, how do my sister
and I, who manage his affairs -- slash through the
dozens of Medicare drug plans available in the part of
suburban Washington where he lives? How do we decide whether
he should sign up for any of them and, if
so, figure out the best plan for him?
</P>
<P>
My sister, Martha Bari, to avoid the onerous research she was
fearing, considered simply choosing an insurer with a trusted name.
A likely candidate was UnitedHealthcare, the company used by the
AARP Medigap program.
</P>
<P>
But when I looked at the Medicare Web site, the research
tool there seemed easy to use. The site lets the
user compare drug plans, based on the information one enters.
I called Martha and told her I wanted to give
it a try.
</P>
<P>
It turns out that you really do need a computer to
sort through drug plans because there are so many variables.
What drugs are you taking? Where do you live? What
plans are in your area? Are you willing to switch
to generics if they are an option? Do you care
which pharmacy supplies your drugs? Do you want to order
them by mail? Are you in a nursing home that
only uses one pharmacy?
</P>
<P>
Those considerations can affect the price you will be charged. And,
depending on how big a discount a plan offers, you
may be better off with one that does not cover
all of them but that deeply discounts the drugs it
does cover.
</P>
<P>
In terms of your out-of-pocket expenses, such a plan might work
better than a plan that covers every drug but offers
smaller discounts.
</P>
<P>
I set to work, blithely thinking I would could sort things
out in half an hour.
</P>
<P>
I discovered, instead, that it took two days to get the
information I needed before even starting to use the Medicare
Web site. First I had to find out what drugs
my father was actually taking and how much he paid
for them.
</P>
<P>
Initially, Martha and I understood that my father was taking eight
drugs. Only after checking with the nursing home did she
get the complete list of 10.
</P>
<P>
Then I called AARP to find out exactly what type of
Medigap plan my father has and what it covers.
</P>
<P>
Next came a call to the pharmacy to find out what
the drugs would cost without my father's AARP discount, which
involved providing a list of the medications and then waiting
for a call with the prices.
</P>
<P>
And how would my father's Medigap policy be affected if he
signed up for the Medicare drug plan? Would the Medigap
plan pick up some of his leftover drug costs? And
if it no longer covered his drugs, would his Medigap
premium decrease?
</P>
<P>
I eventually learned in a phone conversation with Jim Pogue, who
manages AARP insurance for the UnitedHealth Group, that my father's
Medigap plan would provide discounts on any drug not covered
by a Part D plan. But the Medigap premium would
remain the same whether or not he needed the supplemental
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
That meant that unless a Medicare plan was cheaper than the
$7,642.56 a year my father pays for his drugs with
the AARP discount, he might as well not sign up
for a new plan.
</P>
<P>
Finally, after two days and many phone calls, I had the
information I needed. And the actual process of comparing drug
plans was fun -- a breeze, in fact.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, I plugged my father's drugs into the Medicare Web
site. I specified their doses and the preferred pharmacy, which
is 35 miles from his nursing home but the only
one the nursing home will use.
</P>
<P>
Voila! I got a list of 42 plans. They were ranked
in order, based on my father's total annual out-of-pocket expense
for his drugs would be, including the monthly drug premium
and the annual deductible for each plan. I had the
ability to compare any three plans side by side, in
as many combinations as I chose.
</P>
<P>
The variations were astonishing, with the estimated yearly cost varying by
more than 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the least expensive plan for my father's situation, one offered
by First Health Premier, he would pay an estimated $4,008.72
a year, or $3,633.84 less than he pays now. His
monthly co-payments would be $142.70, lower than with any other
plan, and his monthly premium would be $22.91, among the
lowest of all the plans.
</P>
<P>
Under the most expensive plan, AmeriHealth Advantage Rx Option, he would
pay $8,454.33 for the same drugs from the same pharmacy
-- or $811.77 more than he pays now for those
drugs from that pharmacy. His monthly co-payments would be $673.42,
and his monthly drug premium would be $23.16.
</P>
<P>
It took only 10 minutes to get the list of the
drug plans and their prices for my father from the
Medicare Web site. But the most amazing thing was what
happened next.
</P>
<P>
I went to the Web site again last Tuesday, four days
after first entering my father's data. This time the results
were different.
</P>
<P>
I thought there must be some mistake. But, no, I had
a printout from the first session, and there had been
a change.
</P>
<P>
There were six additional plans that were not there before, for
a total of 48 instead of 42. And the prices
were lower, especially for plans at the high end.
</P>
<P>
First Health Premier was still the cheapest -- but $3,977.01 now,
compared with $4,008.72 four days earlier. AmeriHealth Advantage was still
the most expensive, but its price had dropped to $6,978.94,
from $8,454.33.
</P>
<P>
What was going on?
</P>
<P>
Peter Ashkenaz, a Medicare spokesman, explained that the agency updated the
plans and their prices every Monday. He said that the
insurers were starting to assess one another's plans and revise
them to be more competitive.
</P>
<P>
I asked Ashkenaz: What happens if you choose a plan and
then the next week it becomes cheaper, or another plan
becomes cheaper?
</P>
<P>
As it turns out -- and Ashkenaz allowed that Medicare was
not particularly publicizing this wrinkle -- you can change plans
every day from now until the end of the year
if you want to.
</P>
<P>
Whichever plan you are enrolled in on Dec. 31 is the
plan you will be in when the program starts on
Jan. 1. And you will be paying the rate that
was quoted when you enrolled.
</P>
<P>
Even after that, you can change plans one more time before
May 15, the last time to sign up for the
Medicare drug benefit with no penalty, Ashkenaz said.
</P>
<P>
For those who do not want to use the Web site,
or cannot use it, there is another option. Call Medicare's
toll-free number, 1-800-MEDICARE, specify "enrollment" on the voice-mail prompt, and
tell the customer service representative the drugs you take and
where you live.
</P>
<P>
Medicare says it has 7,500 such service representatives handling calls 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
The service agents are assigned to walk the caller "through everything
that's up there and will send them a printout --
we call it a personalized brochure," Ashkenaz said.
</P>
<P>
I called the number and got right through to a service
agent in the middle of the day last Thursday, with
no wait. I told her that I was a reporter
and that I was just testing the system; I did
not ask her to go through the whole drug plan
search process for me. And then I tried again the
next day with the same result.
</P>
<P>
As for Martha and me, we have not yet signed my
father up for a plan. I told her that I
now think the best strategy is to sign up for
the cheapest plan and then keep checking back every week
on the Medicare site to see if a better option
comes along.
</P>
<P>
Who knows -- maybe the prices will rise in the next
month, and we would want to be signed up before
that happens.
</P>
<P>
Martha says it is up to me to do all that
checking if I want to, but it is not something
she cares to take on. And she wonders how many
people will.

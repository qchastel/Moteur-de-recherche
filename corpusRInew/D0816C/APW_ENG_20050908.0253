The international community must be ready to help North Korea economically once
the issue of the communist country's nuclear issue is settled, South Korean
Deputy Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said.
</P>
<P>
"Something must be done," Han told The Associated Press on the sidelines of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum finance minister's meeting that began
Thursday on the South Korean island of Jeju. He said such a need should be clear
to the global community.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia are trying to persuade
North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons development in talks that may resume
as early as next week in the Chinese capital of Beijing after going into recess
last month.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government has said it is ready to provide massive amounts of
aid, including electricity, to the North if the rival country can reach an
agreement on the nuclear program within the six-party framework.
</P>
<P>
The talks have hit a snag over North Korea's insistence that it be allowed to
possess nuclear power for what it describes as "peaceful means," a stance
opposed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Han, who is also South Korea's finance minister, also proposed expanding the
scope of the APEC trade forum, first by inviting North Korea to participate as
an observer in future finance ministers' meetings pending a resolution of the
nuclear problem.
</P>
<P>
"On condition that there is progress at the ongoing six-party talks, I think we
should consider North Korea to be our first guest," he said in a speech to
finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
Separately, in an interview with a South Korean newspaper Han also called on the
21-member APEC to help create a multinational rehabilitation fund for North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
"I think finance ministers need to take the lead in establishing a
rehabilitation program for North Korea on the condition that the six-party talks
end well," he told The Korea Times.
</P>
<P>
He added that South Korea was consulting with other countries to discuss
establishing a Northeast Asian Development Bank provided agreement is reached
with North Korea on the nuclear issue.
</P>
<P>
He told the AP, however, that there would be no formal discussions of the North
Korean issue at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation is "not happy" with Han's proposal about the rehabilitation
program, according to a U.S. Treasury official.
</P>
<P>
"It's just too premature," the official, who declined to be named, told Dow
Jones Newswires. A successful end to the nuclear talks should precede any such
proposal, he said, adding that Japan shares a similar view.
</P>
<P>
The United States has generally taken a harder line on North Korea, saying the
country's pursuit of nuclear weapons is an international menace and threat to
neighboring countries such as Japan.

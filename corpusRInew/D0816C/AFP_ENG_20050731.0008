North Korean Foreign Minister Paek 
Nam-Sun has said the Stalinist country would return to the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty if a standoff over its nuclear weapons 
drive were resolved, state media said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The offer came last week in Laos during a meeting of Asian 
foreign ministers, according to Radio Pyongyang, monitored by South 
Korea's Yonhap news agency.
</P>
<P>
Paek was quoted as saying North Korea would rejoin the treaty 
and open up to international inspectors "once the nuclear issue is 
resolved smoothly."
</P>
<P>
Similar remarks were made by North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il 
last month during a meeting with a South Korean envoy.
</P>
<P>
North Korea withdrew from the treaty in 2003, three months after 
Washington accused Pyongyang of running a clandestine nuclear 
weapons program based on enriched uranium.
</P>
<P>
North Korea declared on February 10 it possessed nuclear weapons 
and said it needed them as a deterrent to what it said were US plans 
to launch a nuclear attack against it.

North Korea on Tuesday strongly disputed allegations it has a uranium enrichment
program, describing the claim as a U.S. "sheer fabrication"
</P>
<P>
The denial, in a commentary by North Korea's main Rodong Sinmun newspaper, came
hours before six-nation nuclear disarmament talks resumed in Beijing, after a
month's hiatus, to try to get the North to abandon its nuclear
programs.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear row began in 2002 following U.S. allegations that the North was
secretly running a uranium enrichment program in violation of its earlier
promise not to pursue atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We state clearly that we don't have any kind of uranium enrichment program at
all," said Tuesday's commentary, which was carried by the North's Korean Central
News Agency. "The U.S. talk about the DPRK's uranium enrichment program is no
more than a sheer fabrication."
</P>
<P>
DPRK is a short for North Korea's official name, Democratic People's Republic of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The North also harshly criticized Washington for trying to give the impression
that the communist country is to blame for the delay in resolving the nuclear
problem.
</P>
<P>
The North, however, reiterated that denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula remains
a "consistent policy and ultimate goal" of the country.
</P>
<P>
The six-party talks involve the two Koreas, the United States, Japan, China and
Russia.

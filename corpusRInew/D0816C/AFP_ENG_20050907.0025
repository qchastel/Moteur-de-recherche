South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-Moon 
said Wednesday six-nation nuclear disarmament talks on North Korea, 
due to reopen in Beijing next week, would be open-ended.
</P>
<P>
"With no ending date fixed in advance, the talks will continue 
as long as there are chances for making any progress," Ban told a 
weekly briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would "do its utmost to help make 
substantive progress" at the new talks for which host China will 
"soon" fix an opening date. North Korea reportedly prefers September 
13.
</P>
<P>
The comments came as the United States and North Korea, the two 
major players, were still at loggerheads over Pyongyang's demand for 
the right to peaceful nuclear activities, rejected by Washington.
</P>
<P>
"(North Korea) had built the nuclear power facilities for 
decades tightening its belts," Rodong Sinmun, the North's communist 
party newspaper, said in a commentary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is unimaginable for (North Korea) to dismantle its 
independent nuclear power industry built with so much effort, 
yielding to outsiders' pressure, without getting any proposal for 
compensating for the loss of nuclear energy."
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of talks, which involve the two Koreas, the 
United States, China, Russia and Japan, broke off on August 7 for a 
three-week recess and were originally due to resume in the final 
week of August.
</P>
<P>
But the Stalinist North delayed the talks for another two weeks, 
announcing they would resume sometime in the week beginning 
September 12. It cited annual South Korea-US war games for the 
delay.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear standoff began in October 2002 when the United 
States accused North Korea of a secret uranium-enrichment program in 
violation of a 1994 arms control pact.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has denied the US charges but declared in February 
this year that it had already built nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
Since 2003, the six-nation talks have aimed to persuade North 
Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in exchange for diplomatic and 
economic benefits as well as security guarantees.

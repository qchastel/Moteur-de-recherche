Booksellers across French-speaking Europe 
saw legions of Harry Potter fans scramble to their shelves this 
weekend, as the sixth book in the bestselling children's series went 
on sale in translation at midnight on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of bookshops in France, Belgium and Switzerland stayed 
open past the witching hour to welcome hoards of Harry's young 
admirers, eager to purchase their copy of "Harry Potter et le Prince 
de Sang-Mele" ("Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince").
</P>
<P>
Publishers Gallimard have printed a record two million French 
copies of the penultimate tome in British author J.K. Rowling's 
astronomically successful series, predicting a fresh outbreak of the 
"Pottermania" which has surrounded previous installments of the boy 
wizard's adventures.
</P>
<P>
The first five books in the series, created in 1996, have sold 
300 million copies worldwide and more than 17 million copies in 
French translation, while 100,000 French and 30,000 Swiss fans have 
already bought the English edition, which has been out since July.
</P>
<P>
At many bookshops, sales staff in witches' hats served up 
devilish delicacies and magical potions as children young and old 
queued way past bedtime.
</P>
<P>
A thousand customers visited the Brussels store of major book 
and music retailer FNAC between 11:00 pm and 1:30 am (2100 to 2330 
GMT) and bought over 500 books in a bewitching atmosphere of special 
effects and smoke.
</P>
<P>
Competitor Filigranes had opened at 9:00 pm (1900 GMT) for a 
reservation-only evening of entertainment with quizzes, costumes and 
nibbles, and sold 200 copies.
</P>
<P>
Fans in costume crammed into bookseller Tropismes which saw 
"many more than for the last book, and more children because it was 
a Friday", according to store manager Brigitte De Meeus.
</P>
<P>
In France, the FNAC chain ordered a massive 30,000 copies while 
around 15 of their stores stayed open all night, decked out with 
broomsticks, witches' hats, spellbooks and potions.
</P>
<P>
Its central Paris Champs-Elysees branch transformed itself into 
a "forbidden forest" full of scary creatures, normally off limits to 
students of magic at Harry's "Hogwart's school" (or the "college de 
Poudlard" as it is known to French readers).
</P>
<P>
Twice as many copies of the latest tome have been printed 
compared to volume five and three times as many as volume four.
</P>
<P>
Outlets in Switzerland preferred to wait until dawn on Saturday 
to open their doors, but still saw a "blistering start" to sales at 
FNAC stores with less of a rush at competitors Payot.
</P>
<P>
"I've done nothing but stack shelves all day," one FNAC manager 
in Geneva said. "We have sold 120 copies in one-and-a-half hours."
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people will probably buy the book in both languages, as 
many bought it in English for the pleasure of owning it but can't 
actually read it," she predicted.
</P>
<P>
Publishers Gallimard had carefully stage-managed the launch, 
distributing posters of the front cover to bookstores at the start 
of September and installing clocks counting down the final two weeks 
to publication. The release date was also announced in newsletters 
handed out at school gates and printed in youth magazines.
</P>
<P>
Internet sales have also been brisk with major retailer Amazon 
reporting 1.5 million orders worldwide, far outstripping the month's 
other major French language release, Michel Houellebecq's "La 
Possibilite d'une Ile".

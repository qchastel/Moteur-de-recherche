Rowling's sixth Potter book to be published this summer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sixth novel in J.K. Rowling's blockbuster Harry Potter series,
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince," will go on sale in several
countries on July 16, publishers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The book will be published in Britain, the United States, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa on the same day, said the
joint announcement by Nigel Newton, the chief executive of Bloomsbury
Publishing Plc in England, and Barbara Marcus, the president of
Scholastic Children's Books in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted to announce the publication date," they said. "J.K.
Rowling has written a brilliant story that will dazzle her fans in a
marvelous book that takes the series to yet greater heights. `Harry
Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' delivers all the excitement and
wonder of her best-selling Harry Potter novels."
</P>
<P>
The announcement not only pleased the British author's millions of
followers, it also delighted the British stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
Bloomsbury shares surged 7 percent to a new all-time high of 2.94
pounds (US$5.69; euro4.25). Sales of Harry Potter titles have
provided the company with a significant boost in the past, although
in September it said the absence of a new Rowling release this year
had held back its annual rise in profits to 4.5 percent at 3.7
million pounds (US$7.16 million' euro5.35 million).
</P>
<P>
The new book, the publishers said, takes up the story of Harry
Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
when the powers of the villain Voldemort and his followers are
increasing day by day, in the midst of a battle between good and
evil.
</P>
<P>
"The author has already said that the Half-Blood Prince is neither
Harry nor Voldemort. Intriguingly, the opening chapter of `Harry
Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' has been brewing in J.K. Rowling's
mind for 13 years," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier message on her Web site, Rowling wrote: "I know you all
expected this to happen on Christmas Day, but I was sure that those
of you who celebrate Christmas have better things to do on the day
itself than fight your way into my study, whereas those of you who
DON'T celebrate Christmas would definitely prefer not to wait until
the 25th."
</P>
<P>
Rowling, 39, noted that while she is pregnant with her third child,
she has had the time "needed to tinker with the manuscript to my
satisfaction and I am as happy as I have ever been with the end
result. I only hope you feel it was worth the wait when you finally
read it."
</P>
<P>
The 2005 publishing date means that fans will be spared the
three-year wait between Potter IV, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire," and Potter V, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"
which came out in summer 2003.
</P>
<P>
The publishers' statement and Rowling's Web site did not say whether
the new book's length would top the industrial-sized 870 pages of
"Order of the Phoenix."
</P>
<P>
As the London stock market indicated, the new book should be great
news for booksellers, who have endured another year of slow sales.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 million copies of the fantasy series, which debuted in
1997, are in print, and "Order of the Phoenix" sold an astonishing 5
million copies within 24 hours of publication.
</P>
<P>
Sales have remained phenomenal even as Rowling's books have grown
longer and darker, reflecting the boy wizard's development into
adolescence. The first three Potter books have been made into hit
movies. The books also have inspired countless Potter paraphernalia,
including candy, cakes, capes and toys.
</P>
<P>
Rowling has said that one of her characters will not survive her
sixth book, but she refused to identify which one.
</P>
<P>
Potter himself is safe, at least for now. Rowling has said her
teenage hero will survive until the seventh and final book in the
series, but has refused to say whether he will reach adulthood.

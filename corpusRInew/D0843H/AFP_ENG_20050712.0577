Canadian store accidentally reveals secret of new Harry Potter 
book

A Canadian supermarket chain 
scrambled to put the magic of Harry Potter back in the box Tuesday 
after accidentally selling 14 copies of the much-anticipated book 
days ahead of its scheduled worldwide launch.
</P>
<P>
The grocer accidentally stocked shelves last Thursday with 
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince," the sixth book in J.K. 
Rowling's acclaimed series, allowing some unsuspecting customers to 
get a sneak peak at its contents before its scheduled worldwide 
release on July 16.
</P>
<P>
The grocer begged customers to return the books, but if they 
refused, Canadian publisher Raincoast Book Distribution Ltd. sought 
an unprecedented injunction from a provincial court to keep the 
storyline a secret.
</P>
<P>
"The situation right now is contained. It involved a single 
store location and handful of customers. Nobody in Canada has 
spoiled the secret," said Raincoast's Jamie Broadhurst.
</P>
<P>
He refused to say if any of the wayward books had been returned 
or even if the buyers had been identified.
</P>
<P>
"The process is ongoing right now. As you can imagine, the 
situation is somewhat fluid," he said.
</P>
<P>
Previous instalments of the book have sold almost 300 million 
copies worldwide since 1997. While those, too, were shrouded in 
secrecy, extreme pains were taken this time around to safeguard the 
storyline, because the author had previously hinted that one of the 
main characters would die.
</P>
<P>
Justice Kristi Gill ordered the 14 customers not to talk about 
the book, copy it, sell it or read it until after midnight on this 
upcoming Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The judge also compelled the unidentified customers to hand over 
the novel to Raincoast, which has agreed to return them signed by 
Rowling, along with other gifts, after the official launch.

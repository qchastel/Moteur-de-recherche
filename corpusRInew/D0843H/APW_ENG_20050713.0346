A drug store accidentally sold a copy of the latest Harry Potter book to a woman
ahead of Saturday's strict release time, but the customer said she will return
it.
</P>
<P>
Mandy Muldoon said she was shopping with her 9-year-old son when she spotted a
stack of the much-anticipated books on a shelf and purchased one. Christine
Ekblom, a manager at the upstate New York pharmacy, said she believed it was the
only copy sold.

"They were pulled off an hour after they were put on the shelves," Ekblom said.
"It was a mistake."
</P>
<P>
The book, "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince," has been shrouded in secrecy
and its debut has been highly orchestrated to enable everyone _ readers and
reviewers, alike _ to crack it open all at once. It's the sixth in J.K.
Rowling's seven-book fantasy series on the young wizard.

Fourteen books were accidentally sold Thursday at a grocery store in Canada, but
a judge ordered the customers not to talk about the book, copy it, sell it or
even read it before its official release.

<P>
Muldoon's husband said the family would return the book to the publisher, though
his stepson, Sylum Mastropaolo, admitted reading about two pages.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to do the right thing," Mike Muldoon said. "We don't want to ruin
it for other kids and take away from the experience of everyone reading it
together."
</P>
<P>
Kyle Good, a Scholastic publishing spokeswoman, said the company was not aware
of any other early sales in the United States. The company said Sylum would get
a copy Saturday along with a gift pack.

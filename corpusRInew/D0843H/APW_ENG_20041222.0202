Latest Harry Potter book topping demand list six months ahead of
release

<P>
The latest installment in the Harry Potter series won't hit stores
for more than six months but it has already topped at least one
bookseller's most wanted list and is racking up thousands of advance
orders, retailers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Less than 24 hours after publishers announced a July 16 release date
for "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" _ British author J.K.
Rowling's sixth novel set in the halls of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry _ it had shot to No. 1 on online bookseller
amazon.co.uk's Hot 100 book list.
</P>
<P>
The list, calculated from all orders placed by customers on the
retailer's Internet site, put the latest chapter in the boy wizard
fantasy series ahead of best sellers such as Dan Brown's "The Da
Vinci Code."
</P>
<P>
Amazon could not say exactly how many pre-orders it had gotten, but
the company said its Web site had been deluged after it began taking
orders for the novel late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the book has already hit No. 1 in our Hot 100 books
chart shows how incredibly excited customers are about the sixth
Harry Potter," amazon.co.uk managing director Robin Terrell said.
</P>
<P>
Amazon said it took 420,000 pre-orders for the fifth in the series,
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," released in the summer
of 2003, making it the largest ever pre-order item. The company was
expecting a similar response for the latest installment.
</P>
<P>
Jo Marino, a spokeswoman for Waterstones bookstore chain, said
customers had started calling its stores to place orders for the book
immediately after publishers announced the release date Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is so much demand people want to make sure they get their
copy," Marino said.
</P>
<P>
She predicted plenty of readers would also wait until books hit the
stores at 12:01 a.m. (0001 GMT) on July 16 to join in-store parties
and pick up their copy in person.
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, I think we will be seeing queues around the block
like we have for the previous books," she said. "People want to come
down and be part of it."
</P>
<P>
She said when the last Potter book went on sale, Waterstones' central
London store started selling it just after midnight and had sold
2,000 copies within two hours.
</P>
<P>
"We think we will have the same sort of response," Marino said.
</P>
<P>
Publishers have said the new book takes up the story of Harry
Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts when the powers of the villain
Voldemort and his followers are increasing day by day.
</P>
<P>
A seventh and final novel will follow at a date yet to be announced.

    WHAT HARM CAN IT DO? 
</P>
<P>
   A female reader forwards a Wall Street Journal story about a
recent FDA report on possible side effects of Viagra:
</P>
<P>
   ``Abnormal hair growth, speech disorder, amnesia, loss of
libido, hallucination, anorexia, tinnitus, skin discoloration,
hiccups, sleepwalking, eye-rolling hostility, euphoric mood, dry
mouth, agitation, confusion, insomnia, abnormal thinking, abnormal
skin odor, depression, increased sweating, flatulence, abnormal
dreams and belching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Small price to pay!'' writes the sister.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. In other accounts of masculine hardships, cosmetic
dermatologist   Seth Matarasso   told San Francisco magazine that
male lawyers are using Botox to paralyze facial muscles so that
their faces won't reveal their emotions.
</P>
<P>
    FLASH 
</P>
<P>
   - A court in Germany ruled that  Katarina Witt   is a public
figure and, therefore, a Frankfurt newspaper could legally reprint
a photograph of her ice skating nude. Witt had posed for the photo,
which appeared first in Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
    - Norm Macdonald  , interviewed just before his sitcom's debut,
in the latest Rolling Stone, said that he agreed to live in Los
Angeles only to be near his 6-year-old son (he is separated from
his wife).
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is all show-business people,'' said Macdonald.
``It's cool seeing celebrities from the old days, but there are
less and less of them. I only like guys that were famous before I
got into show business _ everyone else is, like, so what?''
</P>
<P>
   - The Sony Pictures film remake of ``Charlie's Angels'' will
star  Drew Barrymore  ,  Cameron Diaz   and   Angelina Jolie  , says the
BBC. The grandes dames of the series _  Farrah Fawcett  ,   Kate  
  Jackson   and   Jaclyn Smith   _ are said to have been asked to make
cameo appearances.
</P>
<P>
   - Was it an April Fool's joke, wonders   Jacki Bernier  , that
that day's issue of the Berkeley Voice carried the banner notice:
``Daylight Savings: Don't forget to set clocks back an hour
Sunday''?
</P>
<P>
   - More than 25 years ago,   Jessica Mitford  's muckraking
magazine story about the Famous Writers School closed down that
institution. Now,   Bob Treuhaft  , Mitford's widower, is pleased to
report that in February, a year after Vanity Fair posthumously
published her essay raking the funeral conglomerate Service Corp.
Inc., the value of that company's shares had dropped by two-thirds.
She would have wanted it that way.
</P>
<P>
   - Actress and literary critic   Christina Ricci   told Teen People
magazine that her favorite book is   Ayn Rand  's ``The
Fountainhead.'' ``It's really interesting how she romanticizes a
way of dealing with emotions and people that's so different than
what we're given in films and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
          WHO SAID WHAT 
</P>
<P>
    ``Having your portrait painted is a strange experience. At the  
  same time, to anyone who has served in Washington, there is  
  something oddly familiar about it. First, you are painted into a  
  corner. Then you are hung out to dry. And finally, you are  
  framed.'' 
</P>
<P>
   - Former Secretary of State   Warren Christopher   at the
unveiling of his portrait in the State Department last week.

SEN. HARKIN URGES GUIDELINES FOR CHILDREN'S FOOD ADS

Labeling Shrek cereal by General Mills and a promotional
children's book that features Kraft's Oreo cookies as extreme examples
of marketing to children, Sen. Tom Harkin issued a sharp
rebuke on Wednesday to the nation's largest food companies.
</P>
<P>
Harkin, D-Iowa, criticized the food industry for contributing to childhood obesity
by spending $10 billion last year on marketing to children
-- much of it, he said, to promote sugary and
nutritionally deficient products. He called on food companies to do
more to limit what they advertise to children.
</P>
<P>
Harkin also said that he intended to introduce a bill that
would give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to regulate
advertising to children. Currently, the commission has greater authority over
advertising aimed at adults.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely hope that the industry will develop tough and effective
marketing guidelines," Harkin, a member of the Senate Labor, Health
and Human Services Committee, said. "But when private interests work
against the public good like this, government is obliged to
act."
</P>
<P>
He was joined on Wednesday by several critics of the food
industry
</P>

Marketing to children has become a major issue for the $500
billion food industry. According to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, the number of overweight children in the United
States has doubled in two decades, and 15 percent of
American children are overweight or obese. Type II diabetes, which
is linked to excess body weight, is being found in
such high numbers among children that it can no longer
be referred to as adult-onset diabetes.

<P>
Two months ago, Kraft Foods announced that it would stop television
advertising of certain products it considers unhealthy to children under
12. Kraft will not reduce its $90 million a year
worth of advertising aimed at children. Rather, it will alter
the product mix, increasing ads for Sugar-Free Kool-Aid and 100-calorie
packs of thin crisp Oreos.
</P>
<P>
Many in the food and advertising industries say that advertising is
not a factor in obesity or diabetes. They focus on
lack of exercise as the primary cause of America's childhood
obesity problems.

<P>
Dan Mindus, a senior analyst at the Center for Consumer Freedom,
an organization funded by food and restaurant companies and various
individuals, pointed to an analysis of Census data done at
the University of North Carolina. Researchers there found that from
1980 to 2000, caloric intake among adolescents had risen 1
percent while physical activity has declined by 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Senator Harkin would be well served to focus his energies on
getting more PE back into schools," Mindus said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to promote physical activity, McDonald's last week announced
a global marketing campaign featuring athletes and information about a
"balanced lifestyle."
</P>
<P>
Michael Jacobson of the Centers for Science in the Public Interest
said that exercise was being used by the food industry
as a way to distract people from the inconvenient fact
that many of the food products aimed at children are
nutritionally deficient and have too many calories. "Companies are taking
a pot of white flour and a pot of refined
sugar and adding maybe some fat and food coloring and
flavoring and calling it food, but it's basically junk," said
Jacobson, whose organization is funded primarily by subscribers to its
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
A full table of food aimed at children was on display
in Harkin's office Wednesday. Holding up a box with the
Shrek character emblazoned across the front, Harkin dug out a
magnifying glass to read a description of what was inside.
"Kids just see that it's Shrek," he said. The product
was General Mills' Shrek cereal, or sweetened corn puffs with
marshmallow pieces, containing 14 grams of sugar per serving.
</P>
<P>
Representatives at General Mills did not comment on Harkin's criticisms.
</P>
<P>
A Kraft spokesman, Mark Berlind, said the company was looking at
the issue of licensed characters on packaging, but had no
plans to make any changes at the moment.

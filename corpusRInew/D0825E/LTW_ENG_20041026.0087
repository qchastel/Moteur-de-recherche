Trainers for Kids? We're Serious. We Think
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We can see your eyes rolling already, but bear with us: Should an
inactive child use a personal trainer to become more fit and healthy?
</P>
<P>
Time was, that question might have seemed ludicrous. But in an era
of overworked (and under-fit) parents, justifiable desires to keep
kids from roaming neighborhood parks solo, ubiquitous butt-bound
digital entertainment and a habitat loaded with high-calorie treats,
today's kids increasingly are tomorrow's chronic disease statistics.
Approximately 30 percent of children ages 6 to 19 are overweight and
15 percent are obese, according to the American Obesity Association.
And child obesity predicts adult obesity with frightening accuracy.
</P>
<P>
But a personal trainer? A $50- to $70-an-hour luxury most of us
don't even allow ourselves?
</P>
<P>
``We may lose a generation to obesity and diabetes,'' said Rich
Salke, owner of Rich Bodies, a gym in Georgetown. Salke works with
many children, fat and fit alike, as young as 10. Even
well-intentioned parents might lack the knowledge and community
resources to rescue their children from the express lane to obesity,
Salke said.
</P>
<P>
Other experts, including some who have no vested interest in kids'
training, agree.
</P>
<P>
``The exercise professional who should have the greatest impact on
public health (for children) is the personal trainer,'' said Walter
Thompson, a kinesiology and nutrition professor at Georgia State
University and an expert on personal trainer programs. ``If parents
see that their child is overweight, they should consider'' personal
training, Thompson said. He and others say children as young as 7 or 8
could start working with trainers.

Trainers can help kids who don't enjoy organized sports or are
embarrassed doing active things with fitter kids. You can use body
mass index (BMI) to determine if your child is overweight or obese.
(Find a child BMI calculator at
www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/bmi-for-age.htm.) But Steven Horowitz,
Maryland director of the National Strength and Conditioning
Association (NSCA) and director of Velocity Sports Performance in
Rockville, Md., has a simpler method: ``It's pretty obvious when your
kid tries to run down the block or up stairs. If they cannot do that
(because they get winded), you have a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
So, okay, maybe a trainer could help your child. But won't kids get
bored by the follow-the-clipboard-around-the-gym routine?
</P>
<P>
Yes, said Salke. He frames exercises as games to keep kids
interested and having fun. One routine involves hanging a rope from
the ceiling and testing kids to jump up and touch it, first with one
hand, then the other. ``That builds quad power and coordination, and
they love it,'' he said. He has kids hurl stability balls at the
ground to see how high they'll bounce, and jump back and forth over a
band stretched between two points. Salke works with individual kids
and small groups, including sibling pairs.
</P>
<P>
Salke and Thompson agree that the training must be fun for the kids
and that parents should pick trainers experienced with children and
certified by NSCA or the American College of Sports Medicine (no group
yet certifies in pediatric training). Insist on talking to parents of
other child clients.
</P>
<P>
``This can be expensive,'' Thompson said, ``but so is the loss of
income and wealth when the child becomes ill with a lifestyle-related
disease like Type 2 diabetes, heart disease or cancer.''

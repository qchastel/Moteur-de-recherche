N.H. WEIGHS STUDENTS TO MONITOR FOR OBESITY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Schools across New Hampshire have yanked junk food from the vending
machines and reduced the fat in cafeteria lunches. Now, nearly half
of the state's schools are measuring whether students are truly
eating healthier -- by the pound.
</P>
<P>
Twice a year, in more than 230 schools, students, from kindergarten
through high school, step on a doctor's scale as part of a growing
statewide effort to combat childhood obesity. Volunteers calculate
each child's Body Mass Index -- a measure of body fat based on height
and age -- to see who's overweight or obese.
</P>

New Hampshire is taking the unusual step of tracking children's
weight in school because the state's percentage of overweight
children is greater than the national average. Researchers hope to
weigh students and test their physical fitness in all 500 schools in
the state within the next two years; some schools began the weigh-ins
as a pilot last school year. While some health professionals and
parents like the idea, some students aren't so thrilled about
stepping on a scale in school.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to do this to show them their fitness level and
deemphasize their body shape and size," said Dr. Walter Hoerman, a
pediatrician who led efforts in the Rochester, N.H., school system to
improve children's health.
</P>
<P>
Rhode Island is the only other state pushing the same approach, said
Tamara Martin, a University of New Hampshire professor and chairwoman
of the state's Healthy Schools Task Force, a spinoff of a national
effort.
</P>
<P>
Next month the Massachusetts Legislature is expected to take up a
bill that would ban unhealthy vending machines from schools and
require more physical education. But the state has no plan to start
weighing kids, said public health and school officials.
</P>

At the Rochester Middle School, students line up in the gym each fall
and spring for their turn at the scale. They also do sit-ups,
push-ups, and pull-ups as part of a battery of physical tests to
measure their strength, endurance, and flexibility. Students' weights
are attached to identification numbers, not names. But some students
say they're self-conscious about the process, because classmates
become competitive.
</P>
<P>
"Other kids had to stand 5 feet away from the scale, and sometimes
some of the kids have good eyesight where they can actually read the
thing," said Sarah Prantis, a sixth-grader at Rochester Middle
School. "All the kids were asking 'How much do you weigh? How much do
you weigh?' But I didn't want to tell."
</P>
<P>
Prantis said the experience made her realize that she was out of
shape and that she needed to lose weight. She took swimming lessons
over the summer and has since joined a swim team. She also signed up
for a daily health class elective where students learn about food
groups and go on neighborhood walks. Instead of coming home to eat,
she now plays soccer with her three dogs, because she has more
energy.

<P>
Parent Terry Desjardins, whose 10-year-old daughter will enter
Rochester Middle next fall, said she is grateful that the schools are
making her children's health a priority.
</P>
<P>
"I know there are people who would say that's not the place of a
school system, but I feel this is a teaching moment for a lifetime,"
said Desjardins, who enrolled her two daughters in a nutrition
program sponsored by a local hospital. "If we can get our kids to
think about not just today but healthy habits five years from now,
I'm all for that."
</P>

Hoerman, a father of three teenagers, said the middle school was
careful not to put adolescents in an embarrassing situation and had
debated using calipers to measure students' body fat. The school
decided against it, because the results are not always accurate, he
said. Plus, an adult would have to pinch children's fat to measure
it.
</P>
<P>
Obesity contributes to 300,000 deaths nationally every year, Hoerman
said. Childhood obesity can lead to problems later in life, including
diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and certain
cancers, he said. Obese refers to someone whose weight is about a
quarter more than the maximum desirable for his or her height.
</P>
<P>
According to New Hampshire data collected since last school year, 18
percent of girls and 22 percent of boys in kindergarten through high
school are overweight or obese, compared to the national average of
16 percent. Health professionals say 5 percent of US youth should be
labeled obese or overweight.

School systems nationwide are starting to re-examine their food
offerings and fitness programs, said Jean Schultz, a health
specialist with the National Middle School Association. They've
tweaked their fund-raisers, cutting out bake sales and candy sales.
But she warned that schools should tread carefully when it comes to
weight.
</P>
<P>
"Some districts have tried to include a letter home saying 'Your son
or daughter is X number of pounds over the norm' and that has not
been well received," Schultz said. "Parents were offended because
they thought the schools were being invasive and not kind to their
children. The interest of the schools were to raise awareness at
home, but kids who are in the middle level, like adults, are
sensitive about how they look and how much they weigh."

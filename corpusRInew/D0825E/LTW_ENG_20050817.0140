Targeting Obesity, Companies Will Limit School Drinks
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Some of the fizz will disappear from beverage vending machines in
schools across the United States in a move aimed at attacking
childhood obesity by limiting the kinds of drinks sold to children.
</P>
<P>
The American Beverage Association -- which represents 20 companies
that make up about 85 percent of school beverage sales -- announced
new guidelines Wednesday aimed at reducing consumption of drinks
believed to contribute to childhood obesity.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. were among the beverage
manufacturers that signed on to the guidelines announced Wednesday in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines -- which are not mandatory -- were unveiled as the
beverage industry comes under increasing fire from parents and health
advocates.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, drinks sold in elementary schools would be
limited to water and 100 percent juice.
</P>
<P>
In middle schools, the guidelines restrict sales to ``nutritious''
or lower-calorie beverages -- which include sports drinks, water, 100
percent juice, no-calorie soft drinks and low-calorie juice drinks.
</P>
<P>
However, participating beverage companies may still sell
full-calorie sodas and juice drinks with 5 percent juice or less in
middle and high schools after classes end.
</P>
<P>
Soda will be offered in high school beverage vending machines but
will make up no more than 50 percent of the selections.
</P>
<P>
In some places the guidelines may not take effect for several
years, because existing contracts with schools will be allowed to
expire.

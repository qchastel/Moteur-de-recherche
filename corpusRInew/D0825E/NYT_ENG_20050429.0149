Lawmakers think Texas schoolchildren better shape up, and they
don't just mean in reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
These kids need to lose some weight.
</P>
<P>
Citing childhood obesity as a serious problem, bills in the Legislature
propose increasing the required physical education classes from three times
a week to five times a week for students in
kindergarten through ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't make them healthier when they're young, it's very
hard to reverse that when they're older," said state Rep.
Martha Wong, R-Houston, who wrote House Bill 2785.
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Lewisville, filed similar legislation, Senate Bill 42.
</P>
<P>
"We are starting to see the consequences of de-emphasizing basic health
and nutrition in our schools in the form of chronic
diseases caused by obesity and illness," Nelson said. "We only
get one body in this lifetime, and we need to
make sure that our children know how to take care
of it."
</P>
<P>
Becky Watts, spokeswoman for the Illinois State Board of Education, said
Illinois is the only state that requires daily physical activity
for public school students.
</P>
<P>
But government is increasingly recognizing obesity as a health threat. The
Internal Revenue Service made weight-loss treatment tax deductible in 2002,
and last year, Medicare officially recognized obesity as a disease
and started evaluating which weight-loss treatments the program would cover.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that she has a lot of support for her
bill requiring more physical education but that she's heard some
concerns from middle school officials who already have a tight
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Cecil Floyd, the association's executive director, said many middle schools reduced
physical education because the Legislature required them to do so
much else.
</P>
<P>
"There's just a whole lot of courses being required at the
middle school, and there's just no time to offer other
classes," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Floyd agrees that children need more exercise.
</P>
<P>
One out of three Texas schoolchildren is overweight or severely overweight,
according to the Texas Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
It's a serious problem, said Judith Stern, vice president of the
American Obesity Association, in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
"They can be setting up a pattern for life," she said.
"If a fat kid becomes a fat adolescent, they're more
than likely to become a fat adult."
</P>
<P>
State Rep. Ryan Guillen, D-Rio Grande City, filed a bill to
make sure schools don't cheat on meeting their physical education
requirements. House Bill 517 forbids schools to count time spent
walking to and from class and the school bus as
physical activity.
</P>
<P>
Other bills address obesity, such as Senate Bill 205, which would
put students' body mass index on their report cards. Senate
Bill 1379 encourages more stringent school nutrition policies than the
federal government demands. (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)

Lisa Wheeler, the P.E. teacher at Oaklawn Elementary School in Fort
Worth, said her school has physical education classes five times
a week, and she tries to make it count because
students don't seem to have the energy or stamina they
had when she started teaching 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"It seems like before, they had been a lot more active.
... They tend to stay inside, and when they stay
inside they tend to watch TV, play video games and
eat junk food," Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
Rene Walker, a Fort Worth mother, said she sees the same
problem with her children. Her youngest is in high school,
and she has to encourage him to eat better and
stay active.
</P>
<P>
"Oh God, it's chips and Coke, I swear that's all he
eats," she said. "I have to kick him out the
door periodically because all he wants to do is watch
TV and play video games."
</P>
<P>
But the system is also to blame, she said, because children
are required to stay at their desks in school for
so much testing.
</P>
<P>
"I think parents feel like there is a lot of emphasis
on testing and performing well in school, and there's so
much pressure on the kids," said Walker, who is president
of the Fort Worth Council of PTAs. "When you're sitting
in a desk all day and you don't have much
release, that's very stressful for kids."

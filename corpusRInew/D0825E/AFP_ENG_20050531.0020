<P>
Sweets, carbonated drinks, sweetened 
milk and fatty foods will be banned from 433 schools across the Thai 
capital this semester to tackle sugar consumption and obesity, a 
report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ban follows reports that 25 percent of students are obese, 
Bangkok Metropolitan Authority deputy governor Pensri Pichaisanit 
told the Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Fresh fruit and fruit juices would replace the sweet and fatty 
foods, while the only milk distributed to schools would be fresh, 
Pensri said.
</P>
<P>
Schools with contracts with food distribution companies would 
need to discuss the ban with education authorities, she said.
</P>
<P>
The ban supports an anti-sweets campaign by the Paediatrics 
Society of Thailand to reduce the numbers of children hooked on 
sugar, which can lead to diabetes and obesity.
</P>
<P>
Health officers would inspect students' teeth and weight and 
report any improvements to authorities, Pensri said.

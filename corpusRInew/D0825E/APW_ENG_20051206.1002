Television advertising strongly influences what children under 12 eat, and
popular cartoon characters should be used to promote only healthy foods, a panel
of scientists said in a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report by the Institute of Medicine said the food industry should spend its
marketing dollars on nutritious food and drinks.
</P>
<P>
"The foods advertised are predominantly high in calories and low in nutrition _
the sort of diet that puts children's long-term health at risk," said J. Michael
McGinnis, a senior scholar at the institute and chairman of the report
committee.
</P>
<P>
The report said evidence is limited on whether TV advertising leads to obesity
in children. A study hasn't been done that would demonstrate a direct cause and
effect.
</P>
<P>
Still, the panel found the evidence compelling enough to call for a concerted
effort to change the nature of foods being marketed to children, said panel
member Ellen A. Wartella, psychology professor at the University of California,
Riverside.
</P>
<P>
The growth in new food products targeted to kids has been huge, from 52
introduced in 1994 to nearly 500 introduced last year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"Overwhelmingly, those foods are high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, not the kind
of foods that are recommended for children to eat," Wartella
said.
</P>
<P>
The findings were no surprise to Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who requested the
report.
</P>
<P>
"We like to think that SpongeBob SquarePants and Shrek and the pretty little
princesses are likable, kid-friendly characters, but they're being used to
manipulate vulnerable children to make unhealthy choices," said Harkin, the
senior Democrat on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The industry must stop pushing junk food on our kids," Harkin
said.
</P>
<P>
Nickelodeon in October announced a campaign aimed at persuading kids to eat
healthy foods and to get up off the couch and move. The campaign features former
President Bill Clinton and the cartoon characters SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora
the Explorer.
</P>
<P>
Among children and adolescents from ages 6 through 19, obesity rates have
tripled over the past 40 years. Obesity increases the risks of type 2 diabetes
and many other diseases and health conditions.
</P>
<P>
The food and beverage industries argue that they already are taking steps
recommended in the report, making products healthier, shrinking package sizes
and touting healthy lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
"The growth in the food and beverage industry is in healthier foods," said
Richard Martin, spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers Association. "There's
been a sea change in the last couple of years, and I don't think that's very
well reflected in this report."
</P>
<P>
The panel assessed hundreds of studies, then reviewed evidence from 123 of them
and completed the most comprehensive review to date on the scientific evidence
of how food marketing affects kids' diets.

In the United States, each person consumes an average of the
equivalent of "31 teaspoons of sugar" a day, or 20 percent more than
the level consumed 20 years ago, Rigby said.

Studies conducted in 15 members of the European Union showed that
obesity costs society between 75 and 130 billion euros annually, and
that 72,000 new cancer cases attributed to overweight are discovered
each year.

<P>
In China, sugar now represents a third of the population's
nutritional values, compared to 15 percent a decade ago.

Specialists currently recommend that people limit sugar consumption
to "less than 10 percent" of their diet.

"If you're overconsuming sugar every extra unit increases the risk of
having obese kids and those obese kids turn into obese adults who are
on a slippery slope to serious health problems," Rigby said.

According to data provided by the experts, half of the sugar consumed
by American children comes from sodas and other sugared drinks and a
third comes from candy.

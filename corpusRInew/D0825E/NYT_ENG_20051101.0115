ONE EXPERT WARNS THAT HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP IS THE LEADING CULPRIT BEHIND AMERICA'S CHILDHOOD OBESITY EPIDEMIC.
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High-fructose corn syrup isn't completely responsible for the nation's six million
overweight children -- but Dr. George Bray says it's a
big part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Nurture trumps nature in the current childhood-obesity epidemic, says Bray. It's
the environment we're creating for our kids that's the problem,
and that environment includes increasing numbers of products high in
high-fructose corn syrup, or HFCS.
</P>
<P>
Bray, who served as founding president of the North American Association
for the Study of Obesity and organized the first international
congress on obesity in 1973, points out that between 1970
(when HFCS was introduced) and 2000 (when average yearly consumption
of the ultra-sweet liquid sugar hit 73.5 pounds per person
in this country), the prevalence of obesity more than doubled,
from 15 percent to almost one-third of the adult population.
</P>
<P>
And worse, much worse, obesity among children 12 to 19 --
who consume a disproportionate amount of the soft drinks, fruit
juice, sports drinks and packaged cookies and other baked goods
that are sweetened with HFCS -- increased from 4.2 percent
in 1970 to 15.3 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The implications for our children's future are clear: "We know that
if it's not caught early, one in three of these
overweight children will grow into overweight adults at increased risk
for type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and early
death," Bray said at a SS presentation for doctors and
nurses at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth last
month.
</P>
<P>
But there is hope. Obesity is largely preventable through changes in
lifestyle, especially diet, says Bray, who called for removing soda
machines from schools and reducing portion sizes of commercially available
sodas in his now-famous commentary in "T""he American Journal of
Clinical Nutrition" in April, 2004.
</P>
<P>
Larger portions, more high-fat fast foods, less exercise of any kind,
irregular sleep patterns, lower consumption of milk and other high-calcium
foods, and increased consumption of HFCS in beverages go a
long way toward explaining the obesity epidemic, Bray says.
</P>
<P>
"Genetic factors play an important role in the development of obesity,
but given the rapidity with which the current epidemic of
obesity has descended on the U.S. and many other countries,
environmental factors are a more likely explanation," he says. "Whatever
its genetic and biochemical determinants, obesity in man is susceptible
to an extraordinary degree of control of social factors. Environment
is very important."
</P>
<P>
Bray says the problem with HFCS is not only that it
is sweeter than other forms of sugar, but also that
it does not affect appetite. Fructose adds to overeating because
it does not trigger chemical messengers that tell the brain
the stomach is full and no longer hungry, like food
and drinks that contain regular refined sugar do.
</P>
<P>
An internist whose pioneering research helped establish the connections between weight
gain and the development of type 2 diabetes, Bray is
a research professor and former director of the Pennington Center
at Louisiana State University, the largest nutritional research center in
the world.
</P>
<P>
He says consumers would be a lot better off without added
sugar in any form, but that artificial sweeteners are much
preferred over calorically sweetened drinks, even for children.
</P>
<P>
"Children less than 5 probably shouldn't have any sweetened drinks, and
for older children, diet drinks are better than regular soft
drinks and fruit drinks," Bray said. "A lot of parents
are concerned about the 'chemicals' added to sweeten diet soft
drinks, but all forms of extra added sugar and artificial
sweeteners are bad. We don't need added sugar in our
diet."
</P>
<P>
Bray says parents should be in charge of diets, children should
be in charge of their own exercise activities, and perhaps
government should regulate portion sizes.
</P>
<P>
Kids should be required to be active a certain amount of
time each day, but after you tell them to turn
off the TV and get moving, you should let them
decide if they want to go outside and play with
friends, ride bikes, swim, play ball, skate, play tennis, go
shopping or whatever, as long as they are moving. When
parents require children to "work out" or "exercise," the children
are more likely to stop moving altogether as soon as
they get away from home, Bray says.
</P>
<P>
He is calling for improved packaging and labeling for food meant
to be consumed as a single serving. Too many ready-to-eat
foods and drinks are labeled as single servings but packaged
as two or even three servings.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to find a single-serving soft drink," he said. "Portion
size is something government (BEGIN BRACKET)the Food and Drug Administration(END
BRACKET) can and should do something about."

On Bray's list of the things people can do to prevent
childhood (and adult) obesity:
</P>
<P>
-- Get more sleep. (Lack of sleep has a bad effect
on leptin, a hormone responsible for appetite control. Major new
studies in Japan and Germany show that the fewer hours
a child sleeps, the greater the prevalence of obesity.)
</P>
<P>
-- Decrease sedentary activities. (Limit TV and computer time, and replace
at least one hour of inactivity with any combination of
favorite activities, every day.)
</P>
<P>
-- Drink more milk. (Calcium is clearly important to weight control.)
</P>
<P>
-- Drink fewer sweetened beverages. (Even fruit drinks and diet soft
drinks should be limited, but especially cut down on regular
carbonated soft drinks.)
</P>
<P>
-- Get as much of your sugar as possible from whole
fruits. (Think blueberries, strawberries and bananas to sweeten breakfast cereals;
apples and oranges for dessert.)
</P>
<P>
-- Think portion control, even with healthy foods. (Serve less on
the plates, and allow for seconds.)
</P>
<P>
-- Get everyone in the family to eat breakfast. (Have hot
or cold cereal most days. Bray eats a lot of
oatmeal.)
</P>
<P>
-- Don't smoke, especially if you're pregnant. (Recent studies show that
intrauterine exposure to inhaled smoke produces a dose-dependent increase in
the weight of children, beginning at adolescence.)

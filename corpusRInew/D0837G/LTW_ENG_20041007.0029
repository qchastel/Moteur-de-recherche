Ill. GOP Watches Take-No-Prisoners Campaign
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SPRINGFIELD, Ill.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the space of six weeks, Republican U.S.
Senate candidate Alan Keyes has branded his Democratic opponent an
``academic socialist'' and said Jesus would not vote for him. He has
likened the Illinois political machine to Third World despotism. He
has said homosexuals, including Vice President Cheney's daughter,
Mary, are ``selfish hedonists.''
</P>
<P>
``What was I supposed to say, 'No, she's the vice president's
daughter, she's exempt?' '' Keyes asked one day recently aboard his
campaign mobile home, rolling south on Interstate 55 to a rally here.
</P>
<P>
Keyes, itinerant apostle of conservatism, lost two U.S. Senate
races in Maryland and finished far out of the money in two Republican
campaigns for the presidency. He is now on his way to losing the
Illinois battle for the Senate by 45 percentage points, if recent
polls are borne out.
</P>
<P>
Overtaking his opponent, Democratic meteor Barack Obama, was always
an impossibility, but Keyes has polarized even the Republicans. To his
own great delight.
</P>
<P>
Keyes has exposed -- and critics contend he has deepened -- a rift
among Illinois Republicans. When they have won statewide office, they
have won with candidates who espoused more moderate social and
political values than those beloved by Keyes and his followers.
</P>
<P>
``I'm a Republican, but it's the worst thing that could happen to
Republicans,'' said Ron Pierce, a locksmith attending a dinner of the
McHenry County Friends of NRA.
</P>
<P>
The welcome for Keyes was mixed -- polite, scattered applause and no
cheers -- as he began to work the tables. To some in this group,
Keyes's candidacy is a sideshow that only highlighted the party's
futility. Several said he has devoted too much time to the wrong
issues.
</P>
<P>
``He's for the Second Amendment and against abortion. That's all
well and good, but he's not from Illinois, so he shouldn't even be
here,'' said Richard Beebe, who owns a heating and air-conditioning
business. ``He doesn't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
Keyes, 53, jumped into the race in August when the Illinois
Republican Party found itself without a likely candidate. The previous
Republican contender, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race after his
ex-wife said he had tried to pressure her into having sex at clubs in
front of others.
</P>
<P>
The state GOP found few others willing to challenge the charismatic
Obama and his $10 million war chest. They checked with local political
luminaries and had a short dance with former Chicago Bears coach and
twinkle-eyed tough guy Mike Ditka, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Enter Keyes. Sharp-tongued and -- like Obama -- Harvard-educated, he
had many titles. He is a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
a former assistant secretary of state, former president of Alabama AM
University and former talk show host.
</P>
<P>
When he was recruited for the campaign, he was a freelancer in
several fields, working to make a living as a lecturer and writer
while training for a marathon. The state of Maryland had placed a
$7,481.99 lien on his Gaithersburg home for an unpaid 1997 income tax
claim.
</P>
<P>
Keyes had never lived in Illinois, but he liked the campaign idea --
not least because Obama would be his opponent. Keyes and Obama are
African-Americans, ensuring the Senate its third popularly elected
black senator in history.
</P>
<P>
Putting together a campaign organization with the help of a few
Washington hands and a loyal band of aides drawn to his stern moral
code and a familiar spirit of insurgency, Keyes found an apartment in
Calumet City and ditched the running clothes in favor of business
suits.
</P>
<P>
--(optional add end)--
</P>
<P>
He has no money to spend on television ads and he has no realistic
hope of defeating Obama, but that does not mean he cannot summon a
prayer. During a two-day swing from Rockford to Union, Lincoln,
Bloomington and Springfield, Christianity figured prominently in his
remarks.           Never more so than in Lincoln, where he advised a youthful a
udience
watching from the Lincoln College bleachers to make ``godly choices.''
His first applause line of the day came when he said the Constitution
does not demand the separation of church and state. He warned of a
``dictatorship of the judges.''
</P>
<P>
``If there are no godly choices, be a godly choice,'' Keyes said.
``By preaching the Gospel, we can transform the nation.''

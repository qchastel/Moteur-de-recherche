Obama Is Dominating High-Profile Race
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ALTON, Ill.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this year, Starlet Travis voted Republican
in the U.S. Senate race here.
</P>
<P>
But come November, she's casting her vote for a Democratic state
senator, though she disagrees with the politician's stance on some
social issues. After Travis watched Barack Obama speak at a fundraiser
here a few days ago, she rushed to meet him.
</P>
<P>
``You're the only person in this race that we trust,'' she told
Obama, as she gave him a photograph to sign. ``You aren't talking like
a crazy man.''
</P>
<P>
With a tired smile and dark circles under his eyes, Obama hugged
Travis and signed the photograph.
</P>
<P>
That scene is playing out all across Illinois as this race makes
history: It's the first time in a U.S. Senate race that the candidates
from the two major parties are black. The fight to fill Republican
Sen. Patrick G. Fitzgerald's open seat will give the Senate its third
back member since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
While no one says the race is close, it is nevertheless one of the
highly watched political contests this season.
</P>
<P>
On one side is a Harvard-educated attorney and long-time Illinois
resident who practiced civil rights law. Obama, whose father was from
Kenya and mother was from Kansas, rose to national prominence after
delivering a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention
this July. Former National Basketball Association star Charles Barkley
stopped by Obama's office this week to say hello and Annie Leibowitz,
the celebrity photographer, spent a day with the Obama family for
Vanity Fair magazine.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, he has raised $14 million in campaign funds. He
diverted $250,000 to support the party organizations in battleground
states and helped raise $260,000 for Senate candidates in 13 states.
</P>
<P>
On the other side sits Alan Keyes, who earned a bachelor's degree
and doctorate in government at Harvard. The former State Department
official was an ambassador to the U.N. Economic and Social Council
during the Reagan administration. The Maryland resident has previously
criticized politicians such as Hillary Rodham Clinton for running for
office outside their home state. Keyes, who also has worked as a cable
TV talk show host, jumped into the race in August. A poll conducted
last week by the Pantagraph newspaper and WEEK-TV show that Obama
holds a 45-percentage point lead over his rival.
</P>
<P>
But Obama is not taking anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
``We've worked hard, we've had wonderful support from voters and we
have Alan Keyes,'' said Obama, 43, at a rally last weekend in Decatur,
Ill. ``I think the situation speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
Illinois Republicans had found themselves without a candidate in
August after Jack Ryan dropped out because divorce records alleged he
tried to force his wife to visit sex clubs. The state party approached
two former Illinois governors, two state senators and former Bears
coach Mike Ditka. All declined to run against Obama.
</P>
<P>
The party then turned to Keyes, who said yes. He qualified for the
ballot by renting an apartment in the working-class Chicago suburb of
Calumet City.
</P>
<P>
Republican officials had hoped that Keyes' ethnicity, Harvard
education and conservative views would be competitive against Obama.
Keyes opposes abortion, gay marriage, affirmative action and gun
control. Those views put him in stark contrast to Obama, who supports
affirmative action, abortion rights and has voted in favor of
background checks on all gun sales.
</P>
<P>
The candidates held their first debate Tuesday night on the radio,
battling subjects including the Iraq war and improving the economy.
The two were a contrast in style.
</P>
<P>
Obama was calm and analytical, breaking down the problems and
carefully choosing his words. ``I have spoken of eliminating tax
breaks that have been given to companies that send opportunities
overseas,'' Obama said.
</P>
<P>
Keyes was the eloquent orator: ``One of the problems we face is
shrinking our manufacturing and industrial base,'' Keyes said. ``If we
had preserved those jobs, we wouldn't have these problems.''
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Keyes' political strategy has been one of extreme
sound bites and outrageous quotes.
</P>
<P>
Keyes said that his rival wrongly ``claims an African-American
heritage'' because his mother was white. He has compared the state's
political leaders to despots and described Chicago Mayor Richard M.
Daley as a ``troll.'' He called homosexuals, including Vice President
Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter, ``selfish hedonists.''
</P>
<P>
In fact, say political experts, Keyes himself -- and what he'll say
next -- has become one of the race's leading issues.
</P>
<P>
``Keyes has alienated almost every constituency in this state,''
said Paul Green, a political scientist at Roosevelt University in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the state Republican Party don't have much to say
about Keyes and the Senate race. ``We're focused on the presidential
race right now,'' said Jason Gerwig, communications director for the
state Republican Party. Despite his low standings in the polls, Keyes
has campaigned throughout the state. He is attracting crowds that
range from a few dozen to a few hundred.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, he strolled along the streets of Marengo at the city's
annual Settler's Day parade. Keyes grinned at cheering spectators.
Afterward, he joined a couple hundred supporters to grill bratwursts,
munch chips and talk politics.
</P>
<P>
``We're trying to reach every part of the state,'' Keyes said.
``Especially places like Marengo where there is common sense and a
sense of decency and moral values.''
</P>
<P>
Clarence Dillance, a shop owner who came to meet Keyes, said the
event cemented his vote. ``I'm proud to be a Republican, and I want to
vote for Mr. Keyes,'' Dillance said. ``I really believe in what he
says.''
</P>
<P>
But Keyes' has not been well-received by blacks, said Robert
Starks, director of the Harold Washington Institute at the Center for
Inner City Studies at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted last month by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and
KMOV-TV showed that only 2 percent of Illinois' black voters are
supporting Keyes.
</P>
<P>
At first, black voters say they found themselves flummoxed: If both
men are black, which candidate should they support?
</P>
<P>
``But then, we started to hear what both candidates were saying and
how they were saying it,'' said Cecelia Hardnett, 61, a state
contractor who attended the Democratic rally in Decatur. ``I think the
Republicans misjudged how we would react.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Hardnett stopped speaking as Obama and a cluster of reporters --
including a writer from Vogue magazine -- walked through the door. As
Obama stepped on stage, the audience clung to his words.
</P>
<P>
He chuckled about his big ears and having a name no one can
pronounce. He reminisced about church and faith, and proclaimed that
having a Republican in the White House had led to ``our values being
under siege.''
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Hardnett stepped in line to meet Obama. Nearly everyone
held a pen, waiting for an autograph.

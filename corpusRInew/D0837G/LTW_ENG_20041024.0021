Giving Obama the Keyes to Victory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These have not been the best of times for Alan Keyes, the perennial
presidential hopeful who is now the GOP candidate for the Senate in
Illinois. The most recent poll by the Chicago Tribune shows him
trailing Democrat Barack Obama by an incredible 51 percentage points.
National Republicans have kept their distance, particularly since
Keyes disparaged Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter.

<P>
Now it seems even the Illinois GOP is cutting Keyes loose. The
Tribune reports that he was left off a state party mailer -- ``Your
2004 Republican Team'' -- listing every candidate from President Bush
to the state legislature. The state party spokesman said no snub was
intended because ``the Keyes campaign is doing its own thing.''

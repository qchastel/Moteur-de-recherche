Conservatives overreacted when they threatened to boycott doll-maker American
Girl over its contributions to a youth group that supports abortion rights, U.S.
Sen. Barack Obama said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It's just silly," said Obama, an Illinois Democrat. "This is a classic example
of overreaction and a lack of proportion."
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the youth group's Omaha chapter, Obama praised Girls Inc. and
said it played an important role in helping girls set goals for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"An organization like this plays a vital part in making certain we are opening
up our windows and letting our girls look upon the horizon and see which path
they want to follow," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the American Family Association asked its roughly 2.2
million members to tell American Girl they don't support the company's
connection to Girls Inc. The Pro-Life Action League also has asked its
supporters to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
The protest is directed at an ongoing American Girl campaign in which proceeds
from sales of a special "I Can" wristband help support educational and
empowerment programs of Girls Inc. The AFA called it "a pro-abortion,
pro-lesbian advocacy group."
</P>
<P>
Randy Sharp, director of special projects for the AFA, said Obama was entitled
to his opinion and the group will continue to urge its members to contact
American Girl and Mattel Inc.

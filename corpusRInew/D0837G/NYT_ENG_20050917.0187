OBAMA URGES BLACK HARVARD ALUMNI TO HELP FIGHT POVERTY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Introduced to a sold-out luncheon for black Harvard Law School alumni
as a rock star and a hero, US Senator Barack
Obama urged the nearly 1,000 people in attendance to take
personal responsibility in combating the urban poverty brought to light
after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
"The people that we saw in front of the Superdome and
in front of the convention center, they had been abandoned
before the hurricane," Obama, an Illinois Democrat, said.
</P>
<P>
Mayhem and violence were not phenomena created by the disaster, Obama
said. They have existed in inner cities across the country
while the nation's political leaders have stood by, largely indifferent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The violence has always been there. It just wasn't on your
television screen because it wasn't spilling out onto the lives
of the rest of us," said Obama, who lives in
Chicago's South Side.
</P>
<P>
Obama, a 1991 Harvard Law School graduate who in 1990 became
the first black editor of the Harvard Law Review, delivered
the keynote address Saturday during the school's three-day Celebration of
Black Alumni.
</P>
<P>
People stood along the back of the white tent, hovered between
tables, and spilled into the courtyard for a glimpse at
the man who many call a rising star in the
Democratic party. Law students lined the stairs of a nearby
building to hear the speech, which was broadcast in two
classrooms set up to handle the overflowing crowd.
</P>
<P>
Last summer's Democratic National Convention in Boston served as Obama's "coming
out party," said Elena Kagan, dean of the law faculty,
when Obama, then an Illinois state senator running for US
Senate, mesmerized the audience with his speech about the audacity
of hope.
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's luncheon, Kagan presented the 44-year-old Obama with the Harvard
Law School Association Award, the school's highest honor, for being
a "gifted orator, dynamic leader, public servant extraordinaire, and pride
of Harvard Law School."
</P>
<P>
Obama challenged his fellow alumni to do everything they can to
alleviate the "festering sores of poverty and racism," and hold
national leaders accountable for their promises.
</P>
<P>
He said the federal government's slow response to the hurricane stemmed
not from racism, but from indifference.
</P>
<P>
"I do not ascribe to the White House ... any active
malice," Obama said. "But rather what was revealed was a
passive indifference that is common in our culture, common in
our society - the sense that of course once the
evacuation order was issued that you will hop in your
SUV with $100 worth of gasoline and load up your
truck with sparkling water and take your credit card and
check into the nearest hotel until the storm passed. And
the notion that folks couldn't do that simply did not
register in the minds of those in charge."
</P>
<P>
Miles LeBlanc, a 1981 alumnus and the general counsel for the
Houston Community College System, likened Hurricane Katrina to a "gigantic
yellow highlighter highlighting all the inequities that exist in our
country."
</P>
<P>
In a public question and answer session after the speech, LeBlanc
told Obama that community colleges are working to train evacuees
now in Houston with new job skills such as construction
and plumbing. Obama said he would work to get them
federal funding.
</P>
<P>
"We want to ensure that people who've been displaced have opportunities
to participate in the rebuilding of their own communities," Obama
said.
</P>
<P>
This weekend marked the second gathering for black alumni at Harvard
Law School, which - except for the historically black Howard
University School of Law in Washington, D.C. - has produced
more black lawyers than any other law school in the
United States, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The first gathering was held in 2000 after the school felt
it needed to better connect with its black alumni, many
of whom felt disaffected and distant from their Harvard experience,
LeBlanc said. Events like the one held this weekend, he
said, have "gone a long way to bring [black] alumni
back in the fold of the law school."

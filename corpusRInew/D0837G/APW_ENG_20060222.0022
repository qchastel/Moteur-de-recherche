The freshman U.S. senator with the Midas touch

<P>
Sen. Barack Obama is showing the Midas touch in his first year in Congress. He's
already a best-selling author, a Grammy Award winner and now he is an important
fundraiser for fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the first-term U.S. senator from Illinois has helped raise $6.5
million (euro5.45 million) for his political action committee and other
Democratic candidates, party committees and U.S. state parties from New Jersey
to Virginia to Florida.
</P>
<P>
A former Illinois state senator and Chicago community activist, Obama rode to
U.S. Senatorial victory in 2004, after a rousing Democratic National Convention
speech. Some Democrats have hailed him as the future of the party.
</P>
<P>
He brought in about $800,000 (euro670,466) in donations with an e-mail message
sent out on activist Web site MoveOn.org on behalf of Democratic Sen. Robert C.
Byrd, of West Virginia, who at age 88 is seeking a ninth term in
office.
</P>
<P>
"He said some nice things about me," Byrd recalled. "Anywhere he comes in West
Virginia we will give the man a great reception. He's a wonderful
man."
</P>
<P>
Some of Obama's fundraising activities are part of his job as a vice chairman of
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
"These are trips not initiated by me; these are trips that other people think
will be helpful," Obama said, noting he has family and political obligations in
Illinois. "For every invitation I've accepted, I've turned down
100."
</P>
<P>
"I've been incredibly blessed," he said in an interview with The Associated
Press. "My attitude is as long as I work hard, as long as I operate honestly,
with integrity, the worst that can happen to me is that I can lose an
election."
</P>
<P>
Being the Senate's lone black member and only the fifth black senator in
history, Obama has prompted many fellow Democrats and others to wonder if he
will become the nation's first black president, or vice president.
</P>
<P>
"The party needs him and, for all I know, the nation needs him," said George
Washington University political analyst Stephen Hess. "There hasn't been an
African-American Democrat who has had an appeal broadly beyond his ethnic
group."
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats and Republicans alike, who often use "gentleman," and "humble,"
and "hard working" to describe Obama, the 44-year-old married father of two
daughters, say he is destined for bigger roles in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
"I think people look at him and think he's clearly, clearly going to continue to
grow in influence in the Senate and in national politics," said Republican Sen.
Mike DeWine.
</P>
<P>
"I've been here 31 years and seen a small handful of people that have made as
much an impression as he has and he has done it by working hard," said
Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy.
</P>
<P>
In Illinois, Republican state lawmaker Kirk Dillard, said he has been impressed
with Obama since they successfully worked together on campaign finance reform
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Illinois and America are looking for a hero and somebody who gives us
hope, as we saw at Coretta King's funeral, that we can be a color blind
society," Dillard said. "It's not just based on race. It's based on we want a
hero in general."
</P>
<P>
Obama trailed only the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
and former Secretary of State Colin Powell in support among blacks asked to name
the nation's "most important black leader," according to an AP-AOL poll released
last week.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he feels burdened by others' expectations, Obama said, "I remind
them that's a pretty high-class problem to have. I remind them that the people
who are burdened don't have health care and see their kid get
sick."
</P>
<P>
He won a Grammy this year in the spoken word category for his readings from his
autobiographical "Dreams From My Father," a memoir first published in 1995 that
has become a best seller as his fame has grown.
</P>
<P>
In the trenches of the Senate, Obama has worked as a member of the Veterans
Affairs Committee to improve disability pay for Illinois' military veterans
after news reports showed the state has been ranked nearly last in that category
for decades.
</P>
<P>
He has traveled abroad with Republican Sen. Richard Lugar, the chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and worked in bipartisan fashion to address
the need of destroying surplus and unguarded conventional and nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
With only a few months on the job, as a member of the Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee, he was credited with playing a key role in winning
transportation projects for Illinois.
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain got in a dustup as
they exchanged letters on how they should be moving toward lobbyist ethics
reform. McCain accused Obama of turning partisan on an issue where he claimed he
would be nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
The argument was apparently resolved with a smile and backslap from Obama at a
congressional hearing.

LOBBYING REFORM PROVES TO BE UPHILL BATTLE ON CAPITOL HILL; AS
McCAIN, OBAMA TRY TO MEND RIFT OVER ISSUE, HOUSE WARNS
OF RESISTANCE WASHINGTON -- Lobbying reform, which looked like a
sure thing after kingpin lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty to
corruption charges, is proving more difficult than expected.
</P>
<P>
Two high-profile senators on Wednesday tried to paper over their dispute
on their issue, and GOP House members braced for an
airing of their sharp differences at a three-day retreat that
begins today.
</P>
<P>
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., testified before
a Senate panel that they were committed to working together
on reform legislation despite a recent, testy exchange of letters
in which McCain accused Obama of injecting partisanship into the
issue.
</P>
<P>
McCain, a potential 2008 presidential candidate, told the rules committee that
he valued Obama's efforts to broker a bipartisan agreement.
</P>
<P>
McCain has proposed making it easier for senators to challenge earmarks,
which are projects that lawmakers tack onto spending bills, sometimes
at the behest of lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
Jokingly referring to McCain as his "pen pal," Obama, a freshman
and rising star in the Democratic Party, said he not
only wanted more scrutiny of earmarks but also to create
an independent commission to police the activities of lawmakers and
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
Obama later said McCain had misunderstood his criticism of a bipartisan
lobbying reform task force spearheaded by the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
Obama said his criticism was aimed at Senate Majority Leader Bill
Frist's remarks that the task force should study the issue;
Obama said the matter needed action, not just talk.
</P>
<P>
But even as the senators pressed their case for changing the
way Congress does business, other lawmakers warned they were meeting
resistance from many of their colleagues, particularly to a plan
to ban privately funded travel by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after federal prosecutors reached a plea bargain with Abramoff, who
may implicate some lawmakers, congressional leaders rushed to offer lobbying
reform plans.
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., a reform advocate, said that in
the past two weeks, "we are hearing the sound of
furious back-peddling in the corridors of power."
</P>
<P>
In the House, new Majority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he
has doubts about barring private groups from paying for congressional
trips.
</P>
<P>
The ban is among several measures proposed by House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., last month.
</P>
<P>
Boehner was elected to replace Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, whom many
Republicans feared had become a political liability because of his
close ties to Abramoff.
</P>
<P>
But Boehner also has links to lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
He rents an apartment in Washington from a lobbyist whose clients
have an interest in legislation overseen by the Education and
Workforce Committee, which Boehner had recently chaired, the Washington Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lobbying reform is expected to be the major topic for House
Republicans during their retreat on Maryland's eastern shore, said Jo
Maney, a spokeswoman for Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., who was
directed by Hastert to devise lobbying legislation.
</P>
<P>
The original plan was for the lobbying bill to go to
the House floor by March, but no longer. More lawmakers
must weigh in first, Maney said.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's got opinions," she remarked.

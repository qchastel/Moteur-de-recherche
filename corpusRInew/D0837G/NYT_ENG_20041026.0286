THE REMARKABLE RISE OF BARACK OBAMA

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>

<P>
Barack Obama drove to Milwaukee the other day and stirred up a crowd
on behalf of Russell D. Feingold, a 12-year veteran of the U.S.
Senate. Another day, he sent $25,000 to South Dakota, where Tom
Daschle, the Senate minority leader, is fighting to keep his seat.
</P>
<P>
Obama, a mere state senator from the South Side of Chicago, is
running against Alan Keyes, a Republican who is trailing him in one
poll by 47 percentage points. His campaign has raised more than $14
million and has given $400,000 to various Democratic races.
</P>
<P>
Just months ago, Obama was seen as a long shot even for the
Democratic nomination to run for the Senate seat being vacated by
Peter G. Fitzgerald, a Republican. But Obama won the primary in
March, and then Jack Ryan, Obama's original Republican opponent,
dropped out amid allegations that he had pressured his former wife,
the actress Jeri Ryan, to go to sex clubs.
</P>
<P>
Then, Obama delivered a rousing keynote address at the Democratic
National Convention and, in 20 minutes, his rising star was
ascendant.
</P>
<P>
If elected, Obama is likely to get more attention and scrutiny -- and
to demand more prestigious assignments -- than another freshman
senator might. He would become the only black person in the Senate,
and only the third since Reconstruction. Obama said he is aware of
the risks of fame and raised hopes.

<P>
"I'm mistrustful of our celebrity culture," he said in an interview.
"I think it's fickle. What's lasting is the work."

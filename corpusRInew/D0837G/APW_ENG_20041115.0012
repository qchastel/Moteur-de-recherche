Barack Obama working to balance Democratic stardom with local
interests
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the days since he was elected to the U.S. Senate, Barack Obama has
chatted by phone with President George W. Bush, had his picture in
People magazine and appeared several times on national television.
</P>
<P>
He's also been quizzed by the likes of 17-year-old Abby Longbottom,
who joined her senator-elect in the stuffy basement of the Rockford
Public Library to hear him talk about after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
Such is the life of the United States' only black senator, who comes
to Washington wearing the label of the Democratic Party's great hope
but promising only to work for the folks back home.
</P>
<P>
"I have not taken the hype too seriously," Obama said after bidding
farewell to his colleagues in the Illinois Legislature last week.
"When you've worked in relative obscurity for a long period of time,
I think you make a decision that you're in this to actually get
something accomplished, as opposed to seeking out the limelight."
</P>
<P>
The limelight, though, continues to seek out Obama, who became a
political star after a rousing keynote address at the Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
Before that speech, he was a relative unknown, a state senator from
Chicago who had come out on top of a primary field of seven Democrats
competing for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen.
Peter Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
Obama skated through what could have been a tough race when the
millionaire Republican primary winner dropped out amid a sex scandal.
Then John Kerry's campaign picked him for the convention keynote, and
the rest was history for the 43-year-old Harvard Law School graduate
and self-proclaimed "skinny kid with a funny name."
</P>
<P>
Obama's autographs now fetch bids on eBay and Internet sites offer
"Obama '08 President" bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
Obama, the son of a Kenyan father and American mother, was born in
Hawaii. He barely knew his father, also named Barack, who left to
attend Harvard when his son was 2.
</P>
<P>
Obama's parents divorced and his father returned to Africa, where he
worked as a senior economist for the government before he died in a
car accident. His mother remarried and moved the family to Indonesia.
At about age 10, Obama returned to Hawaii, where his grandparents
helped raise him.
</P>
<P>
Although Obama has appeared on political television talk shows and
sifted through 100 interview requests, most of his time since the
Nov. 2 election has been spent outside the national spotlight. He
traveled across Illinois and packed in crowds at library conference
rooms and city hall chambers, where people wanted to know what he
would do for their schools or businesses or local bus service.
</P>
<P>
In Rockford, a manufacturing town about 145 kilometers (90 miles)
northwest of Chicago, Obama promised to work to close tax loopholes
for businesses that move overseas and encourage passenger service to
return to the local airport. And he admitted how hard it would be to
pass many of his broader initiatives _ such as health insurance for
all children _ as a new senator in the minority party.
</P>
<P>
Still, his broad appeal was evident even at those local meetings.
Deki Fox traveled 1 1/2 hours from Milwaukee to Rockford just to tell
Obama how much she liked him, even if he wasn't her senator.
</P>
<P>
"With all this talk of mandates, you have my mandate and the mandate
of people way beyond Rockford or even the state of Illinois," Fox
said. "We are people who are divided as a country, and we need your
presence ... to bring our states back together and to bring us back
together as an American people."
</P>
<P>
"That's a pretty big job you just gave me," Obama said, prompting
laughter from the library crowd. Someone shouted back, "You can do
it!"
</P>
<P>
When pressed, Obama acknowledges that all the attention is likely to
give him more influence than a typical rookie in Congress, but he
seems well aware of the perils of his star status. He calls the
presidential talk "silly" and says his first weeks in Washington will
be spent finding the bathrooms and learning the ropes.
</P>
<P>
If he's going to meet the expectations many have for his political
future, Obama is right to ignore the hubbub, said Bruce Ransom, a
political science professor at Clemson University.
</P>
<P>
"Though others may be pushing him into celebrity status, he has to
demonstrate to the voters of Illinois as well as to his colleagues in
the Senate that he is not a prima donna," Ransom said. "He's the new
kid on the block, and he could be eaten alive if he's not careful."

U.S. Sen. Barack Obama can add Grammy-award winner to his resume after winning
in the Best Spoken Word category.

Obama won Wednesday for his readings of the autobiographical "Dreams From My
Father," which first was published in 1995 but became a best seller as Obama
became a rising political star.

Obama, the son of a black father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas, beat
out Garrison Keillor, Al Franken, Sean Penn and George Carlin to win. His memoir
examines race and racial identity.

He joins fellow Democrats Hillary and Bill Clinton in grabbing the trophy.
Hillary Clinton won in 1997 for her spoken word album, "It Takes a Village," and
Bill Clinton won for his reading of his autobiography, "My Life."

<P>
Notable US congressional contests on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
US SENATE
</P>
<P>
SOUTH DAKOTA
</P>
<P>
South Dakota's congressional delegation has confounded Republican
leaders for years.
</P>
<P>
The sparsely-populated state is staunchly Republican -- George ring
Republican Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the Senate's only Native
American.
</P>
<P>
A conservative businessman, Coors' opposition to the death penalty
got him into hot water with some Colorado voters when he said during
a debate that he would oppose the execution of Osama bin Laden. He
also drew criticism for saying he favored lowering the legal drinking
age to 18.
</P>
<P>
Salazar's family has been farming in the same region of Colorado and
New Mexico for generations, and he is seen as having an edge with the
roughly 17 percent of Coloradans who share his Hispanic heritage.
</P>
<P>
FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
In Florida, a key battleground state, Democratic educator Betty
Castor is in a neck-and-neck battle with Republican Mel Martinez, the
former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the George W.
Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
If he wins, Martinez (along with Colorado's Salazar, should the
Democrat prevail in Colorado) would be the first Hispanic in the
Senate in many years.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls haven states to stump for Democratic presidential
nominee John Kerry, as well as fellow congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
"Barack Obama's importance to our party and our effort to recapture
the United States Senate simply cannot be overstated," said Brad
Woodhouse, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Republican's Illinois Senate campaign unraveled when candidate
Jack Ryan withdrew over a sex scandal stemming from the release of
steamy court records from a contentious divorce.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans reached several states away to recruit
African-American conservative Alan Keyes, a Maryland radio talk show
host, to be their standard bearer, but he has largely been rejected
by Illinois voters and Obama has built a 45-point lead over Keyes.
</P>
<P>
Keyes and Obama are vying to replace retiring one-term Republican
Senator Peter Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
KENTUCKY
</P>
<P>
Democrat Dan Mongiardo was not expected to be much of a contender
against popular Republican incumbent Jim Bunning in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
But Bunning, 73, a former professional baseball player, squandered a
double-digit lead after making what some have seen as bizarre and
intemperate comments on the campaign trail, and now leads the
Democrat by just a few points in the solidly-Republican state.
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame pitcher has been hounded by questions about his
mental health. Republicans accuse Democrats of smear tactics, and say
they are spreading rumors about Bunning's mental state as an act of
desperation
</P>
<P>
Among Bunning's actions which raised eyebrows: he said Mongiardo
looked like a son of Saddam Hussein. He later apologized for the
remark.
</P>
<P>
He also aired TV commercials labeling Mongiardo a "Medicaid
millionaire," featuring a luxurious home and a private jet. But it
later turned out that neither the home nor the jet belonged to
Mongiardo.
</P>
<P>
Mongiardo, 44, a doctor and state legislator, is receiving a fresh
infusion of cash from the Democratic Party, which likes his chancesr
to become Louisiana's governor, but is a shoo-in in his current House
race.
</P>
<P>
A Republican, Jindal gained the support of right-wing white voters by
emphasizing his Catholic faith and socially conservative agenda while
downplaying his ethnic heritage.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old son of Punjabi immigrants was defeated in the race
for governor last year by then-Lieutenant Governor Kathleen Blanco.
</P>
<P>
Jindal is now running for the House in suburban New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
A poll by Southern Media and Opinion Research places Jindal, with 65
percent support, comfortably ahead of his nearest rival, State
Representative Steve Scalise.
</P>
<P>
A large majority of the voters polled were white, demonstrating his
cross-over appeal in a state where political allegiances are often
formed partly on the basis of ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
TEXAS
</P>
<P>
Texas Democrats and Republicans are now evenly represented in the
House with 16 seats each. But under a controversial redistricting
plan engineered by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Republicans could
control as many as 22 seats after next week's election.
</P>
<P>
A Republican-redrawing of the election map could cost the Democrats
as many as six House seats including that of longtime Representative
Martin Frost of Dallas, whose district was reconfigured into a
predominately Republican enclave.
</P>
<P>
The US Supreme Court reopened the bitter Texas redistricting feud two
weeks ago by ordering a federal district court to reconsider the
Republican-drawn map, which had been approved earlier by a
three-judge federal panel in Austin.
</P>
<P>
The ruling will have no effect on the November 2 election, although
it may overturn the redistricting plan down the road.

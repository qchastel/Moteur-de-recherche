The United Nations was encouraged by the talks its envoy had with Syria's
president on the Security Council call for Syria to end its involvement in
Lebanon, the U.N. said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. envoy Terje Roed-Larsen met Syrian President Bashar Assad for two hours in
Damascus on Sunday amid accusations that Syria has not withdrawn all its
intelligence agents from Lebanon and was continuing to meddle in Lebanese
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Neither party issued a statement afterward, but the U.N. office in Beirut said
Monday that Larsen's discussions with Assad were "constructive and helpful."
Larsen "will continue working together with President Assad, the Syrian
government, and other parties for the full implementation of Security Council
resolution 1559," the U.N. press release said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted in September last year, calls on Syria to withdraw all
its military from Lebanon and for the disarmament of the Syrian-backed guerrilla
group in Lebanon, Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the Lebanese opposition leader Walid Jumblatt have alleged
that Syria is continuing to maintain intelligence agents in Lebanon, despite its
withdrawal of troops from Lebanon in April. Washington said Syria could even be
involved in recent assassinations in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria has denied the allegations as a smear campaign by Washington and an
attempt to influence the staggered parliamentary elections that are taking place
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. office issued the statement following a meeting between Roed-Larsen and
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Paris during which the secretary general
was briefed on the meeting in Syria. Annan instructed Roed-Larsen last week to
go to Syria to meet Assad for talks on Lebanon.

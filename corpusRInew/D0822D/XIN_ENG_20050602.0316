Syria rejected accusations that it 
was behind the killing of a prominent anti-Syrian Lebanese 
journalist on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"A source at the Information Ministry strongly denounced some 
Lebanese media and political figures who rushed as usual to accuse 
Syria," the official SANA news agency said.
</P>
<P>
"This affirms their pre-determined anti-Syrian stances," the 
source said, accusing them of "seeking to satisfy the enemies of 
Syria, Lebanon and all Arabs in general".
</P>
<P>
Lebanese opposition figures quickly blamed Syria and its 
Lebanese allies for the death of Samir Qaseer, a journalist at 
Lebanon's leading daily An-Nahar, who was killed when a bomb 
exploded in his car earlier in the day in the Lebanese capital of 
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Syria also denied the charge that it was involved in the 
assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri in 
February, which prompted mass pressure on Damascus to withdraw its 
troops from Lebanon in April after 29-year presence.

<P>
Syria is under mounting 
pressure to pull its troops out of Lebanon completely and quickly,
or will face political and economic isolation in the world 
community, The Washington Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ultimatum will be issued to Syria when Terje Roed-Larsen, a
top UN envoy on the Middle East issue, scheduled to meet Syrian 
President Bashar Assad on Saturday, the Post reported, quoting UN 
and US officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UN envoy will tell Assad that Syria will face political and
economic isolation if he does not completely and quickly withdraw 
from Lebanon, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Roed-Larsen plans to inform Syria that the international 
community is united in insisting that Damascus comply with U.N. 
Resolution 1559 -- and is prepared to impose wide punitive 
sanctions if it does not act quickly, the paper quoted officials 
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Over the past weeks, the UN envoy has reportedly met with US, 
European and Arab officials to determine the positions in 
preparation for the diplomatic confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Roed-Larsen, according to the report quoting the UN source as 
saying, will tell the Syrian president to take the following four 
steps.
</P>
<P>
First, Syria must honor the independent sovereignty of Lebanon 
and not undermine its spring elections for a new parliament.
</P>
<P>
Second, Syria must provide a complete timeline for a full 
pullout of its troops.
</P>
<P>
Third, Syria must provide a timeline for the pullout of its 5,
000 intelligence agents in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Roed-Larsen will discuss other requirements in 
Resolution 1559, including the need to disarm and dismantle 
foreign and domestic militias operating in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Since the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq
Hariri on Feb. 14, Syria has been under strong pressure to be out 
of Lebanon completely, though it decided to withdraw its troops to
east part of Lebanon from Beirut.

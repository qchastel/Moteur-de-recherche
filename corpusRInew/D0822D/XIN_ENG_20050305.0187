<P>
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 
on Saturday announced a plan to withdraw troops from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Syrian troops will pull back to Bekaa valley in eastern Lebanon
and then to the Syrian-Lebanese border," Assad told the parliament 
in a speech delivered in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
He said through the move, Syria will fulfill its commitment to 
the Taif Accord and implementing UN Security Council resolution 
1559, which calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops from 
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Taif Accord ended Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
The president said, however, the withdrawal of Syrian troops 
from Lebanon does not mean the absence of a Syrian role in Lebanon,
and the influence of Syria over Lebanon does not depend on the 
deployment of troops.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has a view that the withdrawal is a problem, but this
is the simplest thing. Syria does not reject the principal of 
withdrawal," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to stay in Lebanon," he said, adding that Syrian
troops have begun the pullback process.
</P>
<P>
He also called for boosting bilateral ties through varying 
dimensions -- culture, the economy and education.
</P>
<P>
Syria, a key power broker of Lebanon, has been mounting pressure
to withdraw its 14,000 soldiers from Lebanon since the death of 
former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri last month.

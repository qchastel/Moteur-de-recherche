An official Syrian newspaper on Saturday dismissed as "lies" American
allegations that Syria still maintained troops or intelligence officials in
Lebanon following their full withdrawal in April.
</P>
<P>
"We dare any country or side to come up with evidence that we still have forces
or intelligence (agents) in Lebanon," Tishrin newspaper said in an editorial.
"... Is it Syria's responsibility to maintain security in Lebanon and
Iraq?"
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Thursday Washington was certain that Syrian military
intelligence operatives remain in Lebanon in defiance of international demands
to withdraw all forces and agents.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that Syrian military intelligence agents have stayed
behind, and that they are exerting a highly negative influence on the
situation," a senior U.S. State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Syrian opposition politicians have also claimed that intelligence agents
remain.
</P>
<P>
Syria claims all its forces quit Lebanon in April in line with a U.N. resolution
after some three decades as the dominant political and military force
there.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations verification team is currently in Lebanon to investigate
whether any Syrian intelligence forces remain.
</P>
<P>
Referring to repeated U.S. allegations that Syria was not doing enough to
prevent anti-U.S. fighters from infiltrating into Iraq, Tishrin asked, "What is
really demanded from Syria?"
</P>
<P>
It added that the U.S. accusations were aimed at forcing Syria to change its
stance on the Arab-Israeli conflict and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Indirectly blaming the United States for the instability in the region, the
paper said, "Why doesn't the Bush administration act ... against Israel's
decision to continue the series of assassinations (against Palestinians)?"

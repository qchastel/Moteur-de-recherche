Egypt, Saudi Arabia try to convince Syria to withdraw from Lebanon

<P>
Egypt and Saudi Arabia are trying to persuade Syria to accept a timetable to
withdraw its 15,000 troops from Lebanon, maybe by the end of April, Arab
diplomats said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Calls for Syria's withdrawal, a key demand of Lebanon's anti-Damascus forces,
Washington and the United Nations, have risen to fever pitch since the Feb. 14
assassination of ex-Lebanese premier Rafik Hariri and Monday's resignation of
Lebanon's pro-Damascus government.
</P>
<P>
The Arab diplomats, speaking in Cairo on condition of anonymity, said the
Egyptian-Saudi proposal is based on the 1989 Arab-brokered Taif Accord that
ended Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Syrian troops were sent to Lebanon as part of an Arab peacekeeping force in
1976. The agreement _ secured in the Saudi city of Taif _ called for Syria to
redeploy its troops in Lebanon within two years before a full withdrawal
later.
</P>
<P>
But Syria has not complied with the accord, something which is fanning massive
anti-Damascus discontent in Lebanon, where many blame Syria and the toppled
Lebanese government of involvement in Hariri's killing. Both governments have
denied any role.
</P>
<P>
"The Arabs sent in the Syrians to Lebanon and they can ask them now to pull
out," said one diplomat familiar with the efforts.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and Saudi officials are discussing a formula to persuade Syria to
declare a withdrawal timetable, "possibly as soon as possible," another Arab
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is not to please the United States nor the international
community, but rather to save Syria from a serious conflict that will pitch it
against the whole word," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cairo and Riyadh want to avoid a repeat of their failure to convince toppled
Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to defuse his crisis with the United States before
the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled his regime.
</P>
<P>
The United States and France have been leading calls for Syria to withdraw from
Lebanon. Washington has accused Syria of aiding the anti-U.S. insurgency in
Iraq. It also linked Friday's Tel Aviv suicide bombing to Palestinian Islamic
Jihad militants based in Syria. Damascus has denied the claims.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrians are out of step with where the region is going and out of step with
the aspirations of the people of the Middle East," U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice told reporters while in London for an international conference
on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The latest edition of Time magazine quotes Syrian President Bashar Assad as
saying he would withdraw his troops completely "maybe in the next few months.
Not after that."
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the Time report, Syria appeared to back off the comments. A
Syrian official, speaking on condition of anonymity in Damascus, denied the
magazine's comments that a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon would come within
months, saying the Taif Accord is the basis for this matter.
</P>
<P>
The 1989 accord does not necessarily rule out a full withdrawal within months.
It calls for a redeployment to eastern Lebanon near the border, with a full
pullout subject to negotiation.
</P>
<P>
One of the Arab envoys said Egypt and Saudi Arabia are proposing Syria start an
immediate, token withdrawal with a full pull out completed before the end of
April.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Saudi initiative is expected to be raised during a meeting of Arab
foreign ministers in Cairo late Wednesday ahead of an official meeting Thursday
to prepare for an Arab leadership summit later in the month in
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Cabinet minister Buthaina Shaaban criticized Arab states for indifference
toward American plans "to restructure the area."
</P>
<P>
"What are Arab governments doing in this or that targeted state in this
(American) scheme of change," Shaaban wrote in Monday's edition of London-based
Asharq Al Awsat.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and Saudi officials have not talked publicly about the initiative,
which also calls on Damascus to fully cooperate with an international effort to
investigate Hariri's killing.

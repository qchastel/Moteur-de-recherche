<P>
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili offered Friday to open talks
with one of the candidates in a disputed election in the separatist
region of Abkhazia, but the move was almost instantaneously rejected
as a provocation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before reporters in Tbilisi, Saakashvili said voters in
Abkhazia who supported Sergei Bagapsh to be their leader "are
expressing the will of the majority of the population of Abkhazia. At
this point, there is no alternative to dialogue."
</P>
<P>
But Bagapsh scorned the offer to talk.
</P>
<P>
"He's the last thing I need!" Interfax news agency quoted Bagapsh as
saying of Saakashvili.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian leader's offer of talks "is a provocation aimed at
creating division within Abkhazia and between our republic and
Russia. I have no intention of negotiation with Mr Saakashvili,"
Bagapsh said.
</P>
<P>
Bagapsh was proclaimed winner of an October 3 election in Abkhazia to
choose a new "president" to replace Vladislav Ardzinba, the man who
led the republic's fight to break away from Georgia in the early
1990s. But Ardzinba's anointed successor, Raul Khajimba, also claims
to have won the poll.
</P>
<P>
Both Bagapsh and Khajimba have vowed to consolidate Abkhazia's
declaration of independence, which is recognized officially by no one
although Russia has tacitly supported it.
</P>
<P>
Bagapsh however rose through the ranks of the Georgian Communist
Party during Soviet times, has a Georgian wife and is seen as more
sympathetic to the central Georgian government. He is therefore
doubly eager to prove his credentials as a real Abkhaz nationalist.
</P>
<P>
The youthful Saakashvili, a US-trained lawyer, was elected early this
year and enjoys backing in the West for his campaign to bring
Abkhazia and other wayward parts of Georgia back under central
government control.

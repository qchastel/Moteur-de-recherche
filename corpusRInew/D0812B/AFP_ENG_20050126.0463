President Mikhail Saakashvili of 
Georgia, seeking to reunite his country, Wednesday offered autonomy 
to the separatist republic of South Ossetia but the offer was 
immediately rejected by the Ossetian leadership.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling how he plans to keep his election campaign vow and 
reunited fractured Georgia, Saakashvili told European 
parliamentarians that he was willing to give more independence to 
separatist regions, as long as Georgia remained whole.
</P>
<P>
But South Ossetia's leader Eduard Kokoity said in Moscow that "I 
see our future in Russia."
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili said in a speech at the Council of Europe that 
autonomy would comprise "the right for a local government elected 
freely and directly that would include an executive branch and a 
parliament."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Moscow, Kokoity said 95 percent of the breakaway 
republic's inhabitants have Russian citizenship, and that "for 
several years now we have lived by following Russian legislation." 
he said.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili did not raise the issue of Abkhazia, another 
separatist republic, which fought a civil war against Georgia, a 
former Soviet republic, with the help of Russian mercenaries in the 
1990s.
</P>
<P>
He said talks with the republic, which is a de facto Russian 
protectorate, "would be of no use" sin`ce the Abkhazian leadership 
"walked out of the negotiations" and there was noone with whom to 
deal on the other side.
</P>
<P>
South Ossetia also fought a brief war against Georgia in the 
early 1990s. Moscow has sent peacekeeping troops to the region and 
has granted most of the region's ethnic Ossetian residents Russian 
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Brought to power by a peaceful "rose revolution" one year ago, 
Saakashvili has set reuniting his country as his most urgent 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
He said that that as far as South Ossetia was concerned, the 
possibilities he outlined were realistic. He urged the local 
population there to prompt their politicians to accept the plan.

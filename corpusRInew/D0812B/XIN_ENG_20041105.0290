Georgia and its pro-independence region of South Ossetia Friday
agreed to withdraw troops from conflict areas at a bilateral meeting
held in Russia's black sea resort of Sochi, said reports reaching
here.
</P>

Georgian Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania and South Ossetian leader
Eduard Kokoity agreed that all the armed forces, but the peace-
keepers by the two sides and Russia and some police, would be pulled
out of the conflict zone.

<P>
The agreement was reached under the mediation of the Russian Foreign
Ministry.

Topics discussed during the meeting also included resuming rail
transportation between Georgian capital Tbilisi and South Ossetian
capital Tskhinvali.

Zhvania said the talks would promote dialogues between the two sides
and ensure a territorial integrity for Georgia.

Kokoity, for his part, said he hoped the agreement, which would help
stabilize the region, would be successfully implemented.

South Ossetia proclaimed its independence after the former Soviet
Union broke up and then fought a war with Georgia's government forces
in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
To end the conflict, Russia, Georgia, South and North Ossetia set up
a joint supervision committee in 1992, and a tripartite security
force by the Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia was sent to the
conflict region.
</P>
<P>
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, who took office in January,
has vowed to reunify the country by bringing South Ossetia and
Abkhazia back under Tbilisi's control.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Tbilisi and South Ossetia have heightened since late
May this year when Saakashvili briefly sent troops into the region.

<P>
A temporary calm was brought by a bilateral cease-fire agreement
signed on Aug. 15 in the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali.

US calls for return to talks between Georgia, Abkhazia

WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP)

<TEXT>
<P>
The United States called Monday for a resumption in talks to end the
conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia but made clear it recognized
neither the independence of the breakaway Georgian region nor the
legitimacy of its weekend elections.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said it had no comment on the result of Sunday's
poll contested between five pro-independence candidates and would
take no position on claims of fraud and irregularities from the
presumptive favorite, Raul Khajimba.
</P>
<P>
Instead, deputy spokesman Adam Ereli said that Washington wanted
whoever emerges as the new "president" of Abkhazia to resume talks
with Georgian authorities.
</P>
<P>
"The United States does not recognize Abkhazia as an independent
state, so I don't really have any comment on these elections," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is to support an international approach to a peaceful
resolution of the Abkhaz conflict that respects Georgia's sovereignty
and territorial integrity and whatever leadership is in Abkhazia, we
would hope that it returns to negotiations toward that end in the
near future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The identity of Abkhazia's next chief matters because the picturesque
enclave on the Black Sea coast is seen as a potential flashpoint
between Georgia's pro-Western leaders and Moscow, which has given its
tacit support to the Abkhaz separatists.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election was the first competetive vote in Abkhazia since
the republic declared its independence from Georgia after winning a
war 11 years ago, and was held up as proof of its democratic
credentials and internal stability.
</P>
<P>
The conflict cost about 10,000 lives and created hundreds of
thousands of refugees, most of them ethnic Georgians who were forced
to flee Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Fears of a new conflict have resurfaced though, since Mikhail
Saakashvili, a tough-talking US-trained lawyer backed by Washington,
was swept to power in Tbilisi late last year in a bloodless
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili has said he will not rest until Georgia's wayward regions
-- South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- are back under Tbilisi's control.
</P>
<P>
This summer he announced Georgian warships would sink any vessels
carrying tourists from Russia to resorts in Abkhazia. That provoked a
furious war of words with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Renewed fighting over Abkhazia would destabilize a south Caucasus
region which is soon to become a strategic gateway for oil exports
from the Caspian Sea to Western markets.

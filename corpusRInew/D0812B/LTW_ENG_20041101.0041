Georgians Grow Impatient With New Regime

TBILISI, Georgia

<P>
The old white Zhiguli fairly flew down the
highway, skimming precariously over the potholes as Garri Nersesov
clutched the wheel and declared victory in the war on corruption.
</P>
<P>
``There's no police!'' he proclaimed, waving a hand -- when he
mustered the nerve to take it off the wheel -- toward the empty
roadside. ``It used to be, you had a policeman sitting under every
bush. I could never drive this fast. . . . They would stop you and rob
you!''
</P>
<P>
Score one taxi driver on the side of President Mikheil
Saakashvili's drive to end the tyranny of Georgia's notoriously
corrupt street cops. Half the nation's police force -- nearly 15,000
officers -- was fired earlier this year. Those remaining got jaunty,
American-style police uniforms, new Volkswagen Passats and salaries
high enough to help resist the urge to collect on-the-spot traffic
fines.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili was elected after Georgians flooded the streets last
November and ousted President Eduard A. Shevardnadze in an uprising
known as the ``Rose Revolution.'' In less than a year, Saakashvili has
succeeded in slashing the state bureaucracy by 35 percent, wresting
back the breakaway region of Adzharia, raising pensions and nearly
doubling the nation's tax and customs revenues.
</P>
<P>
But the brash 36-year-old with the boyish, pudgy cheeks and a
Columbia University law degree also has engaged in some brinkmanship
with neighboring Russia. He is finding it increasingly difficult to
convince his constituents and the world that the dysfunctional
Caucasian backwater he inherited can be transformed overnight into a
prosperous democracy by the force of his own audacious determination.
</P>
<P>
Disappointment fueled by impatience is on the rise. Almost daily,
protesters take to the streets over low wages and the sale of
state-owned factories to companies abroad. Moreover, the government --
which swept to power under the banner of democracy -- faces challenges
to its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Police have broken up at least three demonstrations since July and
jailed a former state audit official who was allegedly tortured after
his arrest. In the town of Gori, a respected newspaper editor who
published articles critical of the Saakashvili-appointed governor was
arrested. He says a packet of drugs was shoved into his pocket.
</P>
<P>
For many, disillusionment with the new Georgia is as simple as
being as poor now as they were a year ago. Worse, prices have
escalated sharply in the last few months, and many worry that
Saakashvili's tough talk against Russia has hurt their chances to sell
goods there.
</P>
<P>
``It's . . . bad,'' said Yuri Koloskov, a 57-year-old shoe
repairman who was an engineer before the collapse of the Soviet Union
and Georgia's subsequent independence. ``Whatever he promised us, he
delivered nothing. I'm not against being friendly with America, but we
mustn't forget that ordinary people need a market to sell their stuff,
and our market is Russia. As long as we have tense relations with
Russia, we'll see nothing here.''
</P>
<P>
Gyorgy Dzhangidze, a college economics student, said he and his
friends didn't expect to find a job paying more than $400 a month.
``We were fighting for him in Rustaveli Street. And it's not that he
failed us,'' he said. ``But we didn't see the results we expected.''
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili's team, many of them also young, U.S.-educated
professionals, said they realized their time to turn the country
around was short.
</P>
<P>
``We understand now that the honeymoon is over. We realize every
single day how hard it is to run a small country in this part of the
world,'' said Georgia's national security adviser, Gela Bezhuashvili.
``The revolution gave people hope, but nobody talked to them about
what democracy is, what independence is, how much it costs.''
</P>
<P>
After his stunning electoral victory in January with 96 percent of
the vote, Saakashvili dismissed several ministers and other senior
officials suspected of corruption and declared his intention to end
the de facto secession of the pro-Russian regions of Adzharia,
Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
</P>
<P>
By May, the young president had sent Adzharia's feisty strongman,
Aslan Abashidze, packing to Moscow; in the process, he regained access
to the busy Black Sea port at Batumi and its millions of dollars in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
Next, Saakashvili set his sights on Abkhazia and South Ossetia,
virtually independent since conflicts frozen in the early 1990s.
There, he hit a brick wall -- entrenched Russian support and a
population viscerally opposed to union with Georgia quickly ignited
new conflict.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen Georgian soldiers died in clashes in South Ossetia after
Saakashvili closed down a booming $20-million annual trade in Russian
goods smuggled through the lawless region. In Abkhazia, where
thousands of Russian tourists spend their summers at low-budget Black
Sea resorts, Saakashvili threatened to sink Russian tour boats.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been doing its own share of blustering. After the
terrorist seizure of a school at Beslan, Moscow declared that it was
prepared to launch pre-emptive strikes against terrorist refuges. In
view of Russia's frequent complaints that Georgia shields Chechen
rebels in the remote Pankisi Gorge, most took the declaration as a
thinly veiled threat to bomb Georgia.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The newly assertive Georgian president clearly has Moscow worried.
</P>
<P>
``He is extremely popular, and while he is popular, he fancies
himself invincible. He destabilizes the situation with his simplistic
moves . . .,'' Gleb Pavlovsky, an analyst close to the Kremlin, told
the Russian newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. ``It means that Russia will
have to stop this man sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The prospect of a new war in the Caucasus would provoke unease in
the United States, which last year spent $20 million on
democracy-building programs in Georgia and is Saakashvili's biggest
international booster.
</P>
<P>
At home, Saakashvili still enjoys a confidence rating of more than
80 percent, according to a poll two months ago by the GORBI
Sociological Survey, and many Georgians say they are proud of their
tough new president.
</P>
<P>
``Of course we support him. One hundred and fifty percent,'' said
Lasha Chechua, an unemployed gas industry engineer.
</P>
<P>
``If he needs to go to war in South Ossetia, people must understand
that this is Georgia's territory, and this whole conflict was created
by a third party, Russia.''
</P>
<P>
``We're up to our ears in debt,'' his wife, Tsetsino, said.
</P>
<P>
``But that's not Saakashvili's fault. Everything was destroyed when
he came to power. There was nothing. Now, we need time. He needs
time.''
</P>
<P>
Yet how much time is required to turn around a nation with 17
percent unemployment, falling living standards and an industrial
output barely a quarter of what it was in 1991?
</P>
<P>
For some of those who stood with Saakashvili last November
demanding a more accountable government, there is a sense of urgency
-- the new government, they say, must be held to its commitment to
democracy, before the authoritarian habits that are so entrenched in
most post-Soviet republics are allowed to slip in.
</P>
<P>
A Tbilisi organization, Former Political Prisoners for Human
Rights, has compiled 72 cases of beatings of prisoners and other
police abuses since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
``The right to freely express yourself no longer exists. People
have been thrown into prisons for participating in mass rallies,''
said Nana Kakabadze, head of the prisoners group.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``I think we are on the right road. We want to build a good,
strong, free, democratic state,'' said the deputy speaker of
Parliament, Mikheil Machavariani. ``Our partners are helping us with
this, and our neighbors in Russia are very jealous of this
relationship with the United States, probably because they love us so
much.
</P>
<P>
''But they love us as a little brother, and we are not little
brothers. We want to be equal partners in a big family.``

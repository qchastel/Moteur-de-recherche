<P>
Twelve residents of Georgia's separatist 
republic of South Ossetia were abducted Saturday by kidnappers 
seeking the release of a Georgian police officer seized three days 
earlier in the region, authorities in Tbilisi and in South Ossetia 
said.
</P>
<P>
One of the 12, identified as Makhar Gassyev, a member of the 
South Ossetia's self-declared "government", was released later in 
the day, according to pictures shown on Georgian television.
</P>
<P>
The 12 were seized in Ergneti, near the border between South 
Ossetia and the rest of Georgia, by kidnappers demanding the release 
of policeman Lado Chalauri.
</P>
<P>
Chalauri and another Georgian policeman, Gochi Gvimradze, were 
kidnapped Wednesday night, also in Ergneti, but Gvimradze was later 
released following negotiations.

<P>
"We will do all we can to prevent an escalation of violence from 
taking place. But Georgian authorities will never exchange the 
Georgian policeman for the Ossetian delinquents," said the head of 
Georgia's National Security Council, Guela Bejouachvili.
</P>
<P>
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili was to attend an 
emergency meeting of the national security council to discuss the 
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We will not release the hostages until the Georgian policeman 
is freed," one of the kidnappers told Georgian television. 
"Otherwise, we will block all roads leading to Tskhinvali," the 
major city of South Ossetia, "and we will keep hold of the 
hostages."
</P>
<P>
Russia's foreign ministry Saturday demanded the release of the 
12 hostages, warning in a statement of "escalation of the conflict" 
between Tblisi and South Ossetia.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the Georgian border region of Chida Kartli, 
Mikhail Kareli, said Thursday that the abduction of the two officers 
was designed to disrupt peace talks with the separatist region.
</P>
<P>
On January 12 Saakashvili said he would present official 
proposals to the separatist and Russian-backed territories of South 
Ossetia and Abkhazia by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia fought a civil war against Georgia with the help of 
Russian mercenaries in the 1990s, and it remains a de facto Russian 
protectorate. Both the government and the opposition reject its 
incorporation into Georgia.
</P>
<P>
South Ossetia also fought a brief war with Tbilisi in the early 
1990s. Moscow has sent peacekeeping troops to the region and has 
granted most of the region's ethnic Ossetian residents Russian 
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Brought to power by a peaceful "rose revolution" one year ago, 
Saakashvili has set reuniting his country as his most urgent 
priority.

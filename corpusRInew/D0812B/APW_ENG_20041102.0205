Georgia accuses Russia of interfering in Abkhazia

<P>
Georgia on Tuesday accused Russia of interfering in its internal
affairs, citing a visit to Moscow by two rival presidential
candidates in the breakaway Georgian province of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Former Abkhazian Prime Minister Raul Khadzhimba and his challenger,
opposition leader Sergei Bagapsh, arrived in Moscow on Monday to meet
with Russian officials and discuss the fiercely contested
presidential vote in Abkhazia, Russian and Abkhazian media reported.
</P>
<P>
"Just as it has been for the last 10 years, who will become the next
leader will be decided in Russia," Georgy Khaindrava, Georgia's
minister for conflict settlement, said at a Moscow news conference,
according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia, which has enjoyed de facto independence since Georgian
troops were driven from the region 1993, has been in turmoil after
its first contested presidential vote on Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazian election officials said that opposition leader Sergei
Bagapsh won the vote, and the region's highest court later confirmed
it. But hours after issuing the verdict, the court overturned the
ruling when hundreds of supporters of Bagapsh's rival, ex-Prime
Minister Raul Khadzhimba, broke into the court building.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing President Vladislav Ardzinba, who supported Khadzhimba, then
ordered a new election _ a decision Bagapsh has refused to recognize.
</P>
<P>
Georgian parliament speaker Nino Burdzhanadze, also visiting Moscow,
made similar accusations about Russian meddling. She said Georgia was
mulling over withdrawing from the Commonwealth of Independent States,
a group uniting 12 former Soviet republics, which she called
"inefficient," the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. She indicated that
no final decision had been made.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia and another separatist province of Georgia, South Ossetia,
have cultivated close ties with Russia. Tensions have escalated
between Tbilisi and the two provinces _ as well as Russia _ after
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili vowed to bring the regions
back under central control.
</P>
<P>
Burdzhanadze criticized Russia for unilaterally handing out Russian
passports to citizens in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's clear to everyone that the granting of Russian
citizenship is being used for a single reason: to be able to say that
Russia has the right to interfere in these conflicts because many
Russian residents reside there," Interfax quoted her as saying.

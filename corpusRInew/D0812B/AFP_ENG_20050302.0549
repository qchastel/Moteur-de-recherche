Mikhail Saakashivili, the pro-Western 
leader of Georgia who came to power last year after leading a 
popular revolt against a Soviet-era regime, visited Moldova 
Wednesday ahead of key legislative elections and denounced 
separatism in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili and Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin held talks 
here and afterwards issued a joint declaration in which both leaders 
criticized separatist movements in their own ex-Soviet republics and 
elsewhere in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"Separatist leaders have created an international criminal 
alliance," Saakashvili told reporters after meeting Voronin.
</P>
<P>
He accused the leader of Moldova's pro-Russian breakaway region 
of Transdniestr of helping supply weapons to pro-Russian separatist 
forces in Georgia's regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and 
described separatism as a source of crime, smuggling and general 
lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
"There is a link between our countries," Saakashvili said, 
referring to Georgia and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
"It is the link of countries that have a shared European history 
and that aspire to a shared future in a united Europe where there is 
no place for separatism, lawlessness and crime," the Georgian leader 
said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was imperative that Sunday's legislative elections in 
Moldova were democratic, saying "very much depends" on the the 
conduct of the vote.
</P>
<P>
If the elections were peaceful and democratic then Moldova "will 
enter an entirely new phase" of its political development since the 
breakup of the Soviet Union, he said.
</P>
<P>
Voronin, who on Tuesday paid a suprise visit to Ukraine's 
President Viktor Yushchenko, another pro-Western leader who recently 
led a popular revolt against a Soviet-era regime, agreed with 
Saakashvili.
</P>
<P>
In the joint declaration he and Saakashvili signed, "we called 
things by their real names," he said, adding: "We concluded that 
separatist republics are a 'black hole' where chaos rules. And we 
stated our determination to join forces to resolve these problems," 
the Moldovan leader said.
</P>
<P>
Voronin's Communist Party is expected to hold on to power that 
it assumed during the last parliamentary polls in 2001.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Russian daily Kommersant published 
Tuesday, Voronin said he feared fraud will mar Sunday's polls and 
warned against "provocations" in Transdniestr.
</P>
<P>
He said he also had word of a Russian-inspired plot against 
him.

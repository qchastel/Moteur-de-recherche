Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili 
said Wednesday he would present official proposals to separatist 
territories Abkhazia and South Ossetia by the end of this month, 
hoping that the people -- if not the Russian-backed self-proclaimed 
governments -- will listen.
</P>
<P>
He told the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta, "we do not expect a 
quick, favorable reaction from the self-proclaimed governments, 
above all in Abkhazia," where voters were electing a new 
administration Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"But we do count very much on the reaction of ordinary people, 
who understand perfectly well that it is impossible to live for long 
in a beseiged fortress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to find a common denominator, an understanding. 
In the present circumstances, we are all losers."
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia fought a civil war against Georgia with the help of 
Russian mercenaries in the 1990s, and it remains a de facto Russian 
protectorate. Both the government and the opposition reject its 
incorporation into Georgia.
</P>
<P>
South Ossetia, also protected by Russia, has declared itself 
independent, although no country has recognized it. 
</P>
<P>
Brought to power by a peaceful "rose revolution" a year ago, 
Saakashvili has said that reuniting his country is his most urgent 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
He told the newspaper that he seeks good relations with Moscow 
and does not wish to be involved in any dispute between Russia and 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
He said that if the Russians had shown good will, the problem of 
South Ossetia would be solved already, while that of Abkhazia would 
have made "important progress" toward a solution.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili said he hoped to finalise a framework agreement on 
relations between his country and Russia during a meeting with 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Tbilisi next month, and to 
sign a definitive agreement with President Vladimir Putin later in 
the year.
</P>
<P>
He said he enjoyed good personal relations with Putin, and that 
the Russian leader was always welcome to visit Georgia.

After a year, Georgia's government records success, but new concerns as well

<P>
The Hotel Iveria, a Soviet-era showpiece on prime Tbilisi real estate, is an
empty hulk, the wind whistling through its glassless windows. For Georgia,
that's a sign of progress.
</P>
<P>
For the past decade, the 20-story hotel on the capital's main avenue, commanding
a stunning vista of mountains and valleys, had been a slum with a view: It was
jammed with more than 1,000 refugees from one of the separatist wars that keep
the Caucasus region in sporadic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Then a developer bought the refugees out for US$7,000 (euro5,485) a room in
order to redevelop the hotel for the upmarket guest trade. But many refugees
complained the payoff wouldn't buy them suitable replacement
housing.
</P>
<P>
One problem dispensed with, another created. It's a pattern characterizing much
of Georgia's effort to pull itself out of the abyss of poverty and corruption it
had plunged into under longtime leader Eduard Shevardnadze, who was ousted in
the "Rose Revolution" protests of November 2003. His reform-oriented successor,
Mikhail Saakashvili, was inaugurated on Jan. 25, 2004.
</P>
<P>
Now comes the death of Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania, who had been in office
slightly less than a year when he succumbed to apparent carbon-monoxide
poisoning by a faulty space heater, and new anxieties have arisen about
Georgia's prospects for real change.
</P>
<P>
What would seem a preposterous way for a high-ranking official to die in a
developed country doesn't necessarily seem far-fetched in Tbilisi, where the
central heating system has been out for a decade. But neither is the official
explanation entirely accepted by Georgians. It reflects the lingering distrust
of a government many of whose members served under Shevardnadze, says Georgian
political analyst Davit Usupashvili.
</P>
<P>
Some of the transformations over the past year have been unambiguously positive:
long-delayed salaries for teachers and civil servants have been paid, highways
once infamous for wheel-eating potholes are under repair, military restructuring
has boosted the once-ragged armed forces' confidence.
</P>
<P>
"They've accomplished a remarkable amount," U.S. Ambassador Richard Miles said
of the government's moves, adding praise of moves to purge government agencies
of unproductive bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
Some other moves are a matter of going forward at an oblique tack. Georgia and
Russia have agreed to restore rail links, severed since the conflict over
Georgia's breakaway northwest region of Abkhazia. But with Abkhazia still
refusing to countenance possible reintegration into Georgia, the trains will
skirt Abkhazia by taking to the Black Sea on ferries.
</P>
<P>
Initial satisfaction over a series of well-publicized arrests in a war on
corruption and criminal gangs darkened after many of those arrested were allowed
to avoid prison terms by refunding what they allegedly stole.
</P>
<P>
The practice was censured this year by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council
of Europe, the continent's top human rights body, dealing a blow to the respect
widely accorded to Saakashvili's reformist government.
</P>
<P>
"The government should say an absolute 'no' to the absolute abuse of power,"
said analyst Usupashvili.
</P>
<P>
But Miles said one could argue that the system has its merits, especially given
the still-shaky court system.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't fit exactly with the rule of law," the ambassador said, but added
that it may work better than submitting cases to "a judicial process that might
or might not prove successful."
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia isn't the only restive corner of this South Carolina-sized country of 5
million. Adzharia and South Ossetia have also proved problematic.
</P>
<P>
One of the new government's most notable early successes was reasserting control
over Adzharia, an autonomous region whose feudal-style leader, Aslan Abashidze,
had defied Tbilisi and withheld tax revenues for years.
</P>
<P>
Abashidze's decision to blow up bridges into Adzharia, supposedly to forestall a
Georgian invasion, galvanized Adzharians' long-simmering dissatisfaction with
him. But although Abashidze essentially drove himself out of office, his
downfall appeared to make the Georgian authorities confident that South Ossetia
could be brought to heel just as easily.
</P>
<P>
Instead, South Ossetian and Georgian forces launched into a brief but intense
spasm of fighting, and South Ossetia is now figuring in the rumors and
conspiracy theories surrounding the strange death of Prime Minister
Zhvania.
</P>
<P>
Zhvania had been pushing for a negotiated settlement, which could include an
offer of autonomy apparently similar to that in Adzharia which so irritated
Tbilisi. Some have claimed to see the hand of Georgia's giant neighbor, Russia,
which has powerful interests in a neighbor that also is close to oil fields, and
abuts both war-torn Chechnya and NATO member Turkey. The Kremlin has sharply
dismissed these suspicions.
</P>
<P>
Georgian officials, while insisting Zhvania's death was an accident, have
brought in the FBI to investigate.
</P>
<P>
Usupashvili, the analyst, declined to say whether he believed the official
explanation for Zhvania's death but noted that the authorities who made it "are
well-known for signing false statements in the past."

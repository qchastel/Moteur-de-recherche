Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, 
attending a major military parade celebrating independence Thursday, 
called on two separatist regions in the ex-Soviet republic to end 
their isolation and reunite.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of a march past by 10,000 soldiers through 
the centre of the capital Tbilisi, Saakashvili told the people of 
Abkhazia, on the Black Sea coast, and South Ossetia, at the foot of 
the Caucasus mountains, that their future lay within Georgia.

<P>
"Nothing separates us. All that we have, including this army, is 
also yours. The time of isolation is over. We must live together," 
Saakashvili said.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili said Georgia would only "be fully free" when 
independence day celebrations also took place in Sukhumi, capital of 
Abkhazia, which like South Ossetia ousted Georgian authorities in 
separatist wars in the early 1990s after the Soviet collapse. "I 
promise you that will happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili, who came to power in the "rose revolution" of 2003, 
has made reuniting Georgia a central theme of his presidency. 
However, the Russian-backed rebel leaderships in Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia are adamant that they are independent from Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
Georgia's army is widely considered too small and poorly trained 
to retake either region by force, although units being trained by US 
military advisors were prominent in the Tbilisi parade.
</P>
<P>
Georgian officials frequently complain about Russian support for 
the separatist republics. Saakashvili said in his speech that he 
wanted "friendly, but equal relations" with Moscow.

Saakashvili powers on one year after 'rose revolution' by Adele Brard

<P>
One year ago, Mikhail Saakashvili led massive street protests that
toppled the old regime in Georgia, promising to transform this
impoverished former Soviet republic into a modern state.
</P>
<P>
Today Saakashvili has retained overwhelming support in this strategic
Caucasus nation, over which Russia and the United States are vying
for influence, even though many of Georgia's problems -- corruption,
economic malaise, separatism -- remain.
</P>
<P>
After leading the "rose revolution" that forced longtime leader
Eduard Shevardnadze to resign on November 23, Saakashvili easily
swept to the presidency on a wave of hope that this onetime
prosperous republic could climb out of the poverty where it had
wallowed since the Soviet Union's collapse.
</P>
<P>
Support for the 36-year-old US-educated lawyer may not be as fervent
as a year ago, but it remains strong -- his job approval rating
currently is 86 percent, compared with 90 percent last February
following his inauguration, according to a poll released last week by
the Gorbi polling agency.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a hard year for me, but I still think that Saakashvili is
the best president Georgia could ever have now, especially after
Shevardnadze," said Nino Aznaurashvili, a 26-year-old former
government worker.
</P>
<P>
The tall polyglot -- Saakashvili speaks fluent English and French, in
addition to Georgian, Russian and Ukrainian -- admits that his
reforms have a way to go.
</P>
<P>
"When we started, this country didn't look like a state, we did
everything from scratch," he said in an interview last week. "It's a
long way before (the benefits) get to the ordinary people."
</P>
<P>
The major challenges facing Saakashvili have not changed --
corruption, an economy largely unreformed since Soviet times, and
separatism.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili's aggressive fight against corruption, under which former
top officials have been forced to pay back large sums to avoid
imprisonment, has raised eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
"The anti-corruption campaign is selective, it depends on the
personal will of the president and not on the law," says Levan
Berdzenishvili, an opposition deputy. Saakashvili denies the charge.
</P>
<P>
Georgians have nearly all welcomed the disbandment of the notoriously
corrupt traffic police, the bane of every driver, and its replacement
by a small, well-paid force modelled on the US highway patrol.
</P>
<P>
Separatism remains one of Saakashvili's biggest challenges -- though
Saakashvili succeeded in bringing the semi-autonomous Adjara region
under central control, separatist Abkhazia and South Ossetia show no
intention of following suit.
</P>
<P>
At least 17 Georgian soldiers were killed this summer in clashes with
South Ossetian forces, raising tensions to fever pitch in the rebel
territory, which like Abkhazia declared independence following a
civil war in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"The operation in South Ossetia was a total defeat. Trust built up
over years was destroyed by Saakashvili's lack of strategy," said
Georgi Tarkhan-Muravi of the Institute for Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
But Saakashvili remains upbeat. "I am confident that Abkhazia and
South Ossetia will return to Georgia within the next five years," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Relations with Russia, the traditional power broker in the region
which backs the separatists, have taken a turn for the worse as a
result of the anti-separatist drive.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, several important reforms are underway in
areas including education and tax, and big efforts have been made to
cut the layers of bureaucracy inherited from the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the systematic replacement of professionals by young
people who are often unqualified is one of the most serious problems
created by the new government," says one opposition deputy.
</P>
<P>
While pensions have gone up by two dollars per month, inflation
estimated at 10 percent has eroded the purchasing power of the
population.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili, who has named an ethnic Georgian oligarch from Russia as
his economy minister, has put emphasis on privatization and reforming
the tax code in economic reforms and remains confident of their
effect.
</P>
<P>
"Next elections are in almost four years' time," Saakashvili said.
"That's exactly when we should start to get a return from reforms."

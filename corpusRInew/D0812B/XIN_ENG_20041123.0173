Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili vowed Tuesday to step up
preparations to defend Georgia's territorial integrity and restore
control over Abkhazia, according to the Interfax.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from the Georgian capital of Tbilisi said that
Saakashvili promised to solve the Abkhazia issue either through
negotiations or by use of state power. But he added that Tbilisi is
not prepared to start a war.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili said that some countries are not willing to see a strong
Georgia or satisfied with Georgia's control over Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Last Week, the Abkhazian authorities claimed that Georgia has
mobilized 700 troops along the administrative border of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Georgia's Defense Ministry refuted the above allegation,
saying that all the accusations by the Abkhazian authorities were not
true and were made up by some people in the Abkhazian republic trying
to divert people's attention.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia, bordering with southern Russia, announced independence in
1992, which was not recognized by any country.
</P>
<P>
In July, the Abkhazian authorities announced its withdrawal from the
negotiations with the Georgian government after Georgian coast guards
fired at a Turkish ship in the Abkhazian waters.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the republic has been tense after two presidential
candidates disputed over the results of the elections held on Oct. 3.

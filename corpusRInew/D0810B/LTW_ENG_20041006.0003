Fannie Executives to Defend Accounting Practices
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
In their first public response to regulators'
allegations that the company manipulated its books, executives of
mortgage funding giant Fannie Mae plan to defend its accounting and
say the actions regulators have criticized involve interpretations of
complicated rules.
</P>
<P>
``These accounting standards are highly complex and require
determinations over which experts often disagree,'' Fannie Mae
chairman and chief executive Franklin Raines says in written testimony
prepared for delivery at a congressional hearing Wednesday and made
available to The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Some of the regulators' findings ``involve highly detailed issues
that I would not normally focus on in my role as CEO,'' Raines says.
</P>
<P>
Raines says the company strongly disagrees with the allegation that
it willfully violated accounting rules to maximize executive bonuses
in 1998, according to the testimony.
</P>
<P>
``What we want to demonstrate is that we intended to do the right
thing and we took care to do the right thing,'' Raines says.
</P>
<P>
Some of the accounting involved inherently imprecise estimates of
the way consumers would respond to changes in interest rates, Raines
says. ``Given these imprecisions, Fannie Mae decided to use a range of
possible outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
In a report last month, regulators said Fannie manipulated its
accounting to present a stable pattern of earnings and tolerated weak
internal controls to obscure manipulations. In 1998, regulators
alleged, Fannie improperly delayed booking $200 million of expenses,
enabling Raines and other top executives to receive their maximum
bonuses, a total of $27.1 million.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of policy, Fannie allowed itself considerable
discretion to postpone some of its income or expenses each fiscal
quarter, the regulators said.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, Fannie's
primary regulator, blamed Fannie's corporate culture and questioned
the ability of Fannie's management to correct the problems. The agency
accused Chief Financial Officer J. Timothy Howard of providing
inadequate oversight and wearing multiple hats that contributed to a
breakdown of checks and balances.
</P>
<P>
Along with presiding director Ann McLaughlin Korologos and OFHEO
Director Armando Falcon Jr., Raines and Howard are scheduled to
testify Wednesday before the House capital markets subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
In prepared testimony, Howard says he believed Fannie's accounting
was within the rules. ``All of my judgments regarding accounting
issues were made in openness and good faith, with the goal of
providing investors with the most meaningful and understandable
information possible,'' Howard says.
</P>
<P>
Raines' testimony says Fannie's auditor, KPMG LLP, concurred with
Fannie's accounting and has not withdrawn its support. He says that
before he certified the financial statements, they were reviewed by
dozens of people inside the company.
</P>
<P>
Fannie faces investigations by the Justice Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission and litigation by shareholders. In
an agreement with OFHEO, it committed to change its accounting methods
going forward. Whether it must also correct its past financial
statements will be determined by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
For Raines and Howard, the stakes go beyond keeping their jobs.
Executives can face fines and prison for knowingly or willfully
certifying false financial statements, and they can be compelled to
give back incentive pay and gains from stock sales if past financial
statements require correction.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, against the backdrop of the accounting scandal at Enron
Corp., Raines appeared before the committee as a spokesman for the
cause of good corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
``It is wholly irresponsible and unacceptable for corporate leaders
to say they did not know or suggest it was not their duty to know
about the operations and activities of their company,'' Raines
testified on behalf of the Business Roundtable, a group of chief
executives of large corporations.
</P>
<P>
In prepared testimony, Falcon tells a different story: ``Fannie
understood the rules and simply chose not to follow them.''
</P>
<P>
Falcon also says that auditor KPMG disagreed with Fannie Mae on the
1998 accounting that enabled executives to collect full bonuses
instead of none.

Regulators May Try to Oust Fannie Mae Execs

Fannie Mae's regulators would take steps to oust top
executives, including chairman and chief executive Franklin Raines and
Chief Financial Officer J. Timothy Howard, if the board of the
government-chartered mortgage funding company doesn't remove them on
its own, according to a source close to the situation.
</P>
<P>
With Fannie Mae preparing to make accounting corrections that could
negate $9 billion of its profit since 2001, board members convened by
telephone Thursday for more than an hour, but no actions were taken,
said sources who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity
of the ongoing deliberations. The board planned to meet again as early
as this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Company spokeswoman Janice Daue declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
Raines' long-standing and energetic defense of Fannie's accounting
practices crumbled Wednesday night when, at the behest of the top
accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company
agreed to correct past financial reports.
</P>
<P>
At an October congressional hearing on the company's accounting,
Raines said the buck would stop with him if Fannie was found in error.
</P>
<P>
``I've always tried my best to ensure that our company does the
right thing in the right way,'' Raines told lawmakers. ``If, however,
after a thorough review of all the facts, it is determined that our
company made significant mistakes, our board and our shareholders will
hold me accountable. And I'll hold myself accountable.''
</P>
<P>
Fannie's primary regulator, the Office of Federal Housing
Enterprise Oversight, had expressed doubts about the company's
management in September, when it issued a report alleging that Fannie
had ignored accounting rules it didn't like and manipulated estimates
to achieve desired financial results. OFHEO last year forced the
ouster of top executives at Fannie's direct competitor, Freddie Mac,
amid similar accounting problems.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, OFHEO spokeswoman Corinne Russell said the agency was
working with Fannie Mae to address the impact the SEC-directed
correction would have on the company's financial position ``and on
other areas within our responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
The correction could require Fannie to record $9 billion of losses
from financial contracts known as derivatives -- the net of $13.5
billion of losses and $4.5 billion of gains that the company had
excluded from past earnings. That would leave Fannie with less than
the minimum level of capital it must hold in reserve as a cushion
against financial setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Because the SEC backed OFHEO's key findings on Fannie's accounting,
the Justice Department will continue its ongoing investigation into
whether top Fannie Mae executives manipulated earnings to trigger
multimillion-dollar bonuses for themselves, a source said.
</P>
<P>
Former senator Warren Rudman, a Republican from New Hampshire who
is leading an investigation of the regulators' allegations for
Fannie's board, said in an interview that that review is ``progressing
with a lot of intensity and a lot of resources.''
</P>
<P>
The company remains under investigation by the SEC, the Justice
Department and OFHEO, which is examining additional accounting issues.
</P>
<P>
Fannie's stock fell $1.39 Thursday, to $69.30. In the bond market,
news of the planned accounting correction had ``a noticeable but
minimal effect'' on Fannie Mae's borrowing costs, increasing them
slightly compared with those of Freddie Mac, said Walter Schmidt, who
manages mortgage strategy and research at FTN Financial Capital
Markets in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Over the long run, Fannie's need to shore up its capital could put
upward pressure on mortgage rates, but ``by how much it's very
difficult to say,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
Fannie borrows money by issuing bonds and uses those funds to buy
mortgages from lenders, thereby giving them cash to make more loans.
The accounting correction could lead Fannie to sell off a chunk of the
more than $900 billion of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities it
holds, said Jay Brinkman, vice president for research and economics at
the Mortgage Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
While the company kept its silence Thursday, some corporate
governance specialists called for Raines's removal.
</P>
<P>
``I wouldn't invest in a company that Mr. Raines was running,''
said Gregory Taxin, chief executive of Glass, Lewis  Co., which
advises institutional shareholders. ``I think it's yet another
shocking example of a company that professed publicly to have their
house in order and yet had a substantial mess behind the scenes.''
</P>
<P>
``I feel a little bit like the curtain was pulled in the Wizard of
Oz and we see the small man behind the big image,'' said Sarah Teslik,
a longtime advocate for institutional investors who has battled Raines
over shareholder rights. ``If this isn't enough for Frank Raines to
offer his resignation ... what is?''
</P>
<P>
Nell Minow of the Corporate Library, which rates corporations on
the quality of their governance, called for the replacement of
Fannie's audit committee, which is headed by Thomas Gerrity, a
professor of management and former dean at the Wharton School. But
Minow said the publicly available information did not support the
immediate firing of Raines and Howard.
</P>
<P>
Raines' initial response to the OFHEO report might have provided
``a short-term respite'' for Fannie but now ``raises further serious
concerns about the credibility of his leadership,'' said Thomas
Linsmeier, chairman of the department of accounting and information
systems at Michigan State University.
</P>
<P>
``For them to be so far off on something like this is really in the
current environment kind of shocking,'' said Patrick McGurn, executive
vice president of Institutional Shareholder Services.

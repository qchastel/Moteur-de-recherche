FANNIE MAE CHIEF EXPECTED TO DEFEND ITS ACCOUNTING

WASHINGTON

<P>
Breaking his public silence since a federal regulator issued a
scathing report last month, Franklin D. Raines, the chairman and
chief executive of Fannie Mae, is expected to tell lawmakers on
Wednesday that his company properly applied accounting principles and
never took steps to manipulate earnings or shade financial statements
to enable top executives to receive large bonuses.
</P>
<P>
Raines and the company's chief financial officer, J. Timothy Howard,
are expected to face tough questions from the House subcommittee that
has been considering legislation to tighten the regulation of the
company.
</P>
<P>
An advance text of his statement was provided to the committee, and
in it Raines takes issue with the main conclusions of the report by
the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which said that
Fannie Mae misapplied accounting rules to manipulate earnings and
maximize executive bonuses.
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious allegation, and we strongly disagree with it,"
Raines said in his statement. "In fact, when I certify our financial
statements, I certify that these documents 'fairly present in all
material respects the financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows,' of the company," he said. "We engage in a rigorous due
diligence process before I ever put a pen to paper and make that
certification."
</P>
<P>
He said the company's application of one standard to account for
hedge fund transactions was "careful, considered and thorough," and
had been subjected to three years of review before it was put in
place in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Raines also suggested that the company would try to persuade the
Securities and Exchange Commission that the conclusions of the Office
of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight were wrong.
</P>
<P>
"The SEC will ultimately decide whether our policy was, or was not
consistent with" generally accepted accounting principles, he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who was singled out for criticism by the oversight office,
will offer a similar defense, according to a text of his prepared
testimony.
</P>
<P>
"All of my judgments regarding accounting issues were made in
openness and good faith, with the goal of providing investors with
the most meaningful and understandable information possible," Howard
says in the testimony. "When accounting issues arose I worked with
the head of my accounting policy group, who I know to be
knowledgeable and highly respected in the industry. I also made
certain that any accounting approaches we adopted were reviewed with
our outside auditor."

What Would a Kerry Cabinet Look Like? A Few Guesses
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a story of absolutely undeniable, certifiably
well-documented, highly credible and most assuredly air-tight and rock
solid RUMORS, HUNCHES and SPECULATION.
</P>
<P>
That said, there are a few things that are, in fact, facts: Whoever
wins the election in little more than two weeks will have to quickly
put together an administration -- in John Kerry's case, calling on
former Clinton officials and staffers, campaign advisers, perhaps
fellow lawmakers, past and present, to put together a White House from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
Another fact: You're more likely to hear a candidate say he botched
a question in last week's debate than admit he's talking to a buddy
about being secretary of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
But, to be sure, such personnel planning is in the works on both
sides. A Kerry aide said Tuesday that the campaign had named James A.
Johnson, a Washington lawyer who headed the Democrat's search for a
running mate, and former Clinton Labor secretary Alexis Herman to
start transition planning.
</P>
<P>
``If they're not planning and selecting people for the key jobs,
then they're not behaving responsibly,'' says Paul C. Light, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in political
appointments. ``But they've got to do it very discreetly.''
</P>
<P>
And they have. This year especially, say those who unapologetically
traffic in such rumor and innuendo, there is remarkably little
name-dropping, with the Kerry team fearful of appearing overconfident
or presumptuous and the disciplined Bush team fearful of straying from
message.
</P>
<P>
``It's amazing how few names are out there,'' says Jay Farrar, a
vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
``It's unusual at this point.''
</P>
<P>
Still, there is always some Beltway buzz. So here's a look at some
of the conventional wisdom and informed speculation about who might
land where. And in coming days, the Baltimore Sun will look at a
prospective Bush second-term Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
STATE -- Earlier in the campaign, former Clinton national security
adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger was seen as a likely secretary of
State. But Berger was forced to resign as a top Kerry adviser this
summer due to a Justice Department investigation into his removal of
classified documents from the National Archives.
</P>
<P>
Now the odds-on favorites for the post are Richard Holbrooke, a
former assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton who has been a
top Kerry foreign policy adviser, and Sen. Joseph Biden, the senior
Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
While Holbrooke helped bring peace to Bosnia, Biden could have the
edge -- he and Kerry have been close friends for 20 years and speak
regularly.
</P>
<P>
If Kerry should want someone with a more understated persona, there
are many other Democrats he could turn to: former Senate Democratic
leader George Mitchell, a peace mediator for Northern Ireland and the
Middle East; or former Sens. Sam Nunn and Gary Hart and former Rep.
Lee Hamilton, all of whom have been working in the national security
and counter-terrorism arena since leaving Congress. (Mitchell or
Holbrooke could end up as envoy to the Middle East if passed over for
the top State job.)
</P>
<P>
Not out of the question: former Clinton Treasury secretary Robert
Rubin, a Kerry adviser who is expected to land some place high up in
the administration -- if not here, possibly as Federal Reserve
chairman, succeeding Alan Greenspan who is expected to step down in
January 2006.
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE -- No glaringly obvious choice, but instead a number of
possibilities including John J. Hamre, president of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies and a former Defense official in
the Clinton administration; Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services
Committee during some of his 24 years in the Senate; or Richard
Danzig, Clinton's secretary of the Navy and one of the nation's
leading experts on biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
Other names heard: Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, senior Democrat and
former chairman of the Armed Services committee; or Ashton Carter, an
assistant secretary of Defense under Clinton now advising Kerry on
terrorism and counter-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Just as Clinton did in appointing Republican Sen. William Cohen of
Maine to head the Pentagon, Kerry could reach across the aisle for
this position. Kerry could turn to Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a
decorated Vietnam veteran and influential moderate who's been critical
of Bush's handling of the war, or John McCain, although the Arizona
senator has said he's not interested in the job under either Kerry or
Bush.
</P>
<P>
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER-- Kerry is thought to be considering a
number of former White House aides, such as Clinton's deputy national
security adviser James B. Steinberg, and Dennis Ross, who was special
Middle East coordinator for Clinton and a State Department official
for the first President Bush.
</P>
<P>
Other possibilities: Rand Beers, a national security official under
the last four presidents who left his post as a counterterrorism
adviser to Bush five days before the start of the Iraq war and joined
the Kerry team; or former Kerry primary opponent retired Gen. Wesley
Clark.
</P>
<P>
Another name heard: Joseph S. Nye Jr., former dean of the Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard and an assistant secretary of Defense
for international security in the Clinton administration who is
expected to land somewhere in a Kerry White House.
</P>
<P>
HOMELAND SECURITY -- Kerry, if elected, could also use this
position for a crossover pick, selecting former New Jersey Gov. Thomas
Kean, the Republican chairman of the 9/11 Commission. Another possible
Republican: Richard Armitage, Powell's deputy at State and someone
``highly regarded by just about everyone,'' says one Democratic
foreign policy specialist.
</P>
<P>
Democratic possibilities: Hart, Hamilton, vice chairman of the 9/11
commission, or retiring Florida Sen. Bob Graham.
</P>
<P>
INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR -- The same people named as possible Homeland
Security chief.
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE -- One name widely mentioned is Jamie Gorelick, an
assistant attorney general in the Clinton administration and more
recently a member of the 9/11 Commission.
</P>
<P>
TREASURY -- Johnson, a former Fannie Mae chairman, was the early
favorite for either treasury secretary or White House chief of staff.
The Washington power broker is considered one of Kerry's closest
confidants. But a large-scale accounting scandal at Fannie Mae could
dim Johnson's prospects unless it's resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
A Fannie Mae scandal could block another possible candidate for
Treasury, Franklin Raines, Clinton's White House budget director and
the current CEO of Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
Democrats point to Roger Altman, deputy Treasury secretary in the
Clinton administration (even though he was a bit player in the
Whitewater saga), or New York Times reporter-turned-investment banker
Steven Rattner, as two other front-runners.
</P>
<P>
There's less talk and even more of a question mark about the second
tier Cabinet posts, although some names have been bandied about: Rep.
Richard Gephardt as a possible Labor secretary and former Clinton
Environmental Protection Agency director Carol Browner as Interior
secretary.

FANNIE MAE SHAKE-UP PROMOTES 2 BOARD MEMBERS TO TOP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last two months, Franklin D. Raines has been the public face
of Fannie Mae, testifying before Congress that he believed that the
company's accounting methods were sound. Now his jobs are being taken
over by two men who are respected within the company but who are not
well known to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
Raines, who was chief executive and chairman, has been succeeded by
two members of the company's board. Daniel H. Mudd, Fannie Mae's vice
chairman and chief operating officer, will become the company's
acting chief executive. Stephen B. Ashley, a real estate executive of
the Mortgage Bankers Association, will become Fannie Mae's acting
chairman.
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae also named another executive, Robert Levin, as its interim
chief financial officer, to succeed J. Timothy Howard, who, like
Raines, was forced out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Industry specialists say that Mudd and Ashley bring different skills
to guide Fannie Mae through perhaps the most challenging period in
its history.
</P>
<P>
Mudd joined Fannie Mae in February 2000 after nearly a decade at GE
Capital, where he rose through the management ranks. He is known as a
straight shooter with in-depth knowledge of Fannie Mae's business.
What he lacks, however, are the strong political connections that
made Raines such a powerful force on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
"Political savvy has not been his expertise. He's basically been
invisible at Fannie," said Bert Ely, a financial industry consultant
who is a longtime critic of the company. "He's what I call the chief
inside guy -- the guy who makes things run every day.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Fannie's challenge right now is keeping the ship afloat and
moving ahead," Ely added, "and he's better positioned than anybody on
the board."
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, an associate dean at the Yale School of
Management, said of Mudd: "He's a very strong, solid player. He knows
his stuff." Sonnenfeld added: "He is also known for being more
direct. You don't want any ambiguity as to what is known and what is
not known."
</P>
<P>
Mudd has provided leadership amid economic turmoil before, managing
GE Capital's Asia-Pacific division through the Asian financial crisis
in the late 1990s. He also was an officer in the U.S. Marines and was
decorated for combat service in Beirut, Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ashley, who founded the Ashley Group, a large commercial and
residential real estate company with properties in New York and
Connecticut, has had significant experience both in mortgage lending
and in Washington politics. A former president of the Mortgage
Bankers Association, a trade group, he testified in front of a
Congressional Housing Subcommittee in 1991 in support of Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
Mudd and Ashley have contributed to many political candidates,
including several Republicans, according to federal election filings.
</P>
<P>
"It can hardly be overlooked that, as a Republican Congress is about
to undertake a harsh inspection of the company, Fannie Mae is
removing Raines and Howard, two men with an apparent preference for
Democratic politicians, and elevating Mudd and Ashley, two men who
support Republicans," said Jonathan Koppell, a professor at Yale
University who has studied the politics of the company.
</P>
<P>
Ely, the financial industry consultant, said: "This is just the start
of a process of cleaning things up. Fannie Mae has a lot of work
ahead."
</P>
<P>
The announcement late Tuesday night came after a series of
discussions over the last few days as board members debated Raines'
future at Fannie Mae. It came after the company's main regulator, the
Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, demanded significant
changes to the company's senior management and threatened to declare
that Fannie Mae had failed to meet its capital requirements, people
close to the process said.

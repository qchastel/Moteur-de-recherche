Fannie Mae discloses document retention request by prosecutors in
criminal probe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mortgage giant Fannie Mae, gripped by an accounting scandal and under
investigation by the Justice Department, disclosed Tuesday that
prosecutors had asked the company to preserve documents as part of
the criminal probe.
</P>
<P>
In a regulatory filing, the government-sponsored company also
reported that it has been informed of eight lawsuits on behalf of
shareholders that are being prepared or have been filed against it,
chairman and chief executive Franklin Raines and chief financial
officer Timothy Howard.
</P>
<P>
Several such suits have been announced since since Sept. 22, when
accounting questions at the company came to light amid news of a
Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into accounting at Fannie
Mae, which finances one of every five home loans in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae said in its filing with the SEC that the U.S. attorney's
office in Washington, which is pursuing the criminal investigation,
had asked it to preserve certain documents _ including papers related
to a report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight
which alleged earnings manipulation to meet Wall Street expectations
and accounting improprieties by the company.
</P>
<P>
Raines and Howard, testifying at a House hearing last week, insisted
that Fannie Mae did nothing wrong in its accounting and insisted that
the regulators' allegations represent an arguable interpretation of
complex rules. They specifically denied the allegation that, in an
instance in 1998, accounting rules were deliberately violated so that
top executives collect full bonuses.
</P>
<P>
Washington-based Fannie Mae is the second-largest financial
institution in the United States behind Citigroup Inc. It and its
smaller sibling Freddie Mac pump money into the home mortgage market
by buying and guaranteeing repayment of billions of dollars of home
loans each year from banks and other lenders, then bundling them into
securities that are resold to investors. Their stock and debt are
widely held by investors worldwide. Last year, Freddie Mac restated
some $4.5 billion (euro3.65 billion) in earnings, ousted top
executives and was fined a record $125 million (euro101.5 million) in
a settlement with the federal regulators. Its restatement of
earnings, which mostly had been understated, prompted the regulators
to examine Fannie Mae's accounting.

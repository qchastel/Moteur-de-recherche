DIRECTORS OF FANNIE MAE TO DISCUSS EXECUTIVES' FATES

<P>
The directors of Fannie Mae, the big mortgage finance company, will
meet Sunday to consider the fate of two senior executives who signed
off on financial statements that violated accounting rules, people
close to the company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two executives, Franklin D. Raines, the chairman and chief
executive, and J. Timothy Howard, the chief financial officer,
certified financial statements that the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Wednesday ordered to be restated because of significant
violations in accounting rules over their treatment of derivatives
and prepaid loans.
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae said in November that a restatement would force it to
recognize $9 billion in losses over the last three and a half years,
wiping out more than a third of its profits over that period.
Regulators could also force the company to raise its capital levels
by billions of dollars, either by selling some of the mortgages it
holds in its portfolio or through a securities offering.
</P>
<P>
As it has in recent days, the company again Friday declined to issue
a statement from the directors about how it intended to proceed. But
people close to the company said Raines was seeking a vote of
confidence from the board Sunday as he struggles to survive the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Raines, whose senior management team has come under withering
criticism by the company's main regulator, the Office of Federal
Housing Enterprise Oversight, testified to Congress two months ago
that he expected to be held accountable by Fannie Mae's directors and
shareholders if his interpretation of the accounting rules was set
aside by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Long a formidable political power in Washington, Fannie Mae's support
has eroded in recent months both because of the conclusions of
regulators and because of the growing effectiveness of rival
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Raines, who led the Office of Management and Budget at the White
House under President Bill Clinton, has lately appeared to have lost
much of the support he had from Republicans. And in recent days, some
prominent Democrats have accused the company of being mismanaged and
have demanded that Raines return the tens of millions of dollars he
has received in bonuses.
</P>
<P>
If directors decide to remove Raines, the selection of a successor
would be politically tricky. Candidates would need significant
credibility in a city that is dominated at both ends of Pennsylvania
Avenue by Republicans, particularly as the company faces the
virtually inevitable prospect of new legislation and tighter
regulation. But they would also have to be committed to the company's
affordable-housing goals, which are often identified with Democratic
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The decision on Raines' successor would ultimately fall to the board
of the company, although administration officials could play an
important role in recommending or vetoing choices, particularly since
the company is in a more vulnerable position.
</P>
<P>
Among the names circulating in governmental circles on Friday to
succeed Raines was Robert B. Zoellick, the U.S. trade representative.
He has worked at Fannie Mae twice before, including one stint in the
1990s when he was a senior executive in charge of its
affordable-housing business as well as its legal affairs and
governmental relations offices.
</P>
<P>
Zoellick has also been said to be on the short list of contenders to
be the next head of the World Bank.

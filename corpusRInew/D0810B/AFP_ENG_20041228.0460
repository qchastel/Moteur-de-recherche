<P>
US mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae, found guilty of violating
accounting rules and accused of paying dizzying bonuses to its
bosses, has made public the entitlements and compensation claimed by
its departing chief executive and finance director.
</P>
<P>
In a document delivered to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), Fannie Mae also acknowledged having received a letter from the
Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), informing the
company of its investigation into pay and bonuses of former chief
executive Franklin Raines and of former finance director Timothy
Howard, both of whom were sacked on December 21.
</P>
<P>
Raines can claim 600,000 dollars in salary for the period from
December 22 to June 22, 2005, the date at which his retirement
becomes effective, the Fannie Mae document shows.
</P>
<P>
Raines' monthly pension payments should then amount to 116,300
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the ex-chief executive also has more than 1.6
million stock options and can claim 8.7 million dollars in deferred
payments from Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
Howard could be eligible for 84,000 dollars in salary between
December 20 and the end of January 2005, before claiming 36,000
dollars a month once retired.
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae, embroiled in an accounting scandal, now faces rising
suspicions about pay and benefits for its former directors.
</P>
<P>
In the dossier delivered to the SEC, Fannie Mae agreed to provide the
OFHEO with information requested.
</P>
<P>
Following the departure of Raines and Howard, vice-president Daniel
Mudd was named interim chief executive while executive vice-president
Robert Levin was promoted to finance director, the company said.

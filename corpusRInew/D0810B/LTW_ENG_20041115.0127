Fannie Mae Misses SEC Filing Deadline

<P>
Fannie Mae, accused by regulators of deliberately
flouting accounting rules, said Monday that it could not meet a
deadline for a quarterly financial report and may be required to
record $9 billion of previously unreported losses if the Securities
and Exchange Commission determines that its accounting was wrong.
</P>
<P>
Such a correction would erase nearly 38 percent of the mortgage
funding company's reported income since Jan. 1, 2001, when the key
rule took effect.
</P>
<P>
The company faced a deadline late Monday to file a report with the
SEC for the quarter ended Sept. 30 but said it was unable to do so
because its auditor could not complete the required review of its
financial statements. In a news release, Fannie said its income for
the third quarter fell $251 million, or 9 percent, to $2.4 billion
from the third quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae's accounting has been under investigation by the Justice
Department and the SEC, and it has become the subject of investor
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Regulators at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight
reported in September that they found pervasive accounting violations
at Fannie. The company was driven by a desire to make its earnings
growth appear consistent, OFHEO Director Armando Falcon Jr. testified
before Congress last month. In 1998, the company also improperly
delayed booking $200 million of expenses, enabling top executives to
receive their maximum bonuses instead of no bonuses, the agency
alleged.
</P>
<P>
OFHEO accused Fannie of violating two accounting rules. One, known
as FAS 133, governs the treatment of complex financial instruments
known as derivatives used to hedge against changes in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Fannie said Monday that if its hedge accounting is invalidated, it
could be required to retroactively report $13.5 billion of losses and
$4.5 billion of gains, netting a $9 billion decrease in earnings since
the beginning of 2001.
</P>
<P>
There would be a corresponding $9 billion decrease in Fannie's
regulatory capital, the cushion it is required to maintain against a
potential financial downturn. As of June 30, the minimum was $31.2
billion and Fannie had $36.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
The company estimated the net cumulative loss if its accounting is
wrong on the other rule, known as FAS 91, would be $26 million.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the problems regulators cited on that rule, Fannie
said Monday that it found a mistake in some of its accounting related
to FAS 91. The net effect of correcting that mistake will be to
increase earnings for 2001 and 2002 and decrease them for 2003. The
impact on 2003 will be insignificant and the overall effect of
correcting the problem Fannie discovered will be a wash, Fannie said.
</P>
<P>
Fannie continues to assert that its accounting methods ``are
consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.''
</P>
<P>
The company has long argued that FAS 133 produces a distorted
picture of its earnings because the rule forces it to include
unrealized gains and losses on its income statement.
</P>
<P>
Fannie said its outside auditor, KPMG LLP, concurred with the
interpretations it presented in recent letters to the SEC defending
its accounting.
</P>
<P>
But Fannie also hinted that it may take time for KMPG to sign off
on its financial statements again. The auditor's review ``is subject
to resolution of'' the questions pending before the SEC and a separate
review of OFHEO's findings being conducted by an outside law firm for
Fannie's board of directors. The SEC resolution could be months away,
SEC spokesman John Nester said.
</P>
<P>
If Fannie is required to correct past financial statements, chief
executive Franklin D. Raines and chief financial officer J. Timothy
Howard could be required to give up past bonuses and stock gains
linked to the improper accounting.
</P>
<P>
Chartered by the government to provide a steady flow of funds for
home mortgages, Fannie Mae is one of the nation's largest and most
complex financial institutions, with a stock market value of about $68
billion and debts of $956.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
Missing the filing deadline does not necessarily trigger any
regulatory response. The SEC evaluates such situations on a
case-by-case basis, spokesman Nester said.
</P>
<P>
Fannie's smaller mortgage funding rival, Freddie Mac, announced in
January 2003 that it expected it would need to correct accounting from
prior years. The company, which has hired an army of consultants to
help upgrade its accounting systems and has spent more than $370
million on accounting and legal expenses, has not resumed issuing
quarterly financial statements on a timely basis and says it does not
plan to do so until next year.
</P>
<P>
Fannie released its statement after the market closed. Its stock
closed at $70.20, down 21 cents.

Fannie Mae announces elimination of bonuses for top executives

<P>
Mortgage giant Fannie Mae announced Friday it was withholding millions of
dollars in bonuses from its top executives as it continued to come to grips with
revelations of serious financial reporting problems.
</P>
<P>
The nation's biggest backer of home mortgages announced in a filing to the
Securities and Exchange Commission that its board of directors had voted to
eliminate cash bonuses that would have been paid for the performance of top
executives in 2004. The company said it was also postponing the payment of any
stock awards for last year.
</P>
<P>
This action will affect 43 top officials who will lose millions of dollars in
scheduled performance bonuses.
</P>
<P>
The company also said in the filing that Fannie Mae controller Leanne Spencer,
the company's top accounting officer, had "stepped down" earlier this week to
take a lesser role as special adviser to Michael Williams, the president of the
company's Internet business.
</P>
<P>
Fannie Mae's chief executive, Franklin Raines, and its top financial officer,
Timothy Howard, were forced out last month after revelations that the company
will have to restate some $9 billion (euro6.9 billion) in earnings, or about
one-third of its profits, dating to 2001.
</P>
<P>
To begin making up that shortfall and increase the company's capital reserves,
Fannie Mae announced on Tuesday that it was cutting its first-quarter dividend
payment by half, to 26 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
The company is also expected to sell off part of its portfolio of mortgages and
raise fresh capital by issuing stock.
</P>
<P>
Regulators in the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ordered the
company in September to boost its capital cushion, the amount of reserves it has
to guard against financial losses, by some $5 billion (euro3.8 billion) by the
middle of 2005.
</P>
<P>
In its new SEC filing on Friday, Fannie Mae did not disclose the total amount in
cash bonuses that were being eliminated, and company spokesmen also refused to
give a figure other than to indicate it would be in the millions of dollars and
would affect the company's 43 top executives.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, just the top five officers at Fannie Mae received $8.2 million (euro6.3
million) in cash bonuses.
</P>
<P>
The action by the board will mean that Raines and Howard will be denied cash
bonuses they would have received for 2004. The board had come under heavy
criticism in recent weeks for allowing both men to leave the company with
lucrative severance packages.
</P>
<P>
In another action disclosed on Friday, the Fannie Mae board voted to eliminate
the requirement that the company's chief executive officer, the position
formerly held by Raines, also serve as chairman of the company's
board.

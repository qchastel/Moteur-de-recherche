SCENES FROM A COURTROOM, WHERE FAITH AND SCIENCE CLASH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HARRISBURG, Pa.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Casey Brown testified last week week, she
embodied the pain and division the intelligent design controversy has
wrought in Dover, just south of here.
</P>
<P>
Brown sat stiffly on the witness stand, her mouth as tight
as her gray ponytail, recounting how she had run for
school board on the same ticket as the board members
now facing her from the defense table.
</P>
<P>
The board is being sued by 11 parents who say that
intelligent design is creationism cloaked as science, is inherently religious
and has no place in a ninth-grade biology class.
</P>
<P>
Brown said her political alliances and friendships had become strained in
the last couple of years as some board members had
pressed for changing the biology curriculum to teach creationism on
par with evolution. They wanted to buy an intelligent design
textbook, "Of Pandas and People," in place of the newest
edition of the standard biology text.
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by Patrick Gillen, a soft-spoken defense lawyer, Brown was
asked whether she recalled visiting the home of a board
member and admiring a carving of the Last Supper.
</P>
<P>
"The Lord's Last Supper, yes sir," Brown said. "I had never
seen such a beautiful carving."
</P>
<P>
But she said she did not feel comfortable when the board
member asked her if she was a born-again Christian. She
also said she felt disturbed when another board member, who
was among those most insistent about teaching creationism, drove her
home from a meeting and asked the same question.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, his manner changing, Gillen pounced: These were Brown's friends, she
was in their homes, in their cars, and she found
it offensive to be asked about religion?
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I do, and I still do, sir," she said.
</P>
<P>
A bite in his voice, Gillen asked if she thought religion
should not be discussed at all.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't presume to discuss religion within normal circumstances," she said,
"except within my own family."
</P>
<P>
Brown and her husband quit the board the night members voted
6-3 for intelligent design.
</P>
<P>
WORLDS IN CONFLICT
</P>
<P>
The trial presents a particular challenge for the journalists from science
magazines. In the courtroom hallway during a break last week,
Celeste Biever, a reporter for NewScientist, was interviewing a courtroom
regular, a bearded local pastor who says he considers evolution
a lie.
</P>
<P>
"You want half-bird, half-fish?" Biever asked, drawing a dotted line on
her notepad.
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, why not," the pastor said.
</P>
<P>
Later, out of the pastor's hearing, Biever said with fascination, "He
thinks evolution is a bird turning into a fish turning
into a rabbit" -- one straight line of common descent,
instead of a tree with common roots.
</P>
<P>
Biever was finding that she could not cover the trial the
way she would a classic courtroom face-off. When you put
intelligent design up against evolution, she said, "It's not a
head-on collision between two scientific arguments; it's orthogonal," with the
opponents coming at each other from right angles.
</P>
<P>
"It's apples and oranges," Biever said.
</P>
<P>
Her readers do not take intelligent design seriously, she said, so
she was striving for "local color." Her readers want to
know, she said, "Why is this happening here?"
</P>
<P>
"We're not just science cheerleaders, and I don't want to overlook
any valid argument for intelligent design," Biever said. "As far
as I'm concerned, I haven't heard one yet."
</P>
<P>
As for the pastor, after four days of listening to science
experts dismantling the case for intelligent design, he was unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
"They're babblers," said the pastor, the Rev. Jim Grove, who leads
a 40-member independent Baptist church outside of Dover. "The more
Ph.D.'s you get, it seems like the further away from
God you get."
</P>
<P>
Dover school board members were well aware they were inviting a
lawsuit over church-state issues when they voted last October that
biology students should hear a statement telling them that there
were gaps in the theory of evolution and that intelligent
design was another theory the students should examine.
</P>
<P>
But board members forged ahead, having been assured that they would
have the backing of the Thomas More Law Center, a
nonprofit law firm dedicated to providing legal representation to Christians,
and its chief counsel, Richard Thompson.
</P>
<P>
ONE SIDE OF THE CULTURE WAR
</P>
<P>
In courtroom breaks Thompson occasionally sits next to board members and
puts an arm around their shoulders. White-haired and dapper, he
has said little in court, leaving most of the cross-examination
to his two co-counselors.
</P>
<P>
But last week, he became the public face of the intelligent
design movement, stepping into the ring of cameras and microphones
outside the courthouse each afternoon, taking every question until, one
after another, the reporters slipped away.
</P>
<P>
As a former Michigan prosecutor who tried repeatedly to convict Dr.
Jack Kevorkian, Thompson is comfortable in the spotlight. He failed
in his prosecution of Kevorkian and eventually lost a bid
for re-election; voters told pollsters they did not share his
outrage over assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
Thompson's major argument in defending the board is that intelligent design
is not religion, but science. He is, however, absolutely open
about his own religious motivations.
</P>
<P>
During the lunch break on Thursday, Thompson said he founded the
law center to defend Christians who he thought were losing
the culture wars. The center was initially financed by Thomas
Monaghan, the founder of Domino's Pizza. Both men are Roman
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
"There are two worldviews that are in conflict," Thompson said. "I
do feel that even though Christians are 86 percent of
the population, they have become second-class citizens."

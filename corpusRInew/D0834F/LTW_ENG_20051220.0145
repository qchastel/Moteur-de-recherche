Federal Judge Rejects Religious Alterations to Science Education
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Compelling biology teachers to present ``intelligent design'' as an
alternative explanation to evolution violates the constitution, a
federal judge ruled Tuesday, saying the concept is ``an interesting
theological argument, but ... not science.''
</P>
<P>
The ruling came after federal District Judge John E. Jones III
heard 21 days of testimony during a closely watched six-week trial
that pitted a group of parents against the school board of the small
town of Dover, Pa.
</P>
<P>
In October 2004, the board had required school officials to read a
statement to ninth graders which declared that Charles Darwin's
concept of evolution is ``a theory . . . not a fact'' and that ``gaps
in the theory exist for which there is no evidence.''
</P>
<P>
``Intelligent Design is an explanation of the origin of life that
differs from Darwin's view,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Backers of intelligent design argue that biological systems are so
complex they could not have arisen by a series of random changes. The
complexity of life implies an intelligent designer, they assert. Most
of the movement's public spokesmen take care not to publicly say
whether the designer they have in mind is equivalent to the God of the
Bible. On that basis, they argue that their theory is a scientific
one, not religious.
</P>
<P>
Jones, a church-going conservative jurist who was appointed to the
federal bench by President Bush in 2002, used much of his 139-page
ruling to dissect those claims, rejecting them at every turn.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts described the ruling as a sharp defeat for the
intelligent design movement -- one likely to have considerable
influence with other judges although it has binding legal force only
in one section of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
The school district will not appeal the ruling, said Patricia Dapp,
who was elected to the Dover board earlier this year. The supporters
of intelligent design were voted out of office in that election, she
said.
</P>
<P>
At the trial, held in Harrisburg, the state capital, Jones heard
testimony from leading advocates of intelligent design as well as
experts on evolutionary theory.
</P>
<P>
The ``overwhelming evidence'' established that intelligent design
``is a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a
scientific theory,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
The public statements of school board members, he said, made clear
that they adopted the statement in order to advance specific religious
views.
</P>
<P>
Testimony at the trial included statements that at one board
meeting, one of the backers of the intelligent design statement had
``said words to the effect of `2,000 years ago someone died on a
cross. Can't someone take a stand for him?' '' the judge noted.
</P>
<P>
``Although proponents of the (Intelligent Design Movement)
occasionally suggest that the designer could be a space alien or a
time-traveling cell biologist, no serious alternative to God as the
designer has been proposed by members'' of the movement, including
expert witnesses who testified, Jones wrote.
</P>
<P>
Statements by the board members that they had only secular purposes
in mind -- to improve science teaching and foster open debate -- were
a ``sham,'' and a ``pretext for the board's real purpose, which was to
promote religion in the public school classroom,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating attacks, Jones took care to say that his ruling was
not the ``product of an activist judge.''
</P>
<P>
The judge excoriated the school board officials for lying in their
testimony and for not bothering to understand what intelligent design
was about before making their decision, Jones said. He rebuked what he
called the ``breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision.''
</P>
<P>
``This case came to us as the result of the activism of an
ill-informed faction on a school board, aided by a national public
interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case'' on
intelligent design, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
The Dover trial was one of several battlegrounds for intelligent
design in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Last January, a U.S. District court judge in Georgia ruled that the
school system in Cobb County, outside of Atlanta, had violated the
Constitution by requiring stickers on biology textbooks which cast
doubts on the theory of evolution.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the federal appeals court in Atlanta considered
arguments in that case, with at least one judge expressing strong
doubts about the lower court ruling.
</P>
<P>
In Kansas, the state Board of Education has changed the definition
of science to permit supernatural explanations.
</P>
<P>
That reliance on the supernatural was key to Jones' rejection of
the Dover school board's position.
</P>
<P>
Intelligent design arguments ``may be true, a proposition on which
this court takes no position,'' he wrote, but it ``is not science.''
</P>
<P>
``The centuries-old ground rules of science'' make clear that a
scientific theory must rely solely on natural explanations that can be
tested, he wrote.
</P>

</P>
<P>
That portion of the decision won praise from Kenneth R. Miller, a
biology professor at Brown University in Providence, R.I. He was the
lead expert witness for the parents in the case and is the author of
biology textbooks used in both college and high school classrooms
around the country.
</P>
<P>
Miller testified that it was critical that scientific propositions
be testable.
</P>
<P>
To illustrate his point, Miller, an avid fan of the Boston Red Sox,
testified that when his team beat the New York Yankees in the 2004
baseball playoffs, a fan might have believed ``God was tired of
(Yankee owner) George Steinbrenner and wanted to see the Red Sox
win.''
</P>
<P>
``In my part of the country, you'd be surprised how many people
think that's a perfectly reasonable explanation for what happened last
year. And you know what? It might be true. But it certainly is not
science ... and it's certainly not something we can test,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Supporters of intelligent design quickly denounced Jones' ruling
along the lines the judge had predicted.
</P>
<P>
``The Dover decision is an attempt by an activist federal judge to
stop the spread of a scientific idea ... and it won't work,'' said
John West, associate director for the Center for Science and Culture
at the Discovery Institute. The institute, based in Seattle, is a
major backer of the intelligent design movement.
</P>
<P>
``Anyone who thinks a court ruling is going to kill off interest in
intelligent design is living in another world,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
Richard Thompson, of the Thomas More Law Center, the lead lawyer
for the board members called the ruling an ``ad hominen attack on
scientists who happen to believe in God.''
</P>
<P>
``The founders of this country would be astonished at the thought
that this simple curriculum change (was) in violation of the
constitution that they drafted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
But Lee Strang, a constitutional law professor at Ave Maria Law
School in Ann Arbor, Mich., which advocates a greater role for
religion in public life, said that given Supreme Court precedents and
the evidence that the Dover school board members had religious goals
in mind, Jones ruling was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court in 1987 had barred the teaching of a theory
that backers called ``creation science'' in public schools.
``Intelligent design'' emerged as a theory after that ruling, Jones
noted in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Laycock of the University of Texas Law School said the
ruling was likely to have considerable influence because it came after
a trial in which ``both sides brought in their top guns'' to testify.
</P>
<P>
The judge's detailed ruling ``will be quite persuasive to other
judges and lawyers thinking about provoking a similar case
elsewhere,'' he said.

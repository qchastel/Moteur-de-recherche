EXPERT WITNESS SEES EVIDENCE IN NATURE FOR INTELLIGENT DESIGN

HARRISBURG, Pa.

<P>
Michael J. Behe, a biochemistry professor at Lehigh
University, has spent the last eight years traveling to colleges
across the country promoting "intelligent design" as a challenge to
the theory of evolution.
</P>
<P>
On Monday he brought his lecture and slides to a closely
watched trial in federal district court, where a judge will
decide whether the town of Dover violated the boundary between
church and state when it introduced a statement about intelligent
design in a high school biology class.
</P>
<P>
The Dover school board is being sued by 11 parents who
say intelligent design is inappropriate in a biology class because
it is merely religious creationism repackaged to resemble science. Proponents
of intelligent design, however, argue that living organisms are so
complex that the best explanation is that a higher intelligence
designed them.
</P>
<P>
With the trial starting its fourth week, Behe was the first
expert witness called by the defense. Asked whether intelligent design
is religion, or "based on any religious beliefs or convictions,"
Behe said, "No, it isn't."
</P>
<P>
"It is based entirely on observable, physical evidence from nature," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Behe said the "best and most striking example of design" is
the bacterial flagellum, "the outboard motor bacteria use to swim."
He projected a drawing of a flagellum depicting what he
called a "rotary motor" attached to a "drive shaft" that
pushes a propeller, and said it is impossible to avoid
concluding that the mechanism is "a purposeful arrangement of parts."
</P>
<P>
Behe is the author of "Darwin's Black Box," a book published
in 1996 that spurred the intelligent design movement. He is
also a fellow at the Discovery Institute, a think tank
that advocates intelligent design.
</P>
<P>
For the last three weeks, the plaintiffs have presented a parade
of expert witnesses, including a biologist, a theologian, a paleontologist
and two philosophers -- all of whom testified that intelligent
design does not meet the definition of science because it
cannot be tested or disproved. They said that intelligent design
proponents have not published scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals and
that most scientists do not question evolution's basic tenets.
</P>
<P>
Behe testified that intelligent design is science, that it makes "testable
scientific claims" and that teaching it "promotes good science education."
</P>
<P>
Behe testified that intelligent design does not claim to identify the
intelligent designer, or even to "require knowledge of the designer."
</P>
<P>
However, Behe, a Roman Catholic, was asked whether he had concluded
that "the designer is God." He said yes, but added
that his conclusion was not based on science.
</P>
<P>
"I concluded that based on theological, philosophical and historical facts," he
said.

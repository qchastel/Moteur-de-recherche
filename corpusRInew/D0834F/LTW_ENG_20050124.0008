God and Darwin

The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post:

With their slick Web sites, pseudo-academic conferences and savvy
public relations, the proponents of ``intelligent design'' -- a
``theory'' that challenges the validity of Darwinian evolution -- are
far more sophisticated than the creationists of yore. Rather than
attempt to prove that the world was created in six days, they operate
simply by casting doubt on evolution, largely using the time-honored
argument that intelligent life could not have come about by a random
natural process and must have been the work of a single creator. They
do no experiments and do not publish in recognized scientific
journals. Nevertheless, this new generation of anti-evolutionists,
arguing that children have a ``right to question'' scientific truths,
has had widespread success in undermining evolutionary theory.

Perhaps partly as a result, a startling 55 percent of Americans --
and 67 percent of those who voted for President Bush -- do not,
according to a recent CBS poll, believe in evolution at all. According
to a recent Gallup poll, about a third of Americans believe that the
Bible is literally true. Some of these believers have persuaded
politicians, school boards and parents across the country to question
their children's textbooks. In states as diverse as Wisconsin, South
Carolina, Kansas, Montana, Arkansas and Mississippi, school boards are
arguing over whether to include ``intelligent design'' in their
curriculums. Last week, in Pennsylvania's Dover School District, an
administrator read a statement to ninth-grade biology students saying
that evolution is not fact. Over the objections of ninth-grade science
teachers and of parents who have filed suit, he offered ``intelligent
design'' as an alternative. Also last week, a Georgia county school
board voted to appeal a judge's decision to remove stickers describing
evolution as a ``theory, not a fact'' from school textbooks. In both
cases, the anti-evolutionists have been very careful in their choice
of language, eschewing mentions of God or the Bible. Nevertheless,
their intent was clear. As the lawsuit filed by Dover parents states,
``intelligent design is neither scientific nor a theory in the
scientific sense; it is an inherently religious argument or assertion
that falls outside the realm of science.'' Discussion of religion in a
history or philosophy class is legitimate and appropriate. To teach
intelligent design as science in public schools is a clear violation
of the principle of separation of church and state.
</P>

It also violates principles of common sense. In fact, the breadth
and extent of the anti-evolutionary movement that has spread almost
unnoticed across the country should force American politicians to
think twice about how their public expressions of religious belief are
beginning to affect education and science. The deeply religious nature
of the United States should not be allowed to stand in the way of the
thirst for knowledge or the pursuit of science. Once it does, it won't
be long before the American scientific community -- which already has
trouble finding enough young Americans to fill its graduate schools --
ceases to lead the world.

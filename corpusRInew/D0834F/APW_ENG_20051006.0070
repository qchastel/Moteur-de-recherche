Witness: Book replaced 'creation' with 'intelligent design' before publication

References to creationism in drafts of a student biology book were replaced with
the term "intelligent design" by the time it was published, a witness testified
in a landmark trial over a school board's decision to include the concept in its
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
Drafts of the textbook, "Of Pandas and People," written in 1987 were revised
after the Supreme Court ruled in June of that year that states could not require
schools to balance evolution with creationism in the classroom, said Barbara
Forrest, a philosophy professor at Southeastern Louisiana University, in
testimony Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Forrest reviewed drafts of the textbook as a witness for eight families who are
trying to have the intelligent design concept removed from the Dover Area School
District's biology curriculum.
</P>
<P>
The families contend that teaching intelligent design effectively promotes the
Bible's view of creation, violating the separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
Intelligent design holds that life on Earth is so complex that it must have been
the product of some higher force. Opponents of the concept say intelligent
design is simply creationism stripped of overt religious references.
</P>
<P>
Forrest outlined a chart of how many times the term "creation" was mentioned in
the early drafts versus how many times the term "design" was mentioned in the
published edition.
</P>
<P>
"They are virtually synonymous," she said.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy approved by Dover's school board in October 2004, students must
hear a brief statement about intelligent design before classes on evolution. The
statement says Charles Darwin's theory is "not a fact" and has inexplicable
"gaps."
</P>
<P>
Forrest also said that intelligent-design proponents have freely acknowledged
that their cause is a religious one. She cited a document from the Discovery
Institute, a Seattle-based think tank that represents intelligent-design
scholars, that says one of its goals is "to replace materialistic explanations
with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by
God."
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by school board lawyer Richard Thompson, Forrest
acknowledged that she had no evidence that board members who voted for the
curriculum change had either seen or heard of the Discovery Institute
document.
</P>
<P>
The trial began Sept. 26 and is expected to last as long as five
weeks.

<HEADLINE>
CENTER TO SUM UP ITS CASE FOR INTELLIGENT DESIGN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HARRISBURG, Pa.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, a lawyer for the Thomas More
Law Center visited school boards around the country searching for
one willing to challenge evolution by teaching intelligent design, and
to face a risky, high-profile trial.
</P>
<P>
Intelligent design was a departure for a nonprofit law firm founded
by two conservative Roman Catholics -- one the magnate of
Domino's pizza, the other a former prosecutor -- who until
then had focused on the defense of anti-abortion advocates, gay
rights opponents and the display of Christian symbols like crosses
and nativity scenes on government property.
</P>
<P>
But Richard Thompson, the former prosecutor who is president and chief
counsel of the Thomas More Center, says its role is
to use the courts "to change the culture" -- and
it well could depending on the outcome of the test
case it finally found.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the center are to sum up their case on
Friday after a six-week trial in which they have been
defending the school district in the small Pennsylvania town of
Dover. The school board voted last year to require that
students in ninth grade biology class be read a statement
saying that "Darwin's theory" is "not a fact" and that
intelligent design is an alternative worth studying.
</P>
<P>
At issue in the Dover lawsuit, brought by 11 parents in
U.S. District Court, is whether intelligent design is really religion
dressed up as science, and whether teaching it in a
public school violates the constitutional separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
The More center's lawyers put scientists on the witness stand who
contended that intelligent design -- the idea that living organisms
are so complex that the best explanation is that a
higher intelligence designed them -- is a credible scientific theory
and not religion because it never identifies God as the
designer.
</P>
<P>
The scientific community generally dismisses intelligent design as pseudoscience, because it
cannot be tested by experiment.
</P>
<P>
Religion is at the heart of the case's appeal for the
center, say its lawyers and the chairman of its board.
</P>
<P>
The chairman, Bowie Kuhn, the former baseball commissioner, said the board
agreed that the center should take on an intelligent design
case because while it is not necessarily based on religion
"it is being opposed because people think it is religious."
And that was enough for a group whose mission, as
explained on its Web site, is "to protect Christians and
their religious beliefs in the public square."
</P>
<P>
"America's culture has been influenced by Christianity from the very beginning,"
Thompson said, "but there is an attempt to slowly remove
every symbol of Christianity and religious faith in our country.
This is a very dangerous movement because what will ultimately
happen is, out of sight, out of mind."
</P>
<P>
The legal group was founded in 1999 by Thompson and Thomas
Monaghan, the former chief executive of Domino's pizza. At the
time, Thompson had just lost his re-election campaign for prosecutor
in Oakland County, Mich., defeated by voters disenchanted by his
pursuit of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the retired pathologist who attended
numerous assisted suicides.
</P>
<P>
They named the center after the 16th century British politician and
author of "Utopia," a critic of Protestantism who was beheaded
for his Catholic beliefs and eventually made a saint by
his church. Members of the center's board include Sen. Rick
Santorum, R-Pa.; Alan Keyes, a former Republican presidential candidate and
talk show host; and Kuhn, the former baseball commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Monaghan contributed the startup money. But in recent years the center
has been forced to raise its own funds as Monaghan
focused his money on building Ave Maria University, a Catholic
college in Florida.
</P>
<P>
In earlier cases, the center defended an enormous cross placed on
a hill outside San Diego and nativity scenes in Florida
and New York. It sued the Ann Arbor, Mich., schools
for providing benefits for same-sex partners. And in one of
its most controversial cases, it defended an anti-abortion group that
ran an online list of doctors it said should be
stopped from providing abortions. The doctors said the group was
threatening them and their families. Thompson said in an interview
it was "a very important free speech case."

To find its first intelligent design case, the lawyers went around
the country looking for a school board willing to withstand
a lawsuit. In May 2000, Robert Muise, one of the
lawyers, traveled to Charleston, W. Va., to persuade the school
board there to purchase the intelligent design textbook "Of Pandas
and People" and teach it in science class.
</P>
<P>
Muise told the board in Charleston that it would undoubtedly be
sued if the district taught intelligent design, but that the
center would mount a defense at no cost.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be your shields against such attacks," he told them at
a school board meeting, a riff on the center's slogan:
"The Sword and Shield for People of Faith." He said
they could defend teaching intelligent design as a matter of
academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
John Luoni, the former president of the Charleston school board, said
he remembered listening to Muise and concluding: "It's not really
a scientific theory. It's more of a religious theory. It
should be taught if a church or a denomination believes
in it, but I didn't think that religious viewpoint should
be taught as part of a science class."
</P>
<P>
The board in West Virginia declined the center's offer. So did
school districts in Michigan and Minnesota and a handful of
other states, Muise and Thompson said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
In Dover, Pa., the firm found willing partners when it contacted
the school board in the summer of 2004 and promised
it a first-class defense,
</P>
<P>
The Dover school board proceeded despite a memo from its lawyer,
Stephen S. Russell, warning that if the board lost the
case, they would have to pay its opponents legal fees
-- which according to the plaintiffs' lawyers exceeds $1 million.
In the memo, revealed in court on Wednesday, Russell advised
that opponents would have a strong case because board members
had a lengthy public record of advocating "putting religion back
in the schools."
</P>
<P>
Some of the proponents of intelligent design are also unhappy that
the case went to court, and fear it could stop
the movement in its infancy because some board members had
a public record of advocating creationism, which the Supreme Court
has twice ruled cannot be taught in public schools.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
"The school district never consulted us and did the exact opposite
of what we suggested," said John G. West, a senior
fellow at the Discovery Institute, a think tank in the
forefront of the intelligent design movement. "Frankly I don't even
know if school board members know what intelligent design is.
They and their supporters are trying to hijack intelligent design
for their own purposes. They think they're sending signals in
the culture wars."
</P>
<P>
Thompson, the Thomas More Center's chief counsel, said the case appealed
to him because of its "national impact." Four months before
the trial started, he said, he watched the movie "Inherit
the Wind," a drama about the Scopes evolution trial eighty
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"It's only when you take the cases that are on the
borderline that you can change the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
No matter how the Dover case turns out, the center is
considering defending several teachers who are defying their school districts
by teaching intelligent design.
</P>
<P>
"We're developing all this expertise in intelligent design," Thompson said. "We
hope to use it."

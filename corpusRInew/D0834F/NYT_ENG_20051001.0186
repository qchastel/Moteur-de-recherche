THE DISAGREEMENT IS NOT THEORETICAL

<P>
DOVER, Pa. - After Super Mario swam the clear blue sea
and someone beat someone else at foosball and a girl
named Kate quoted the Gospel of John to explain why
God is an unavoidable fact of life, they said grace.
</P>
<P>
"Dear Heavenly Father," 19-year-old Brandon Spangler said. "We just thank you
for this day, for being with us on this wonderful
Wednesday."
</P>
<P>
Near the back of the dinner line in the basement of
Dover-Bethany United Methodist Church, Ashley Ruppert stopped giggling. She closed
her eyes. She had spent the morning in biology lab,
building fat molecules out of beads and straws, and the
afternoon playing video games beneath a bumper sticker that said
"I don't have enough FAITH to believe in evolution." She
likes biology, but she doesn't believe in Darwin's theory of
evolution.
</P>
<P>
"There's too many holes," she says. "Where are the in-between stages?
We only have the beginning and the end. Why can't
you see a human that's just extremely hairy? Or a
monkey that's walking upright?"
</P>
<P>
God and science are at war in Dover, a small community
of cornfields, mud-spattered pickup trucks and country churches in southern
Pennsylvania, where last fall, the School Board decided students should
hear a four-paragraph statement on intelligent design at the beginning
of their ninth-grade lesson on evolution.
</P>
<P>
"Because Darwin's theory is a theory, it continues to be tested
as new evidence is discovered," the statement says. "The theory
is not a fact. Gaps in the theory exist for
which there is no evidence. . . . Intelligent design
is an explanation of the origin of life that differs
from Darwin's view."
</P>
<P>
The school district was sued by 11 parents, including Tammy Kitzmiller,
a woman with blond feathered hair whose daughter Jessica chose
to stand out in the hallway rather than listen when
the statement was read in her biology class.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that they have brought a religious idea into the
classroom, and I object to that," Kitzmiller told a judge
this week. "I do not think this is good science."
</P>
<P>
In a federal courtroom in Harrisburg, a landmark case is unfolding.
</P>
<P>
It is about the meaning of the separation of church and
state in a country where a recent Harris poll found
that nearly two-thirds of adults believe human beings were created
directly by God.
</P>
<P>
It is about whether intelligent design is a new science or
just a new way of talking about creationism. And everyone
knows it is about more than just one small Pennsylvania
town. The lawyers are already talking about taking this case
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
In Dover Township, a rough triangle of farmland dotted with red
barns, pizza places and used car lots, they are talking,
too. About why people in hot climates have darker skin
than people in cold climates. About the structure of the
human eye and the minds of teenagers, because in some
fundamental way, this case is about what a 13-year-old thinks
when she looks through a microscope.
</P>
<P>
In Dover, there is no hard line between scientific questions and
spiritual ones.
</P>
<P>
This is a place where kids do their chemistry homework with
Christian rock playing in the background. If we're made up
of atoms and there's a lot of space between the
nucleus and the electrons, Ashley Ruppert wants to know why
we're not full of holes. If we came from mud,
how did the mud get here? And if God made
everything, where did He come from?
</P>
<P>
Up in Harrisburg, lawyers for the School Board say they are
fighting for open-mindedness, for the right to ask any question.
They say Darwin's theory of evolution has become dogma, and
that intelligent design is "science in its purest form," like
Newton's experiments with gravity.
</P>
<P>
"It shares the attitude of those who worked in the field
of quantum mechanics, who posited the wave-particle duality, despite the
fact that to some it smacked of the supernatural," Patrick
Gillen, a lawyer for the School Board, told the judge.
</P>
<P>
In the courtroom, the two sides are ranged like opposing armies.
Here you have the parents in suits and flowered skirts
and their lawyers from the ACLU. Over there, the School
Board members and their lawyers from the Thomas More Law
Center, a Michigan firm whose stated purpose is "to be
a sword and shield for people of faith." Reporters sit
in the jury box, because there is no jury in
this trial, only a judge.
</P>
<P>
The first to testify is Dr. Kenneth R. Miller, a professor
at Brown University who co-wrote Biology, the textbook the kids
in Dover use. He says he started writing textbooks because
he wanted teenagers to know that there are still things
out there to discover, things in nature that are explained
by natural processes. Not ideas like intelligent design.
</P>
<P>
"Intelligent design is not science," Miller said.
</P>
<P>
It is the theory that some things in nature are best
explained by an intelligent cause, not natural selection.
</P>
<P>
But human beings are fallible, Miller says, and if you invoke
a spiritual cause, a scientist cannot test it. You can't
order it from a biological supply place or grow it
in a petri dish or test it in a laboratory.
An idea like this might even stop kids from wanting
to do scientific research. What's the point, Miller asks, if
the only way we can explain the miracle of life
is by pointing to a creator?
</P>
<P>
Miller believes in God, but he says there are questions science
can answer and questions you might ask a priest, and
they aren't the same thing.
</P>
<P>
"If I could solve the question of the meaning of my
life by doing an experiment in my laboratory, I assure
you I would run off and do it right now,"
he tells the judge.
</P>
<P>
He starts to explain evolution. Some genes have errors, and by
comparing those errors, you can test genetic links. On a
screen along the wall, a picture of apes appears. The
courtroom is quiet, but you can hear the echo. In
1925, during the Scopes trial, they had chimpanzees doing tricks
out on Main Street in Dayton, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
The slide shows a chimpanzee, a gorilla and a human being.
They all share the exact same set of genetic mistakes,
Miller says. They're all primates. All came from Africa. Horses,
cats and dogs don't have the same genetic mistakes we
do. Matching mistakes spell common ancestry.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five miles away in Dover, Ashley Ruppert flips through Miller's Biology.
She is sitting at KT's restaurant across the street from
the high school, eating french fries. They haven't gotten to
the section on evolution yet, but Ashley has already Googled
Darwin and talked about intelligent design with her mom.
</P>
<P>
"Why is it easier to believe that we evolved from monkeys
than that we were created by a higher power?" Beth
Ruppert asks when she comes to take Ashley home. "I
don't get it."
</P>
<P>
She's not the only one. In Dover, 100 people turn out
for a junior varsity field hockey game on a Tuesday
night and the cheerleaders stop practicing and stand at attention
when the national anthem plays. It's a place where kids
race high-wheeled pickup trucks through muddy fields on weekends -
a pastime known as muddin' - and listen to the
Doors and Aerosmith.
</P>
<P>
"It's like it never got out of the past," says Brandon
Miller, 17.
</P>
<P>
But there are dissenters here. In the high school parking lot
one evening, Jeremy Naylor, the senior class president, gets talking
about the lessons of ninth-grade biology.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't really evolve from monkeys," he says. "It's a long
process and what it says is it basically started out
with, like, a puddle."
</P>
<P>
Jeremy isn't religious. He doesn't think intelligent design has any place
in school. Ernie Seigle, an 18-year-old senior, agrees, even though
he goes to church every Sunday before his 12-hour factory
shift. He believes in the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
""I don't need to be in church every day of the
week," Ernie says.
</P>
<P>
Dissent is never easy. In the courtroom, Bryan Rehm, a high
school physics teacher and one of the parents suing the
school district, says living in Dover has gotten harder.
</P>
<P>
"You used to be able to go out to any restaurant,
sit down, not worry about who was next to you,"
he tells the judge. "You could walk down the street
and say "Hi' to everybody and get a nice pleasant
return. Now people stare."
</P>
<P>
They sometimes call him an atheist now. And worse.
</P>
<P>
"They don't know me," he says. "They don't know that I'm
the co-director of the children's choir at church or that
I run the music halfway at the second service, or
that, you know, my wife and I run Vacation Bible
School. Yet they have no problem going around calling me
an atheist because my particular religious viewpoint doesn't agree with
that of the School Board."
</P>
<P>
At a School Board meeting last fall, Rehm says, one board
member said something like: "Two-thousand years ago, somebody died on
a cross, can't somebody stand up and take a stand
for him?" The defense lawyers deny it.
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things that I couldn't believe," Rehm said.
</P>
<P>
In Dover, it doesn't sound so strange. At the Salem United
Church of Christ, the marquee says, "This church under same
management for over two thousand years!" A sign across the
street reads: "We walk by the spirit, not by sight."
</P>
<P>
Up the road at the Lighthouse Baptist Church, where pamphlets assure
you that hell is for real, Pastor Sterling Walsh Jr.
says the evidence of the natural world points directly to
a creator. Anyone can see it, even a child.
</P>
<P>
"If you grow up in a rural area like this, you
just go out and see God," Walsh says. "It's obvious
to everybody until we talk each other out of it.
It's obvious there must be something out there that's intelligent."
</P>
<P>
On a table at the front of the church, there's a
plastic bag full of buttons that say "I support Dover
school board." The board isn't asking them to teach intelligent
design, Walsh says, just to mention it. What people are
really scared of, he says, is God.
</P>
<P>
He opens his Bible to Romans, Chapter 1. The page is
dog-eared, highlighted, marked with ink.
</P>
<P>
"That which can be known of God is manifest in them,"
he reads, "for the invisible things of God can be
clearly seen in creation."
</P>
<P>
At a table in KT's, Ashley Ruppert is talking about the
invisible things of nature, how our bodies are made up
of cells and tiny bugs live on our skin. In
biology class, she was asked to look through a microscope
and draw what she saw. She drew an amoeba and
something called an Oscillatoria, a long green bacteria with stripes
like a snake.
</P>
<P>
She has read Genesis. The earth without form, God moving over
the water.
</P>
<P>
"It's real bleak," she says. "I prefer things that are solid."
</P>
<P>
And that makes her think that maybe there really is a
difference, after all, between the questions you ask in biology
and the ones you ask in church.
</P>
<P>
She knows that in science, there are rules governing gravity and
atomic mass and the way hydrogen bonds with oxygen. The
rules don't change. You can ask a question and get
an answer. She knows spiritual questions don't work that way.
</P>
<P>
"I have a friend who would read the Bible every day,"
Ashley says. "She found the answer when she read. Or
what she thought was her answer."
</P>
<P>
Nothing like gravity. When you drop a ball, it falls. It
always falls.

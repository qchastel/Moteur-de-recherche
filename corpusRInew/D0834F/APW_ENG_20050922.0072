Intelligent design debate takes center stage in Pennsylvania federal court

<P>
The latest chapter in a long-running debate over teaching evolution in public
schools is about to unfold in federal court. In a civil trial set to begin here
Monday, the Dover Area School District will defend its policy requiring
ninth-grade students to hear about "intelligent design" in a preamble to biology
lessons on evolution.
</P>
<P>
Intelligent design, a concept advanced over the past 15 years, holds that
Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection causing gradual changes over time
cannot fully explain the origin of life or the emergence of highly complex life
forms. It implies that life on earth was the product of an unidentified
intelligent force.
</P>
<P>
Critics say intelligent design is merely creationism _ a literal reading of the
Bible's story of creation _ camouflaged in scientific language, and it does not
belong in a science curriculum. Eight Dover families are suing the school
district, alleging that the policy violates the constitutional separation of
church and state.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to demonstrate that the prior (legal) precedent, which forbids
the teaching of creationism, applies here as well," said Eric Rothschild, a
Philadelphia attorney representing the families.
</P>
<P>
The state American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of
Church and State are assisting the parents, including lead plaintiff Tammy
Kitzmiller.
</P>
<P>
"The school board has no business instructing children about religious matters,"
Kitzmiller said at a December news conference on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
The history of evolution litigation dates back to the famous 1925 Scopes Monkey
Trial, in which Tennessee biology teacher John T. Scopes was fined $100 for
violating a state law that forbade teaching evolution. The Tennessee Supreme
Court reversed his conviction on the narrow ground that only a jury trial could
impose a fine exceeding $50, and the law was repealed in 1967.
</P>
<P>
In 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned an Arkansas state law banning the
teaching of evolution. And in 1987, it ruled that states may not require public
schools to balance evolution lessons by teaching creationism.
</P>
<P>
The issue has become a priority for many religious groups, which accuse
scientists of stepping outside their field into the realm of theology with some
of their pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
Dover is believed to have been the first school system in the nation to require
students to hear about the concept under the policy adopted in October 2004. But
the clash over intelligent-design is evident far beyond this rural district of
about 3,500 students 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Harrisburg.
</P>
<P>
In August, the Kansas Board of Education gave preliminary approval to science
standards that allow intelligent design-style alternatives to be discussed
alongside evolution.
</P>
<P>
President George W. Bush has also weighed in, saying schools should present both
concepts.
</P>
<P>
Richard Thompson, president and chief counsel of the Thomas More Law Center,
which is defending the school district, says Dover's policy takes a modest
approach.
</P>
<P>
It requires teachers to read a statement that says intelligent design differs
from Darwin's view and refers students to an intelligent-design textbook, "Of
Pandas and People," for more information.
</P>
<P>
"All the Dover school board did was allow students to get a glimpse of a
controversy that is really boiling over in the scientific community," Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
The Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based think tank that represents scholars who
support intelligent design, opposes mandating it in public schools.
Nevertheless, it considers the Dover lawsuit an attempt to squelch voluntary
debates over evolution.
</P>
<P>
"It's Scopes in reverse. They're going to get a gag order to be placed on
teachers across the country," said institute senior fellow John
West.
</P>
<P>
To build their cases, each side is enlisting a battery of academic experts.
Witnesses for the defense include biochemist Michael Behe of Lehigh University,
who defended intelligent design in his 1996 book, "Darwin's Black Box: The
Biochemical Challenge to Evolution."
</P>
<P>
Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education,
which supports teaching evolution in public schools, said the controversy has
little to do with science because mainstream scientists have rejected
intelligent-design theory.
</P>
<P>
Intelligent design supporters "seem to have shifted virtually entirely to
political and rhetorical efforts to sway the general public," Scott said. "The
bitter truth is that there is no argument going on in the scientific community
about whether evolution took place."

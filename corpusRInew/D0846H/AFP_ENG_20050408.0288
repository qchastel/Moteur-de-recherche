KRAKOW, Poland, April 8
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pope John Paul II's native 
Poland came to a standstill Friday as tolling bells and wailing 
sirens signalled the start of his funeral in distant Rome.
</P>
<P>
In Krakow, some 800,000 pilgrims who had gathered on Blonia 
esplanade, a vast field on the city's periphery where the pope 
celebrated mass for some three million people on his last visit to 
Poland in 2002, fixed their gazes on specially erected giant screens 
showing live images from Rome.
</P>
<P>
They, and the huge crowds gathered in towns, cities and villages 
elsewhere around the country, watched emotionally as John Paul II's 
simple wooden coffin, adorned with a cross and the M for Mary, was 
brought from Saint Peter's Basilica into the huge square outside and 
placed in front of an altar. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be together with other people," said a young mother 
on the esplanade with her two children, aged one and six.
</P>
<P>
"When I was four, I saw the pope for the first time in Warsaw in 
1979. I was with him then and I am sure my children want to be here 
now," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to once again sing our thanks for the pontificate 
of John Paul II," Bishop Jozef Guzek was quoted by Poland's PAP news 
agency as saying before the start of the funeral ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Time will dry our tears. We now transform our silence into 
prayer," he said.
</P>
<P>
John Paul II had special, close ties with Krakow, having studied 
in the former royal capital, been ordained as a priest there and 
celebrated his first mass at the city's Wawel Cathedral in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
He was bishop and cardinal of Krakow from 1963 until he was 
elected pope in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
In the capital Warsaw, trams and buses, and the few pedestrians 
in the streets, stopped in their tracks as tolling bells and moaning 
sirens signalled the start of the ceremony at 10:00 am (0800 GMT).
</P>
<P>
With Friday declared a national holiday for the funeral, shops, 
local and international schools, banks, even the busy Warsaw stock 
exchange were shut.
</P>
<P>
Many Poles chose to watch the ceremony from home, where it was 
beamed live from Rome by Polish television.
</P>
<P>
Those who did venture outside sought the company of fellow 
mourners in places such as Blonia esplanade in Krakow, in front of 
the basilica of Our Lady in the southern town of Wadowice, where 
John Paul II was born Karol Wojtyla in 1920, or at Warsaw's 
Pilsudski and Zamkowy squares where giant screens had been set up.
</P>
<P>
More than the 20,000 people who usually live in Wadowice were 
gathered outside the town's basilica.
</P>
<P>
Most watched the ceremony without tears, their faces frozen in 
concentration as they took in the words and images of their 
favourite son before he was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
Near them, an empty chair was draped with yellow and white 
colours of the Vatican, appended with the black ribbon of mourning.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the chair, John Paul II had bantered with inhabitants 
on his last visit to his birthplace in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, some 30,000 gathered in Pilsudski Square, another 
high holy place in John Paul II's pontificate. It was there that, on 
June 10, 1979, the pope uttered the memorable phrase: "May the 
spirit come down and renew the face of this land."
</P>
<P>
Those words were interpreted by many as an exhortation to stand 
up to the oppressive communist regime and allow a new Poland to be 
born.
</P>
<P>
John Paul II, who died on Saturday April 2, is widely credited 
with helping Poland to throw off the cloak of communism.

<P>
The next pope should not try to be another 
John Paul II, the Polish-born pope's first private secretary, Irish 
Bishop John Magee, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Magee told journalists that the next pope should try to "be 
himself."
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be very wrong if a new pope would try to 
emulate what John Paul II had," he said.
</P>
<P>
Magee was private secretary to John Paul II from his election in 
1978 until 1982 when he was succeeded by Polish Archbishop Stanislaw 
Dziwisz, who was at the pontiff's bedside when he died last 
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Irish bishop, who was also private secretary to John Paul I 
during his ill-fated 33-day reign as pontiff, also said John Paul II 
had bequeathed him something which he was not prepared to reveal.
</P>
<P>
"He left something very special for me, as a sign of his 
gratitude, but I'm not prepared to say what it is," he said, adding 
that Dziwisz had given it to him on his arrival in Rome on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to his final testament released Thursday by the 
Vatican, the pope left no personal property, instructing Dziwisz to 
burn all his personal notes.

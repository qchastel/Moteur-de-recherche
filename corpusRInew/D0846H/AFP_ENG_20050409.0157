VATICAN CITY, April 9
</DATELINE>

<P>
Only a new pope can beatify John 
Paul II, a Vatican spokesman said Saturday, saying any decision 
creating a saint was "in the sole competency" of the pope's 
successor.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, was speaking a day after 
the funeral of John Paul II, when a section of the massive crowd 
called for his immediate sainthood.
</P>
<P>
Cardinals are to meet in secret at a conclave beginning April 18 
to elect a successor to the pontiff, who died a week ago after 26 
years as leader of the Roman Catholic Church worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Friday's funeral mass for John Paul II was briefly interrupted 
when many in the crowd began chanting "santo, santo" repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
Others held up large banners demanding "santo subito" (sainthood 
now) for a man who created more saints than all his predecessors put 
together.
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church has three steps to sainthood.
</P>
<P>
First is a ruling that the person concerned has led an exemplary 
life. The next stage is beatification, which requires proof of a 
miracle as a result of his intercession.
</P>
<P>
The final stage, canonisation, requires at least one more 
miracle.

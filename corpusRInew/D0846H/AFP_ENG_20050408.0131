<P>
The funeral ceremony for Pope John 
Paul II began Friday in Saint Peter's Square in front of a seething 
mass of mourners and state leaders.
</P>
<P>
Applause broke out as the plain cypress wood coffin was borne 
out of Saint Peter's Basilica by 12 bearers in black and placed on a 
small dais before the altar.
</P>
<P>
Dignitaries from around the world stood in respect as the coffin 
was placed at the heart of the altar.
</P>
<P>
A red-bound New Testament was opened and placed on top of the 
coffin, its pages flickering in the wind, as funereal music played 
and Catholic prelates took their seats.

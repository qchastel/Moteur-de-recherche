<P>
Several hundred people of all faiths 
prayed Friday evening at Warsaw synagogue for Polish-born Pope John 
Paul II, who was laid to rest in Rome.
</P>
<P>
The ecumenical prayer service was led by the Grand Rabbi of 
Poland, Michael Schudrich, Poland's PAP news agency said.
</P>
<P>
"In his lifetime, John Paul II worked to unite people. We are 
all the children of God and a few hours ago, down there (in Rome) it 
worked -- we were really united," Schudrich told the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Schudrich had taken part in John Paul II's funeral in Rome 
earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
Warsaw's Jewish community numbers some 400 people. Before World 
War II the Polish capital had the second largest urban Jewish 
community in the world after New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Schudrich has estimated the number of Jews living in Poland at 
between 30,000 and 40,000 -- only a fraction of the pre-war number 
of around 3.5 million.

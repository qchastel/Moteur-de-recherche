<P>
Fatal coal mine accidents in China rose 
8.5 percent in the first eight months of this year, with thousands 
dying despite stepped-up efforts to make the industry safer, state 
media said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released as the government and state media 
reported another deadly blast, this time at an illegal coal mine in 
northern China on Monday in which 17 people died.
</P>
<P>
Citing government statistics, Xinhua news agency said coal mine 
fatalities had increased 8.5 percent in the first eight months of 
2005 compared with the same period last year, without giving the 
total number.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 miners died in accidents in China last year, 
according to previously released government figures. Independent 
estimates say the real figure could be as high as 20,000.
</P>
<P>
China's coal mining industry, driven by the huge demand to fuel 
the nation's power plants and drive its rapid industrialization, is 
regarded as the most dangerous in the world.
</P>
<P>
China relies on coal for two-thirds of its energy needs and 
production has spiralled in recent years as the economy has expanded 
at breakneck speed.
</P>
<P>
The government intends to increase coal production to 2.4 
billion tons by 2010, up from 2.1 billion currently, Xinhua said on 
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Official efforts to make mines safer have largely failed because 
mine owners simply reopen closed pits illegally, critics say.
</P>
<P>
Officials often turn a blind eye to the illegal operations as 
many people in authority, even those in charge of inspecting mines, 
own stakes in the lucrative businesses.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua revealed on Wednesday that a government investigation had 
found 4,578 officials nationwide had stakes in coal mines, with the 
amount of capital invested totalling 653 million yuan (80.5 million 
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government earlier this year began forcing officials to 
withdraw investments in mines to reduce the number of accidents.
</P>
<P>
Some officials acted as coal mine owners themselves, while 
others accepted bribes from mine owners when issuing permits, and 
helped mines hide death tolls when accidents occurred.
</P>
<P>
Monday's blast occurred at the Fenhemao Coal Mine in 
Changlianggou town, Yuanping city of Shanxi province, and reportedly 
followed a familiar pattern with the mine operating illegally.
</P>
<P>
The blast at the mine killed all 13 miners working underground 
at the time, the State Administration for Work Safety said on its 
website.
</P>
<P>
Mine management immediately sent a team of six rescuers down the 
pit, but two rescuers suffocated.
</P>
<P>
The blast also damaged a neighboring mine and killed two people 
there, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
The small village-run mine had been ordered to shut down from 
October 1 to December 31 because it failed to meet safety standards 
and had expired production permits, Shanxi news website quoted local 
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the mine remained opened, closing only briefly during 
inspections, the website quoted workers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities had visited the mine on the morning of the 
blast to make sure it had stopped production but it resumed 
operations after the inspectors left, workers said.
</P>
<P>
The owner of the mine, Han Buhong, has fled, the website said.

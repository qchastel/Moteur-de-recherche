The National Bureau of Production 
Safety Supervision and Administration has set a timetable for 
solving problems related to the country's hundreds and thousands 
of small coal mines, the Economic Information Daily reported 
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xianzheng, deputy director of the administration, told a 
national meeting on coal science and technology, his 
administration aims to solve the small coal mine related problems 
within three years.
</P>
<P>
The registered legitimate small coal mines, which currently 
stand at 23,000 in China, will fall to 19,000, with the closing 
down of 4,000 of them at the end of this year, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
These coal mines have a combined coal output capacity of 120 
million tons, he added.
</P>
<P>
The number of small coal mines will drop further after 
undergoing regrouping and mergers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang also revealed that at present more than 10,000 small coal 
mines have been ordered to suspend production for improvement 
because of lack of safe production licence applications.
</P>
<P>
Coal is  China's major energy resource, accounting for 67 
percent in the country's consumption structure of all primary 
energy resources.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of 
regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety.
</P>
<P>
But the situation is still grave. Coal mine accidents occur one
after another throughout the country. Official statistics said 
that in the January-September period of this year, 4,228 people 
were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents. Up to Oct. 10, there 
were 43 major accidents nationwide. A major accident means more 
than 10 deaths  at one time.

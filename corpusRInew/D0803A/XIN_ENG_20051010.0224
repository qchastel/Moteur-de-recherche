<P>
China will close down a number of 
ill-operated coal mines at the end of this month, said a work 
safety official here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The country's work safety authority will release the list of 
the first batch of coal mines to be closed down, said Wang 
Xianzheng, deputy director of the National Bureau of Production 
Safety Supervision and Administration.
</P>
<P>
Before this bid, the bureau had ordered 8,648 coal mines which 
failed to renew their work safety certificates to stop operation 
for safety checks due to the frequent blasts and accidents took 
place in coal mines throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Describing the closing of the mines as the most difficult part 
in the prevention process of coal mine accidents, Wang expected to
confront resistance as the closing will certainly hurt the 
interests of the coal mine owners, as well as those who have 
benefits in that.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, most provincial level authorities have 
submitted their specific steps for coal mine safety check to the 
bureau, "But many of them only give vague plans only with 
deadlines set as late December."
</P>
<P>
The bureau had already required them to report more detailed 
plans, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
"All the coal mines that fail to pass the check will be closed 
down this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the closing acts should be carried out exactly 
according to laws and may employ law enforcement, he said.

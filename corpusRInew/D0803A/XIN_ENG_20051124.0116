<P>
Coal mine accidents killed 173 
persons in northwestern Shaanxi Province by October this year, the
provincial safety watchdog of coal mine production said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The accident number and death toll saw a year-on-year increase 
of 18 and 42 percent respectively, highlighting the "severe 
situation" of the safety management in Shaanxi's coal mining 
industry, according to the provincial committee of industrial 
safety.
</P>
<P>
Coal producers in towns are most vulnerable to accidents due to
poor safety-guarantee facilities and the mine owners' indifference
on safety operation rules, said an official with the provincial 
department of coal mine production, citing that more than 67 
percent of the accidents and nearly 80 percent of the death toll 
were reported in these mines.
</P>
<P>
The production safety in the state-owned collieries, however, 
has been given due attention and both the accidents number and 
death toll decreased 72 percent, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has decided to strengthen the 
management and supervision on the coal producers and the private 
coal mines will be the major targets in a coming safety 
examination in December.

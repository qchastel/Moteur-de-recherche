China has dismissed two provincial deputy governors and prosecuted 96 officials
blamed for six high-profile coal mine accidents that killed a total of 528
people over the past 13 months, the government announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
All six disasters were blamed on managers who failed to follow safety rules,
sometimes with official collusion, the country's top industrial and mine safety
officials said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The communist government has tried without success in recent years to reduce the
carnage in China's coal mines, which are by far the world's deadliest, with more
than 5,000 deaths annually in fires, explosions and other disasters.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that all coal mines will learn from the bitter lessons these accidents
have taught and will strengthen their safety precautions," said Li Yizhong,
director of China's industrial safety agency.
</P>
<P>
Li complained that management standards at China's biggest state-owned mines
were deteriorating despite repeated official promises to improve safety. He
complained that operators of some small, private mines "don't respect
life."
</P>
<P>
The deputy governors of Shaanxi province in the northwest and Guangdong in
southern China were dismissed after being found partially responsible for mine
accidents, according to Chen Changzhi, deputy minister of the Ministry of
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 96 officials were prosecuted and 126 other officials were demoted
or fired, Li and the other officials announced.
</P>
<P>
Li said he didn't know what penalties the officials might face if convicted of
criminal charges, but he said some possible offenses carry prison terms of up to
seven years. He said the most severe punishment that his department can impose
is removing an official from his post.

<P>
In China's deadliest recent coal mine accident, at least 169 miners were killed
when coal dust caught fire at the Dongfeng Coal Mine in Qitaihe, a northeastern
city.
</P>
<P>
In February, an explosion in the Sunjiawan Coal Mine, also in China's northeast,
killed 214 miners. It was the country's deadliest reported mine accident since
the 1949 communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
Aside from coal mines, China's fatality rate from other industrial accidents was
falling, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Tiechui, deputy director of China's mine safety agency, appealed to the
public and mine employees to report safety violations and accidents that mine
managers try to cover up.
</P>
<P>
Regulators received 16 tips this year about attempts to cover up accidents that
killed a total of 41 people, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The government has created a fund to pay whistleblowers up to 10,000 yuan
(US$1,200; euro1,000) for tips, Zhao said. Such a reward is a huge sum in a
country where the average worker makes about US$1,000 a year, and many families
get by on far less.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that with increased scrutiny by the public and the media, such coverup
incidents will become less and less," Zhao said.

<P>
A coal mine blast in northern China left at least 74 workers dead, the
government said Thursday, marking the third massive coal mine disaster to hit
China's perilous industry in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident comes despite repeated government safety crackdowns and
pledges by the leadership to improve conditions. China's mine are the world's
deadliest, with accidents reported on a near-daily basis.
</P>
<P>
The explosion Wednesday at the privately run Liuguantun Colliery in Tangshan, a
city in Hebei province, occurred when 188 miners were underground, the official
Xinhua News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua said an earlier article that reported 186 miners were underground was
incorrect.
</P>
<P>
An initial investigation showed that a mixture of airborne coal dust and gas
known as fire damp ignited, causing the blast, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-two managed to escape on their own and 32 miners were immediately rescued
but three of those later died, Xinhua said. The bodies of 71 miners had been
recovered from the mine by early Thursday, bringing the death toll to 74, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua reported that an additional 32 miners remained missing but did not
explain why these miners were not included in the figure for the total
underground when the blast occurred.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers searching for miners in an unrelated blast in northern China last week
struggled unsuccessfully for days to get an accurate count of how many miners
were working when that blast occurred, underscoring the mismanagement and
inattention to safety protocols that plague the industry.
</P>
<P>
Li Yizhong, director of the State Administration of Work Safety, and Zhao
Tiechui, director of the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety, departed
Beijing for the site late Wednesday, the official Xinhua News Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
China churns out about 2 billion tons of coal a year, making it the world's
largest coal producer followed by the United States which produces about 1
billion tons a year.
</P>
<P>
But China's mines are far deadlier. More than 6,027 people were killed in
Chinese mines last year compared to the 28 reported killed in U.S. mines by the
national Mine Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
The worst Chinese mine disaster in recent years occurred in February in
northeastern Liaoning province, when an explosion killed 214
miners.
</P>
<P>
Corruption, lax safety rules and poor equipment are among factors often blamed
for the accidents. The government has shut down thousands of unsafe mines and
punished mine owners who put profits ahead of lives. But China's enormous need
for energy, stemming from its booming economy, has complicated the
issue.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, rescuers recovered the body of the last miner missing in a Nov. 27
blast at the Dongfeng Coal Mine in China's northeastern Heilongjiang province,
bringing the number of fatalities in that blast to 171.
</P>
<P>
The accident prompted Premier Wen Jiabao to declare over the weekend that the
industry was "chaotic and without safety enforcement in place," according to Li
Yizhong, the director of China's State Administration of Work
Safety.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers at the Sigou Coal Mine in central Henan province were on Wednesday
still trying to save 42 miners trapped underground after the shaft flooded last
Friday, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
Divers have been dispatched for the search, and rescuers have also fed a
microphone into the mine to listen for signs of life, Xinhua said. So far, there
has been no indication that the workers survived. A total of 76 miners were
working underground at the time, and 34 escaped.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have detained 10 of the mine's officials, including the owner, who
had fled but was captured after a "massive manhunt," Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the crackdown, punishments are often meted out to local mine or
government officials, many who try to escape the scene.

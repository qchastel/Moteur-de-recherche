DeLay Aides Helped Steer Mariana Contracts to Lobbyist
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two former top aides of House
Majority Leader Tom DeLay brokered a political deal here five years
ago that helped land island government contracts worth $1.6 million
for a Washington lobbyist now the target of a federal corruption
probe.
</P>
<P>
Using promises of U.S. tax dollars as bartering chips, Edwin
Buckham and Michael Scanlon traveled to these remote Pacific islands
in late 1999 to convince two local legislators to switch their votes
for speaker of the 18-member House of Representatives in the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. They succeeded.
</P>
<P>
Once in office, the new speaker pressed the island's governor to
re-instate an expired lobbying pact with Jack Abramoff, now under
grand jury and congressional investigation.
</P>
<P>
Within months of the visit, Abramoff's law firm had a contract
paying $100,000 a month from the Marianas government. Also, the island
districts of the legislators who switched sides soon won federal
budget benefits from Congress, apparently supported by DeLay.
</P>
<P>
Details of the overseas mission and the trade of political favors
nearly half the globe from Capitol Hill, come from interviews,
government documents and e-mails reviewed by the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
The latest disclosures coming out of the Pacific islands add fuel
to the yearlong political scandal swirling around Abramoff and his
ties to congressional leaders, especially DeLay. The Republican
majority leader lately has sought to distance himself from the
besieged lobbyist he once called a close friend.
</P>
<P>
DeLay has been stung by charges that Abramoff paid some of the
congressman's expenses on foreign travel, including a golf junket to
Scotland, in potential violation of House ethics rules. DeLay said he
thought expenses were properly paid by a think tank.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff's prominent lobbying career crashed last year after the
Senate Committee on Indian Affairs accused him and Scanlon of ripping
off six Indian tribes who had paid them $66 million. Both men took the
Fifth Amendment at the hearings. A federal grand jury is now
investigating.
</P>
<P>
``This is starting to smell more like criminal activity -- trading
congressional appropriations for votes,'' said U.S. Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif. A longtime critic of Abramoff and DeLay's activities
in the Pacific island territories, Miller renewed his recent call for
an investigation of Abramoff by the House Resources Committee that
oversees the region.
</P>
<P>
DeLay declined to respond to a series of detailed questions for
this report but his spokesman issued a statement defending the
congressman's actions that he said were aimed at improving the
standard of living for U.S. citizens living in the territory.
</P>
<P>
In December 1999, when they traveled to Saipan, Scanlon was in his
last days as communications director for DeLay and also was listed as
a staff aide to DeLay on the House Appropriations Committee. A
spokesman for DeLay said Scanlon was on unpaid leave at the time of
the trip, but records show he did not leave the payroll until January
2000.
</P>
<P>
Buckham, a former chief of staff for the Texas Republican, had
opened his own lobbying company, Alexander Strategy Group. At the
time, his company collected fees from DeLay's main political fund and
then paid a salary to DeLay's wife, Christine, for her work for the
fund.
</P>
<P>
Buckham declined to respond to detailed questions. Scanlon's lawyer
did not respond to similar questions. A spokesman for Abramoff also
declined to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
The Mariana Islands, a self-governing U.S. territory subject to
acts of Congress, have proven to be a veritable treasure chest for
Abramoff. His lobbying successes have been closely linked to his
relationship with DeLay.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, Abramoff and two law firms where he was a partner
collected more than $7.7 million from the commonwealth government,
records show.
</P>
<P>
He lobbied to keep Washington from cracking down on the island's
garment industry where workers are paid $3.05 an hour, well below the
federal minimum wage of $5.15, to work in what critics say are
substandard sweatshop conditions. The workers, many brought in from
China under less-restrictive immigration rules than in the rest of the
United States and most of its territories, produce garments that are
still stamped ``Made in USA,'' thanks, in part, to the efforts of
Abramoff and DeLay.
</P>
<P>
DeLay helped lead the fight beginning in 1997 to keep Congress from
enacting reforms opposed by Abramoff and his clients that would have
required garment manufacturers to pay their workers the higher federal
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
``Make no mistake about it, passage of that bill would kill jobs,
growth and opportunity,'' DeLay said in a statement he put in the
Congressional Record in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a June 1997 letter to the Marianas governor , DeLay, then the
majority whip, and Majority Leader Dick Armey promised to block any
legislation to increase federal regulation on garment manufacturers,
according to published accounts.
</P>
<P>
Three years later a bill that would have barred the use of ``Made
in USA'' by the island's apparel industry was never even brought up
for a House vote though it had 234 co-sponsors, more than a majority.
</P>
<P>
DeLay traveled to Saipan, the Marianas capital,, with his family in
1998 on a trip arranged by Abramoff, who billed the island government
for the time his firm spent setting up the trip, records show.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff told island officials that DeLay is ``our biggest
supporter on Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued this week a Delay spokesman said the
legislation that the majority leader opposed ``would have strangled
the (Marianas') burgeoning economy.'' He also cited the island
government's commitment ``to implement free-market reforms that would
dramatically increase employment opportunities and living standards.''
</P>
<P>
Despite his success, however, Abramoff's lobbying arrangement with
the Northern Marianas government ended in late 1998, according to
official lobbying reports, because of a change in administrations and
commonwealth fiscal problems. His government work had been suspended
for more than a year when DeLay's former aides came to the islands
before Christmas 1999.
</P>
<P>
One of Abramoff's strong local allies and supporters was Benigno
Fitial, an underdog contender for speaker of the House. The
speakership vote was set for early 2000.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Fitial called Buckham a longtime friend and said
the former DeLay chief of staff offered to help and bring along
Scanlon.
</P>
<P>
``They supported me and wanted me to be speaker,'' Fitial said.
</P>
<P>
Fitial said he met with the Washington visitors after they arrived,
and targeted two key members of the Legislature for persuasion efforts
-- Alejo Mendiola and Norman Palacios.
</P>
<P>
Both said in separate interviews that Buckham and Scanlon promised
to help get money for needed projects in their impoverished island
districts. For Palacios, it was assistance repairing a dilapidated,
half century-old breakwater on the island of Tinian. Palacios agreed
to switch and backed Fitial.
</P>
<P>
``They said they would lobby for money for the breakwater,'' he
said of his meeting with Scanlon and Buckham. Asked why he, a longtime
Democrat would switch support to Fitial, the head of the rival
Covenant Party, Palacios said, ``That's politics.''
</P>
<P>
In October 2000, Congress passed a federal appropriations bill for
energy and water that included $150,000 for the first steps in the
breakwater restoration project. DeLay, then a member of the House
Appropriations Committee, was on the conference committee approving
the allocation.
</P>
<P>
Mendiola, who no longer serves in the CNMI House, said he was
promised federal assistance but denied any specific project was
mentioned. Island records show efforts were under way to provide
federal funding for an airport repaving project on Rota, the island
Mendiola represented.
</P>
<P>
In May 2000, the Rota runway resurfacing project was among the
airport projects that the House Appropriations Committee directed
should be given priority for discretionary grants in the Federal
Aviation Administration budget for 2001, according to the committee
report on the bill. DeLay also was a member of the transportation
subcommittee that prepared the report.
</P>
<P>
Palacios and Mendiola said they were well aware of Scanlon's and
Buckham's ties to DeLay.
</P>
<P>
``They worked for him,'' Mendiola said.
</P>
<P>
Fitial denied the federal budget benefits were tied to his
speakership vote.
</P>
<P>
``No! No! No! There was no -- I give you something, you give me
something,'' Fitial said.
</P>
<P>
Following the visit of Buckham and Scanlon, Fitial took several
steps to pressure the island government to renew and extend contracts
with Abramoff's law firm.
</P>
<P>
He sent e-mails to top government officials warning of dire
consequences if Abramoff was not awarded a new contract. In an e-mail
to a top aide of then-Gov. Pedro P. Tenorio on June 30, 2000, Fitial
wrote:
</P>
<P>
``Please urge Teno to execute the agreement as we will continue to
encounter problems . . . if the contract is not executed. We need P 
G (Abramoff's law firm) to help save our economy. . . . Please
help!!''
</P>
<P>
The Fitial-led House also passed two resolutions urging the
governor to hire a lobbyist, including a July 26, 2000, resolution
calling for selection of Abramoff's firm. A few days later, Tenorio
relented and hired the firm for $100,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
In 2001, Fitial went to bat again for Abramoff, pressing to assure
that the lobbyist's contracts were extended. He supported a resolution
saying that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks ``have created an urgent
need for the continued services'' of Abramoff's firm. Palacios was a
sponsor of that resolution.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff's billing records, recently made public by the Marianas
government, show how the lobbyist used the islands to woo Washington
friends and then used those Washington friends to woo his island
clients.
</P>
<P>
For example, the lobbyist and his law firm routinely arranged for
congressional junkets to the islands, despite ethics rules barring
such practices. Travel costs often were advanced by the firm or
charged to Abramoff's personal credit card, including expenses for as
much as $67,466, records showed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern for ethics rules in one e-mail urging Mariana
officials to speed reimbursement of thousands of dollars to his firm.
Abramoff warned that the House ethics committee was asking questions.
</P>
<P>
The billing records also provide a rare glimpse behind the scenes
of Abramoff's self-promotion to impress his lobbying clients.
</P>
<P>
In one 2001 memo, Abramoff bragged to Marianas officials about an
unnamed top U.S. Department of Justice official who was the lobbyist's
guest at his box seat for a Washington Redskin game.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff said the official tipped him off about a secret internal
document that might jeopardize CNMI's cherished immigration
exemptions. He said there was concern in some quarters that island
immigration rules, favoring the garment industry, could be exploited
by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
``They (Department of Justice officials) have been spending a week
or so telling everyone who will listen that the CNMI, if it is not
taken over, will be a major entry point for terrorists. This, of
course, is patently ridiculous,'' Abramoff wrote on Oct. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The lobbyist turned that threat into an opportunity to demonstrate
his potential value, saying he could help thwart such efforts and
would be seeing the attorney general in a week.
</P>
<P>
``It will require some major action from the Hill and a press
attack to get this back in the bottle,'' Abramoff wrote.
</P>
<P>
The Abramoff memo prompted denials from current and former Justice
Department officials.
</P>
<P>
David Ayres, who was chief of staff to then Attorney General John
Ashcroft, acknowledged attending the Redskins game ``at the invitation
of two longtime friends and former colleagues'' but denied there was
any conversation about a classified memo.
</P>
<P>
He said ``a review of Justice Department records indicates that Mr.
Abramoff never met with the attorney general or me during our services
there.''
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokesman Mark Corallo said that Ashcroft never
met with Abramoff and attributed the references in the memo to ``a lot
of bluster to impress a client.''
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 1, 2001, memo was written as Abramoff's final contract
with the islands was winding down. He warned that the territory was in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
``I wish the situation was not as critical as it is, but
unfortunately our enemies have not gone away, just been beaten back,''
he concluded.
</P>
<P>
In a Jan. 4, 2001 letter seeking a renewal of his contract,
Abramoff bragged of bringing the territory ``back from the brink of
disaster. . . . It also allowed us to acquire some very powerful
allies such as (then) Majority Whip Tom DeLay.''
</P>
<P>
At one time, when his pitch for a renewed contract in 2001 appeared
to be failing, Abramoff sent yet another e-mail warning to island
officials complaining that he was in trouble with his law partners for
providing services without getting paid.
</P>
<P>
``They were not pleased that the work we did in January has to be
written off and feel we might be in violation of the LDA (Lobbyist
Disclosure Act). Need you guys to get me this contract ASAP,''
Abramoff wrote Feb. 5, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Although the contract was renewed shortly after that e-mail, the
reprieve was temporary.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff lost his CNMI contract in early 2002 when Juan Babauta
took office as governor, having beaten several candidates including
Fitial, the candidate of Abramoff and DeLay. Abramoff donated $5,000
to Fitial's campaign, records show.
</P>
<P>
Despite congressional defeat of the wage and immigration
legislation fought by Abramoff, the Marianas apparel industry has
suffered another setback with elimination of tariffs on Chinese-made
goods. Several Saipan factories have closed and moved to China where
labor costs are even less expensive.
</P>
<P>
But Fitial, still in the speaker post that DeLay's aides helped him
win, has not given up. He wants Congress to make it easier for island
garment manufacturers to satisfy requirements for claiming it was
``Made in USA'' -- reducing the locally produced content from 50
percent to only 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
``We don't have Jack (Abramoff),'' Fitial said, blaming what he
called unfair attacks on the lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
``We need the help of the U.S. Congress. Tom DeLay, he's the one
who can help us,'' Fitial said.
</P>

Washington. Times researcher Mark Madden in Washington also
contributed to this report.

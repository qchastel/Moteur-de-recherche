ABRAMOFF'S GRAND AIMS BEGAN EARLY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - In 1981, a newly elected president was about to
shift the nation rightward, and a 22-year-old Brandeis graduate named
Jack Abramoff - savoring his own victory as the newly
elected chairman of the College Republicans - was hatching plans
to transform the nation's young people into stalwart Reaganites.
</P>
<P>
It was the start of a career that would roil Washington
25 years later, and a phase of Abramoff's life that
provided signposts toward his later demise.
</P>
<P>
"Our job," Abramoff wrote, "is to remove liberals "from power permanently
- [from] student newspaper and radio stations, student governments, and
academia.
</P>
<P>
"We are replacing these leftists with committed conservatives."
</P>
<P>
As Abramoff saw it, the only hitch to his Napoleonic-scale ambition
was the pea-sized budget that his sponsors at the Republican
National Committee were willing to commit.
</P>
<P>
"With $250,000 it is impossible for us to run even a
skeletal field effort," Abramoff complained in a memorandum.
</P>
<P>
The memo was sent to the committee chairman, Richard Richards, after
a ride in Richards's limousine back from the White House.
</P>
<P>
His money pleas unheeded, Abramoff spent the next four years, from
1981 to 1985, bypassing the RNC chain of command -
the organization legally responsible for the College Republicans - to
build his own financial juggernaut to advance the group's hard-right
agenda, according to memos from College Republican files and interviews
with GOP officials involved.
</P>
<P>
Unbeknownst to the RNC, he launched an expensive direct-mail campaign that
left the group in debt, and vendors complaining about unpaid
bills. He set up at least two tax-exempt groups to
raise money - over the objections of an RNC lawyer
who warned that such groups could not legally engage in
political activities. He borrowed money for his cause, even from
his father.
</P>
<P>
"Jack was a freebooting pirate as far as I was concerned,"
said a Washington attorney, Mark Braden, then the RNC's house
counsel. "He had a strong belief in his own correctness.
It was damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead."
</P>
<P>
More than two decades later, in early January, Abramoff became a
symbol of Washington corruption when he pleaded guilty to a
range of crimes committed as a lobbyist. The scandal, which
has touched off a legislative scramble for reform, could also
snare members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Abramoff's critics inside the Republican Party say his tenure
at the College Republicans should have provided a crystal ball
into the turns his life might take. "Look how the
seeds of his current destruction are so evident," said Richard
Bond, who as RNC deputy chairman repeatedly confronted Abramoff over
spending issues.
</P>
<P>
Ronald Kaufman, then the RNC's political director, described Abramoff's management as
"living on the edge. ... I don't think any of
us thought he was an evil person. But we were
really worried about the group and the direction they were
taking."
</P>
<P>
"I remember them being in debt and constantly having financial issues,"
said William I. Greener III, a former RNC communications director.
"You had the sense of grabbing at air to try
to get specifics and details" about where the money had
gone.
</P>
<P>
Yet Abramoff also transformed the once-sleepy College Republican campus clubs into
a vibrant political force, enjoying access to members of Congress,
especially Newt Gingrich, the little-known backbencher who would later become
House speaker.
</P>
<P>
"This is really a tragedy in the literal sense," said James
Higgins, who succeeded Abramoff as College Republicans chairman. "Jack could
have accomplished great things with his unusual ability to lead
and inspire people."
</P>
<P>
Paul Erickson, who served as the College Republicans treasurer under Abramoff,
dismissed the accusations of RNC officials as untrue and ideologically-based,
saying Abramoff's critics were moderates allied with Vice President George
H.W. Bush, who "didn't want conservatism promoted in any sense."
</P>
<P>
Abramoff's top lieutenants were two figures who would achieve their own
prominence: Grover Norquist, the Harvard MBA who would become Washington's
leading antitax activist, and Ralph Reed, who would build the
Christian Coalition into a powerful GOP player in the 1990s.
Both remained close to Abramoff, and both have been linked
to his work on behalf of Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
An Abramoff spokesman, Andrew Blum, issued a "no comment" in response
to questions for this article. Norquist and Reed did not
return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
Neither Norquist nor Reed has been charged with wrongdoing. But the
fallout from the Abramoff scandal has hurt their reputations, and
ethical questions now cloud Reed's race for Georgia's lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
The Reagan pilgrimage
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1981, Abramoff, Norquist, and Reed joined thousands
of young conservatives flocking to the nation's capital, following a
70-year-old former movie actor who offered sustenance for their patriotic
hunger.
</P>
<P>
Under Reagan, there would be no more talk of "peaceful coexistence"
with America's Cold War enemies. "The time is now," Reagan
proclaimed, "to recapture our destiny."
</P>
<P>
Young conservatives were enthralled, after years of feeling alienated on liberal
college campuses. In Washington, they continued to view themselves as
underdogs battling the dominant liberal political and media culture. But
they brought to their cause the same question-authority irreverence that
had been the hallmark of leftist baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
While the College Republicans had been a one-time homeground for strategists
such as Lee Atwater and Karl Rove, the organization by
1980 suffered from sagging membership and political clout.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff's election as chairman - after a campaign that cost him
$10,000 - changed all that. He and Norquist brought to
Washington the same energy they had applied to organizing Massachusetts
campuses for Reagan. They could, and did, take credit for
helping orchestrate Reagan's victory in Massachusetts - a state so
liberal it stood alone in George McGovern's 1972 column.
</P>
<P>
Under Abramoff, the College Republicans office quickly became a nesting ground
for hard-right believers. The new team, allies recalled, berated Republican
moderates as "Bushyites" - a reference to the vice president
- and "squishes" who were too eager to cut deals
with Democrats on Capitol Hill, or with the Russians at
superpower summits.
</P>
<P>
After purging the moderates in the College Republican hierarchy, Abramoff and
his team launched a series of events to build public
support for Reagan's foreign policy. The first was its "Poland
Will Be Free" campaign to support the democracy movement then
under siege by the Polish communist government.
</P>
<P>
But in the eyes of the College Republicans, the Polish regime
wasn't the only Moscow puppet - so, too, were liberal
student groups, the American media, leftist professors, and nuclear-freeze activists.
Abramoff distributed on campuses 900 copies of a book called
"Target America," which posited that the Soviets had planted 4,000
journalist-agents in the American media to pursue a "massive secret
propaganda campaign," according to memos.
</P>
<P>
A training manual from the period, which Reed helped to write,
described Ralph Nader's network of Public Interest Research Groups on
campus as "tyrannical" and "radical." Abramoff's team accused the United
States Student Association - a 350-chapter liberal campus group that
in 1982 protested Reagan's student aid cuts - of being
a "pro-Soviet, pro-terrorist, Marxist-Leninist organization." The manual advised boycotting "Marxist"
professors, and soliciting support from alumni college donors to oust
them.
</P>
<P>
That kind of charged rhetoric repeatedly landed Abramoff in "hot water"
with RNC officials, as RNC communications director Greener noted in
a 1983 memo. "Bad use of words!" Greener scribbled on
an Abramoff memo that described efforts to "smash" PIRGs and
Uni d States Student Association chapters, and "drive the final
nail into their coffin sometime within the next year."
</P>
<P>
Abramoff was admonished by RNC official Bond after a letter to
the Palestine Liberation Organization went out over RNC stationery, according
to a memo.
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point where the CR's played it like
a war and Republican leaders rolled their eyes," Kaufman said.
"You couldn't trust them not to get in trouble."
</P>
<P>
That lack of trust extended to finances. Memos from the period
revealed Abramoff's intense focus on fund-raising and his readiness to
use the connections of his Beverly Hills based-father, a Diners
Club executive with connections to Reagan's kitchen cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"Alfred Bloomingdale, a close personal friend of my family, told me
to contact you immediately," Abramoff wrote to Roy Cohn, Joseph
McCarthy's one-time counsel, on July 8, 1981. "Although we are
an arm of the RNC, we must become financially self-sufficient."
</P>
<P>
Abramoff added that "because of his close association with the President,
Mr. Bloomingdale was able to free up the RNC contributor
list for our use. Within the next couple of weeks,
we must raise $50,000 in order to mail and phone
bank these lists. I have no doubt that we will
pyramid that $50,000, to over $1 million within the first
year."
</P>
<P>
Bond, now a former RNC official, characterized Abramoff's assertion that he
had gained access to the RNC contributor list as "outside
the realm of reality. That list is like the Holy
Grail ... You can see his early prevarication."
</P>
<P>
Bloomingdale died in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Champing at the RNC bit
</P>
<P>
Like other RNC affiliates - groups that represent GOP women, African-Americans,
and the like - the College Republicans were allocated an
annual budget. Abramoff's defenders say he was trying to build
a far more potent political force than other affiliates, with
a national program to train conservative activists.
</P>
<P>
"We fought, begged, and pleaded" for more funding, recalled Erickson. "We
were sick to death of being on the RNC leash."
</P>
<P>
In October, Abramoff sent a letter to state College Republican chairs
urging them to raise money through direct mail. By the
early 1980s, direct mail had become a popular fund-raising tool
for political groups, particularly on the right. But it was
also costly, and would lead to the demise of a
number of New Right groups.
</P>
<P>
A year later, the College Republicans had accumulated "rather large debt"
as Abramoff wrote in a November 1982 memo to a
second direct-mail vendor. Memos indicate that three months earlier, in
the summer of 1982, bills were going unpaid. "Dear Sirs,"
Abramoff wrote to a printer. "I would just like to
inform you of a thirty-day hold we are having on
all of our billing due to an interruption in our
steady cash flow situation."
</P>
<P>
The precise amount of the debt was unclear from memos, as
well as the memories of RNC officials. But, Bond said,
"speculative direct mail" by the College Republicans was "completely unauthorized."
</P>
<P>
So were loans to the College Republicans, but a July 1982
memo from Abramoff to his father, Frank, shows that he
borrowed $5,000 for the group. "If I had known the
CRs were out getting loans from people that they potentially
couldn't pay back, I would have stopped them dead in
their tracks," said Bond.
</P>
<P>
Determined to find financial footing independent of the RNC, Abramoff proposed
setting up a separate group, the College Republican National Fund,
whose income would be tax-exempt. But in a March 1982
memo, Braden, the RNC counsel, told Abramoff such a group
would skirt tax laws.
</P>
<P>
"Such organizations may not engage directly or indirectly in political activities,"
Braden wrote. "I received last week a print order for
stationery for the College Republican National Fund. This activity cannot
be funded through College Republicans, nor will the RNC permit
the use of its facilities for these purposes."
</P>
<P>
Memos show that Abramoff set up the fund anyway. As one
solicitation suggests, the fund had clear political intent.
</P>
<P>
"Thank you so much for your contribution to the College Republican
National Fund," Abramoff wrote to a Florida donor. "Because of
your generous donation we were able to fight Teddy Kennedy
in Massachusetts. Due to our efforts and other circumstances, Kennedy
will not plague us in 1984."
</P>
<P>
The College Republican tactics and unpaid bills led the RNC to
demand that Abramoff leave the building and move the group
elsewhere, former RNC officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Jack was a difficult person to work with from a lawyer's
point of view," Braden said. Disturbed by the College Republican
operation, "we threw him out. I don't remember what precipitated
it, but I remember [the incident]. It was painful. He
was a very difficult personality. There were all types of
management problems and a lack of trust between us and
them."
</P>
<P>
Bond and Kaufman also recalled asking Abramoff to move out.
</P>
<P>
Erickson, then a student who was elected College Republican treasurer under
Abramoff in 1983, disputed this version of events, saying the
RNC was reclaiming prime office space from the College Republicans
and other affiliates. Former RNC officials, he said, have an
ax to grind.
</P>
<P>
"It was open warfare in the halls of the RNC between
the Reaganites and the Bushyites," said Erickson. "Bond and Kaufman
were fiercely loyal to Bush and loathed Ronald Reagan."
</P>
<P>
"It had zero to do with ideology," Kaufman countered.
</P>
<P>
Greener, an early Reagan supporter who says he was "not a
Bushie in any way, shape or form," also recalled that
the disputes centered on the College Republicans' financial troubles and
unanswered questions about where the money had gone. "You could
never get a straight answer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dissent within the ranks
</P>
<P>
Questions about Abramoff's financial management prompted rumors to circulate within the
organization. One competitor in Abramoff's 1983 race for reelection accused
Abramoff not only of generating a debt but of embezzling
money that he had deposited into a Swiss bank account.
</P>
<P>
Nothing came of the claims, but they prompted one Abramoff supporter
to issue a letter to College Republican convention delegates rebutting
these "personal attacks and character smears."
</P>
<P>
A short time after leaving the RNC building, Abramoff set up
another nonprofit, the USA Foundation, soliciting money from such New
Right donors as the Olin Foundation. Although he organized it
as a nonpartisan, tax-exempt group, Abramoff served as chairman of
both the foundation and the College Republicans.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the foundation helped organize "Student Liberation Day" in support
of Reagan's invasion of Grenada. On College Republican stationery, Abramoff
wrote: "While the Student Liberation Day Coalition is nonpartisan and
intended only for educational purposes, I don't need to tell
you how important this project is to our efforts as
CRs. I am confident that an impartial study of the
contrasts between the Carter/Mondale failure in Iran and the Reagan
victory in Grenada will be most enlightening to voters 12
days before the general election."
</P>
<P>
By then, the College Republicans had been banished not only from
the RNC premises but also from the Reagan White House.
At the close of the Student Liberation Day celebration, Abramoff,
Erickson, and others traveled to the White House to attend
a reception for the American medical students who had been
rescued in the invasion. They were blocked.
</P>
<P>
"Deaver had crossed us off the list," Erickson recalled in a
reference to the Reagan adviser, Michael Deaver.
</P>
<P>
A year later, Abramoff left the College Republicans to pursue other
ventures. By then, his four-year tenure had made him a
divisive figure.
</P>
<P>
Erickson defended Abramoff, saying he was promoting the cause of Reagan
conservatism, not getting rich. "Jack governed by sheer force of
will," Erickson said. "Things happened because Jack willed them to
happen."
</P>
<P>
His detractors at the RNC took a different view. Greener said:
"I have found in life that individuals who believe what
they are doing is so right and so good and
so important are also the individuals that have a high-frequency
level of rationalizing away unacceptab
</P>
<P>
behavior."

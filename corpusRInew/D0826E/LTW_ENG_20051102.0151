Officials Contradict Each Other in Lobbyist Probe

<P>
Two former high-level U.S. Interior Department
officials clashed before a Senate committee Wednesday over whether one
of them -- while still in his government post -- sought to pressure
Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton on behalf of controversial lobbyist
Jack Abramoff's tribal clients.
</P>
<P>
J. Steven Griles, Interior's former deputy secretary, told the
Senate Indian Affairs Committee that he had no special relationship
with Abramoff and gave him no special access, as the lobbyist has
claimed in e-mails and at least one interview.
</P>
<P>
``That is outrageous . . . and it is not true,'' Griles said.
</P>
<P>
But much of Griles' testimony was disputed by the man seated beside
him at the witness table, former Interior Department counsel Michael
Rosetti.
</P>
<P>
Griles' efforts to insinuate himself into Norton's decision-making
sessions on behalf of an Indian tribe Abramoff represented so worried
him, Rosetti told senators, that he confronted the deputy secretary
before two other officials and asked, ``What was he doing? Whose water
was he carrying?''
</P>
<P>
The public dispute between the two offered a dramatic close to
hearings that have explored the complex web of influence, money and
access Abramoff wove as one of Washington most well-connected
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff has been indicted in federal court on six counts of fraud
and conspiracy for his role in the 2000 purchase of a fleet of Florida
gambling boats. He has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's hearing focused on whether Abramoff, when working for
the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, relied on Griles to influence the
Interior Department to block a rival tribe from opening a casino that
would compete with the Coushattas' gaming business.
</P>
<P>
Rosetti recounted an incident in which, he said, Griles gave him a
binder filled with letters and documents critical of the bid by the
Jenna Band of the Choctaw Tribe to build a casino one hour from the
Coushattas' $300-million-a-year casino. Griles, Rosetti said, wanted
him to make sure Norton saw the file.
</P>
<P>
Rosetti said he had to press Griles to learn that the folder had
been compiled by Abramoff.
</P>
<P>
Griles denied that he said the binder came from Abramoff, and said
he never knew who had put it on his desk.
</P>
<P>
He also denied published reports that he was pressuring Interior
officials on Abramoff's behalf as he was negotiating with the lobbyist
for a job. Griles said he was surprised when Abramoff introduced him
to a partner in Greenberg Traurig, the lobbying company Abramoff
worked for, who offered him a job at the end of a brief meeting.
</P>
<P>
Griles said the offer ``raised alarms with me,'' and he reported
the incident to the Interior Department's ethics officer. While in
office, Griles had been investigated, but was never charged, with
maintaining close ties to his previous employer, a lobbying company,
and its clients.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Wednesday by Abramoff's spokesman, Andrew Blum,
described the lobbyist as having been put ``into the impossible
position of not being able to defend himself in the public arena until
the proper authorities have had a chance to review all accusations.''
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday night, the Interior Department said
that its inspector general is ``reviewing all aspects of Mr.
Abramoff's contacts with the department -- both direct contacts and
those which may have been conducted by surrogates.'' That review, the
statement said, ``precludes further comment on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the
Indian Affairs Committee, said Wednesday there was no evidence of any
wrongdoing by Norton.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that ``despite Mr. Abramoff's efforts, the
department ultimately issued a ruling contrary to the position he was
advocating on behalf of his tribal client.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
The Abramoff investigation is one of several ethical headaches
confronting the GOP that Democrats have charged add up to a culture of
corruption in official Washington -- most recently the indictment of
Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis ``Scooter''
Libby, in connection with the probe of the leak of a covert CIA
officer's identity.
</P>
<P>
But Republican lawmakers have been watching the Abramoff scandal
unfold in the media and before the Indian Affairs Committee with
particular dread, because the lobbyist had extensive connections with
party officials and because his relentless pursuit of profit --
documented in a string of e-mails between Abramoff and his one-time
partner, Michael Scanlon, that the committee has released -- casts an
unflattering light on the role of lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
Investigations into his activities have led to one indictment of a
onetime government official; the former head of procurement for the
General Services Administration, David Safavian, has been charged with
making false statements and obstruction of justice in connection with
a golf trip Abramoff took in 2002 with Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, and
others.
</P>
<P>
McCain's hearings have focused on Abramoff's dealings with six
tribes. According to McCain, the tribes paid Abramoff and Scanlon at
least $66 million to advance gaming and other interests.
</P>
<P>
McCain's hearings and newspaper accounts have raised questions
about trips Abramoff arranged for lawmakers, including Ney and Rep.
Tom DeLay, R-Texas. DeLay has asked the House ethics committee to look
into his own travels and insists that he did nothing wrong.

FORMER LOBBYIST ABRAMOFF ADMITS GUILT, AGREES TO HELP POLITICAL CORRUPTION PROBE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - Former high-powered lobbyist Jack Abramoff, a longtime associate of
top Republican leaders, pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy, fraud and
tax evasion and agreed to cooperate with federal officials investigating
political corruption in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff's appearance in a federal courtroom to acknowledge his wrongdoing not
only punctuated a spectacular political fall but sent a shiver
across Capitol Hill, where much of the federal corruption investigation
is focused in an election year that will determine control
of Congress in the final year of the Bush presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department will pursue the investigation "wherever it goes," Assistant
Attorney General Alice Fisher told reporters at a news conference
after Abramoff's court appearance. "Government officials and government action are
not for sale."
</P>
<P>
Republicans, who have controlled Capitol Hill since 1994, could be the
hardest hit politically because Abramoff's links were the strongest and
most numerous to members of the GOP. Some analysts have
suggested it could rival the House banking scandal that presaged
the GOP takeover of Congress a dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
The unfolding Abramoff affair "has the potential to become the biggest
congressional corruption scandal in modern times," said Fred Wertheimer, president
of Democracy 21, a non-profit organization that promotes campaign finance
reforms.
</P>
<P>
In court Tuesday, Abramoff acknowledged to U.S. District Court Judge Ellen
Huvelle that he had engaged in a conspiracy involving "corruption
of public officials." But neither Abramoff nor his 15-page plea
agreement with the Justice Department identified any of those officials
by name. And Fisher declined reporters' requests for the names
as well.
</P>
<P>
However, the plea agreement detailed lavish gifts, travel and contributions that
match those Abramoff gave to House Administration Committee Chairman Bob
Ney, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Tuesday after Abramoff's plea, Ney denied any
wrongdoing in his dealings with Abramoff. "At the time I
dealt with Jack Abramoff, I obviously did not know, and
had no way of knowing, the self-serving and fraudulent nature
of Abramoff's activities," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff's travels with his longtime friend, former House Majority Leader Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, were already under investigation before Tuesday's plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff also is a longtime associate of other top GOP figures,
including Americans for Tax Reform founder Grover Norquist and former
Christian Coalition chief Ralph Reed, now a candidate for lieutenant
governor in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
He also was a top fund-raiser for President Bush's re-election. Howard
Dean, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, seized on Abramoff's
court appearance to call on the president to return the
more than $100,000 that Abramoff raised for Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Jack Abramoff is an example of the abuse of power and
culture of corruption that the Republicans have brought to Washington,"
Dean said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, at the White House, Bush spokesman Scott McClellan had a
limited reaction to Abramoff's admissions of guilt. "The wrongdoing that
he apparently now is acknowledging he was involved in is
outrageous," McClellan said. "And if he broke laws, he needs
to be held to account and he needs to be
punished."
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Republican and Democratic lawmakers have sought to distance
themselves from Abramoff, returning more than $200,000 in campaign contributions
he had arranged while he was earning tens of millions
of dollars as a lobbyist for American Indian tribes operating
gambling casinos.
</P>
<P>
The latest to do so was House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
who disclosed late Tuesday afternoon that he would donate some
$70,000 in Abramoff-related donations to charities.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the corruption investigation in Washington, Abramoff had been
facing trial on fraud charges this month in Miami in
connection with the purchase of a Florida casino cruise ship
company. His co-defendant in that case, Adam Kidan, agreed last
month to testify against him.
</P>
<P>
"Words will not ever be able to express my sorrow and
my profound regret for all my actions and mistakes," an
uncharacteristically contrite Abramoff admitted to Huvelle after pleading guilty to
federal charges of conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion. "I hope
I can merit forgiveness from the Almighty and those I've
wronged or caused to suffer."
</P>
<P>
The plea agreement could spare Abramoff the maximum sentence of 30
years in prison, but that depends on whether he provides
valuable assistance in the corruption investigation, which is believed to
focus on as many as 20 people, either members of
Congress or top congressional aides. In return for such assistance,
federal prosecutors will recommend a sentence of 9 1/2 to
11 years.
</P>
<P>
As part of the plea agreement, Abramoff is committed to making
some $25 million in restitution to his victims and pay
$1.2 million to the Internal Revenue Service for taxes he
evaded.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Abramoff and his onetime partner, Michael Scanlon, overbilled
their Indian tribe clients by millions of dollars and used
that money to shower golf trips, sports and concert tickets,
lavish dinners, skybox fund-raisers and campaign contributions on lawmakers, and
the lawmakers in turn performed "a series of official acts"
for Abramoff's clients.
</P>
<P>
They allege that Abramoff and Scanlon, once a top DeLay aide,
who reached his own plea agreement with federal investigators last
November, kept much of that money for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff's activities went "far beyond lawful lobbying to the illegal practice
of paying for official acts," Fisher said at her news
conference. "The Justice Department will aggressively investigate and prosecute these
types of cases which have a devastating impact on the
public's trust of government."
</P>
<P>
During the last six years, Abramoff raised more than $5 million
in campaign contributions, making him one of the most influential
lobbyists in Washington, a city where, according to a Washington
Post study last year, the number of registered lobbying firms
now totals more than 2,000 and the amount of money
officially spent by lobbyists exceeds $2 billion.

BIGWIGS COULD ROCK D.C.

The opening of the new Smithsonian museum honoring Native Americans
has been a cause of joy and celebration in Washington.
</P>
<P>
But the good news has overshadowed emerging revelations about a
sleazy political extortion scheme, allegedly launched by big-shot
Republican lobbyists, aimed at exploiting Indians.
</P>
<P>
Throughout U.S. history, "every kind of charlatan and every type of
crook has deceived and exploited America's native sons and
daughters," says Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. "What sets this tale
apart, what makes it truly extraordinary, is the extent and degree of
the apparent exploitation and deceit."
</P>
<P>
The unfolding scandal touches some of the GOP's most influential
elected officials and lobbyists, and could rock the capital before
it's over.
</P>
<P>
To their credit, it is two independent-minded Republicans -- McCain
and Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado -- who have exposed the
sordid tale and are trying to clean up the mess.
</P>
<P>
At the center of the scandal is Jack Abramoff, a GOP lobbyist and
longtime friend and political associate of some of his party's most
gifted strategists, including Ralph Reed, the former head of the
Christian Coalition and the Southern regional chairman for President
Bush's re-election campaign, and noted conservative activist Grover
Norquist.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff is a leading GOP fund-raiser, having collected hundreds of
thousands of dollars over the years for House Majority Leader Tom
DeLay of Texas and other top Republicans. He is also among the elite
group of "Pioneers" who pledged to raise more than $100,000 for
Bush's re-election campaign this year.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff was called before a hearing of the Senate Indian Affairs
Committee last week, where he spent the morning invoking his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
McCain, Campbell and other senators, wielding documents obtained via
Senate subpoena, charged that Abramoff and public relations executive
Michael Scanlon, a former aide to DeLay, have been running a crude
political extortion racket that bilked tribes out of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"All told, six tribes paid more than $66 million to Mr. Scanlon, and
Mr. Abramoff received more than $21 million from Mr. Scanlon for his
share of the scheme," Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
"In at least two instances, Mr. Abramoff and Mr. Scanlon sought to
profit by becoming involved in and attempting to manipulate tribal
elections," said Campbell. "Shortly after ... they solicited and
received multimillion-dollar contracts, aided by the tribal council
members they helped elect."
</P>
<P>
The scheme was crude and crudely executed, according to the documents
and testimony at the hearing. Abramoff and Scanlon would allegedly
work behind the scenes to scare Indian tribes into thinking that they
were about to lose lucrative gaming franchises. (Nice little casino
you got there ... it would be a shame if anything happened to it.)
Then the two GOP insiders would step in and offer, for mighty fees,
to smooth things over in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"Jack Abramoff, the tribes' trusted lobbyist and adviser, instructed
the tribes to hire Michael Scanlon for millions of dollars," McCain
charged. "But he never disclosed that he would receive about half the
net proceeds from the multimillion dollar contracts."
</P>
<P>
The lobbyists' e-mails, obtained by the committee, show that Abramoff
and Scanlon viewed their Native American clients with contempt,
referring to them as "monkeys" and "troglodytes."
</P>
<P>
The scheme generated so much money that, aside from pocketing
millions of dollars, the lobbyists funneled hundreds of thousands of
dollars to Republican candidates, and to the lobbyists' pals and pet
causes.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of one tribe," said McCain, "the funds were allegedly
paid from accounts reserved for tribal housing, education and health
care. That same tribe and another reportedly paid millions of dollars
into ... a self-proclaimed think tank run by two of Mr. Scanlon's
beach buddies, one a yoga instructor, the other a lifeguard."
</P>
<P>
Abramoff's high-ranking place in the capital's conservative
hierarchy, and reports of a federal criminal investigation, have
raised the profile of this particular scandal beyond that of the
routine influence-peddling flap.
</P>
<P>
"Even in this town, where huge sums are routinely paid as the price
of political access, the figures are astonishing," McCain said.

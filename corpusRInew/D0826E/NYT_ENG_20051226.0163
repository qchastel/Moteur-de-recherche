E-MAILS SHOW ABRAMOFF INTEREST IN DOOLITTLE ACTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
E-mails uncovered by a Senate committee show superlobbyist Jack
Abramoff had a keen interest in Rep. John Doolittle's unsuccessful
effort to block approval of the United Auburn Indian Community's
Thunder Valley casino in Placer County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff, whom Doolittle described as a close friend, had a tribal
client thousands of miles away in Louisiana that could have
benefited from the precedent if Doolittle and other critics succeeded
in persuading the U.S. Department of Interior to stop Thunder
Valley in 2002.
</P>
<P>
It's unclear whether the e-mails sparked the Justice Department's reported interest
in Doolittle, R-Calif., as its corruption investigation digs deeper into
Abramoff's connections on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
But nothing in the e-mails and other documents uncovered by the
Senate Indian Affairs Committee's probe of the scandal proves Doolittle
and Abramoff were working together on the tribal cases.
</P>
<P>
Doolittle's office, moreover, denied the congressman coordinated efforts with Abramoff on
the United Auburn casino, which ultimately opened in 2003. Doolittle
spokeswoman Laura Blackann said the congressman arranged meetings between the
Interior Department and local government officials but said he did
not attend.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff was watching the United Auburn case closely because the Interior
Department ruling on it could become a damaging precedent for
his clients, the Louisiana Coushattas, who were trying to torpedo
a Louisiana casino proposed by the Jena Band of Choctaws.
</P>
<P>
In both the Jena and United Auburn matters, the Interior Department
was being asked to take non-Indian land into trust --
essentially accepting title to lands on the tribes' behalf --
so that they would qualify for a casino under an
exception to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
</P>
<P>
The United Auburn matter came to a head midway through the
2001-2002 election cycle in which Abramoff and his tribal clients
contributed about $30,000 to Doolittle's campaign committees and just months
before the congressman's wife, Julie Doolittle, was hired in August
2002 to do fundraising and event planning for an Abramoff
foundation.
</P>
<P>
But those working on behalf of the United Auburn tribe said
Doolittle did not fully flex his political muscle with the
Bush administration to try to kill the casino -- another
sign that Doolittle was not necessarily advancing Abramoff's interests.
</P>
<P>
"We would rather that he had done nothing, obviously," Howard Dickstein,
the Auburn tribe's attorney, said of Doolittle. "But what he
did was ineffectual."
</P>
<P>
Still, the e-mails obtained by the Indian Affairs Committee, chaired by
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., show Abramoff was extremely interested in
what was happening with the United Auburn request.
</P>
<P>
-- Italia Federici, head of the Council of Republicans for Environmental
Advocacy, which was receiving large contributions from Abramoff clients at
the time, sent a message to Interior Secretary Gale Norton's
communications director in February 2001 that Doolittle was working with
Christian Coalition Director Ralph Reed "on the California and Louisiana
situations."
</P>
<P>
"It looks like Doolittle is not giving up and that the
conservatives a(re) being mobilized," Federici wrote.
</P>
<P>
-- A year later, Abramoff WCexpressed concern in an e-mail to
Federici: The Interior Department was about to approve the land
deal for the United Auburn casino, suggesting that he saw
it as a precedent that could "screw" his clients.
</P>
<P>
"I am really worried about this," Abramoff wrote. "What can we
do?"
</P>
<P>
-- A week after that, Abramoff associate Tony Rudy, former chief
of staff to Texas Rep. Tom DeLay, wrote Abramoff that
Interior Deputy Secretary Steven Griles was angry about them "bashing
Norton" over the United Auburn decision when, in fact, the
Interior Department had no other choice "because of the way
Doolittle wrote the bill" restoring Auburn's tribal status in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"He seems to be distinguishing how Norton would handle Jena (I
hope)," Rudy wrote, then added that Abramoff's team was going
to have to be "mega careful" on how they lobby
the department.
</P>
<P>
"Things are too hot right now," Rudy warned Abramoff. The 1994
bill to which Rudy referred restored the Auburn Rancheria's tribal
rights only after Doolittle had been assured the tribe wasn't
going to get into gambling. When the tribe changed its
mind, Doolittle rushed through an amendment on a year-end spending
bill that would give local governments a stronger say in
how such a casino was developed.
</P>
<P>
A 1997 Doolittle bill barring a casino near schools and churches
and requiring agreements with local governments failed in the Senate,
but became the basis for a negotiated deal between the
tribe and Placer County on the location where the Thunder
Valley casino was eventually built.
</P>
<P>
Other e-mails revealed that Abramoff and his associates were lobbying Griles
hard at the Interior Department, and in 2003 had even
offered him a job, though Griles testified that he doesn't
remember it that way.
</P>
<P>
Some at the Interior Department were suspicious that there was unusual
attention being paid to the United Auburn request.
</P>
<P>
Michael Rosetti, who was legal counsel to Norton, testified at the
committee that he smelled something fishy about the way the
last-minute questions about the United Auburn casino were drawing Griles'
attention, because Griles' duties at Interior did not include tribal
gambling.
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden there were meetings that Steve Griles was
chairing which had as its constituent members people from the
adjacent communities in the California area ... I thought it
was odd," he said. "I didn't know on whose behalf
he had interceded precisely and on whose behalf Mr. Griles
was exercising that inquiry."
</P>
<P>
Griles, whose memory was fuzzy on just about everything, told the
committee that he met with Auburn casino critics because of
an inquiry from a congressman, although he didn't name Doolittle.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the Auburn Rancheria," Griles testified. "Whenever I was
asked by the congressional office at Interior to meet with
certain members of Congress, I would do that. Out of
that they would ask me to meet with certain constituents."
</P>
<P>
The meeting to which Rosetti and Griles appear to be referring
occurred with Bureau of Indian Affairs officials in mid- to
late January 2002, according to former Roseville Mayor Claudia Gamar-Heinlein,
who attended it along with representatives from Rocklin and Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
She doesn't recall whether Griles attended.
</P>
<P>
"We thought the meeting had gone well, that they listened to
our concerns and were going to look into some things,"
Gamar-Heinlein said. "We were really surprised when a couple of
days later they announced that the department was taking (the
Auburn casino site) into trust without contacting anybody."
</P>
<P>
But Gamar-Heinlein said the only help the Auburn casino critics got
was from Doolittle, who helped arrange the meeting for the
group but did not attend or send a representative.
</P>
<P>
While the e-mails reveal that Abramoff saw a precedent for the
Coushattas if the Auburn deal was rejected, Dickstein said the
fact that Doolittle was not at the January meeting signaled
that the congressman was not going to battle the Interior
Department over it.
</P>
<P>
"We had heard rumors that (White House political strategist) Karl Rove
had been called, that Doolittle had set up a meeting
with Griles -- and these e-mails confirm that in my
mind for the first time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But it was significant to us that he did not actually
attend the meeting," he said. "We thought it was a
sign that he was not going to go to the
mat over this."
</P>
<P>
Doolittle's office essentially agreed.
</P>
<P>
"The congressman recognized that the tribe had unprecedented agreements with Placer
County and the city of Lincoln that addressed many of
the concerns of his constituents," Blackann said. "As such, the
congressman was not personally involved in these meetings."
</P>
<P>
Further, Dickstein said he knows of no involvement by Reed, the
Christian Coalition or any other Abramoff-connected groups lobbying against the
United Auburn decision.
</P>
<P>
"They were just getting organized right at the time we were
very far along in getting this approved," Dickstein said. "It
was as if they were just waking up to something
that was essentially a done deal."
</P>
<P>
Blackann said Doolittle never coordinated with Reed and the Christian Coalition,
as the Federici memo indicated.
</P>
<P>
"The congressman has never talked to Ralph Reed regarding Indian gaming
issues, and we are unaware of what Ms. Federici is
specifically referring to in her memo other than the congressman's
long-held opposition to the expansion of gaming in this country,"
Blackann said.

Lobbyist charged with conspiracy in widening congressional scandal

<P>
In a widening scandal affecting Congress, the U.S. government charged a partner
of a major Republican lobbyist with defrauding Indian tribes of millions of
dollars in a scheme that lavished golf trips, meals and campaign donations on a
member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Michael Scanlon, an ex-aide to former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, is headed
for federal court Monday on a conspiracy count contained in a criminal
information. This typically is a prelude to a guilty plea and full cooperation
with government investigators.
</P>
<P>
DeLay, until recently one of the most powerful politicians in the United States,
is not involved but is charged in an unrelated state campaign finance case in
his native Texas. DeLay left his leadership position because of the charges but
has denied them.
</P>
<P>
The Scanlon case, closely tied to Republican politicians, has the potential of
becoming another headache for the party. It already is reeling from the DeLay
case; the recent indictment of Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, I.
Lewis "Scooter" Libby; various allegations against Scanlon's lobbyist partner,
Jack Abramoff; and President George W. Bush's plummeting popularity
figures.
</P>
<P>
The eight-page information says Scanlon and a person identified only as
"Lobbyist A" provided "a stream of things of value" to a member of Congress,
identified only as "Representative No. 1," to aid their effort to pass
legislation.
</P>
<P>
It has been a matter of public record for more than a year that Scanlon and
Abramoff had a fee-splitting arrangement and represented several Indian
tribes.
</P>
<P>
Among the people subpoenaed in the Scanlon and Abramoff investigation was Rep.
Bob Ney, a Republican from Ohio, whose name surfaced almost a year ago in a
Senate Indian Affairs Committee investigation as having extensive dealings with
the two lobbyists and their tribal clients. Ney has denied wrongdoing and
started a legal defense fund.
</P>
<P>
Court papers filed by prosecutors say that Scanlon and the lobbyist "sought and
received Representative No. 1's agreement to perform a series of official
acts."
</P>
<P>
The acts, said the court papers, included "agreements to support and pass
legislation, agreements to place statements into the Congressional Record,
meeting with Lobbyist A and Scanlon's clients, and advancing the application of
Lobbyist A for a license to install wireless telephone infrastructure in the
House of Representatives."
</P>
<P>
Charges outlined in documents filed Friday said Scanlon and Lobbyist A cheated
tribes in Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Michigan of millions of dollars
associated mainly with Indian casinos.

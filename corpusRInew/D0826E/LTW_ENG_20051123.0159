Partner Pleads Guilty in Probe of Abramoff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A onetime congressional staffer who became a top partner to
lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe a
congressman and other public officials and agreed to pay back more
than $19 million he fraudulently charged Indian tribal clients.

<P>
Scanlon, a 35-year-old former public relations executive who was
once press secretary to then-House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas,
faces a maximum five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, but the
penalty could be reduced depending on the level of his cooperation
with prosecutors. His help is expected to be crucial to the Justice
Department's wide-ranging Abramoff investigation, which began early
last year after the revelation that Scanlon and the lobbyist took in
tens of millions of dollars from Indian tribes unaware of their secret
partnership to jack up fees and split profits.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are looking at half a dozen members of Congress,
current and former senior Capitol Hill aides, a former deputy
secretary of the interior, and Abramoff's former lobbying colleagues,
according to sources familiar with the probe who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. Because of his central role in much of
Abramoff's business, Scanlon could be a key witness in any trials that
arise from the case.

<P>
He admitted that he or Abramoff offered bribes on behalf of clients
over a period of four years.

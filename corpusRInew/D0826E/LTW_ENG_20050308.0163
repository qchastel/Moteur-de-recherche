GOP Luminaries Join DeLay in Ethics Investigation
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of congressional figures has joined House
Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, under an ethics cloud stemming
from foreign golf junkets arranged by a lobbyist facing influence
peddling investigations.
</P>
<P>
DeLay landed in trouble last month over a 2000 trip to Scotland
with the lobbyist. But two additional congressmen and three House
aides also played St. Andrews on separate junkets with the lobbyist
that might have violated House rules, records show.
</P>
<P>
And, like the Texas Republican, all omitted disclosing the key role
of embattled lobbyist Jack Abramoff. He privately raised tens of
thousands of dollars for private jets and boasted of setting up golf
junkets, according to documents, congressional testimony and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
One of Abramoff's golf guests was Rep. Robert W. Ney, R-Ohio,
chairman of the powerful House Administration Committee. He said in
congressional filings that his trip on a chartered jet in 2002 was
sponsored and paid by an obscure conservative think tank, the National
Center for Public Policy Research.
</P>
<P>
But the center's president told the Los Angeles Times that it ``did
not sponsor, nor did we pay'' for Ney's travels.
</P>
<P>
The same nonprofit organization also was listed by then-freshman
Rep. Tom Feeney, R-Fla., after he flew to Scotland with the lobbyist
in August 2003. But in response to inquiries by the Times, the center
said it did not provide ``a single dime'' for the Feeney junket.
</P>
<P>
Congressmen routinely travel as guests of educational and policy
groups, but they cannot accept trips and gifts from lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
The National Center's contradictions of the congressmen's reports
raise questions about whether Ney and Feeney violated House rules and
filed false documents to disguise gifts from a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest twist in a mounting ethics scandal swirling around
one of Washington's most prominent lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
Ney and Feeney, through spokesmen, blamed others for any filing
errors.
</P>
<P>
``It was the Congressman's understanding that this trip was
permissible under House rules,'' said Brian J. Walsh, communications
director for Ney. He said it was ``based on representations'' by
Abramoff that the National Center sponsored their travel.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Feeney expressed surprise. ``You are the first to
inform me of the information being incorrect,'' said Jason Roe, chief
of staff for the Florida congressman.
</P>
<P>
He said any false information would be ``the result of someone
misleading (the congressman), not any nefarious activity on his
part.''
</P>
<P>
In a statement last week, the Center said it paid for DeLay, his
wife, Christine, and others to visit London and meet with British
political leaders. There was no mention of the golf excursions that,
according to documents and Senate testimony, were arranged by
Abramoff.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff, among the most powerful Republican lobbyists on Capitol
Hill over the last decade, is the focus of inquiries by a federal
grand jury and a U.S. Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
The criminal investigation appears to be a sweeping probe of
Abramoff's lobby practice, based on interviews with witnesses and
published accounts.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Indian Affairs Committee is looking into allegations
Abramoff and a former DeLay aide bilked six Indian tribes out of
millions of dollars in lobbying and public relations fees.
</P>
<P>
Department of Justice and Indian Affairs Committee officials
declined to discuss their investigations.
</P>
<P>
At the time of his Scotland trip in 2002, Ney of Ohio was
attempting to amend a bill to aid an Abramoff tribal client in Texas.
</P>
<P>
Ney came to Abramoff's aid two years earlier on another case. He
took the House floor to publicly castigate the owner of a
Florida-based gambling cruise ship company that Abramoff was trying to
buy.
</P>
<P>
And before his 2000 golf trip, DeLay helped beat back efforts to
end use of low-wage workers in Pacific island sweatshops, blocking
legislation strongly opposed by Abramoff's clients.
</P>
<P>
Early details of Abramoff's role in the golf junkets emerged during
a Senate hearing in November.
</P>
<P>
A consultant to one tribal client of Abramoff testified that the
lobbyist told him he needed $100,000 to pay for Ney and his
contingent's golf trip to Scotland. Abramoff also told the consultant
that he had arranged a similar golf trip for DeLay in 2000, according
to the testimony.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff paid $72,000 from a personal business account to charter a
jet in advance of the Ney trip, records released by a Senate committee
show.
</P>
<P>
Since the scandal broke last fall, Ney has tried to distance
himself from Abramoff.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement Nov. 17, Ney expressed shock and disgust at
the ``duplicitous, immoral and possibly criminal behavior (of the
lobbyist).''
</P>
<P>
Previously, Feeney had not been tied to the Abramoff controversy.
</P>
<P>
Also facing possible ethics questions for the first time are three
House staffers who accompanied the congressmen on golf trips.
</P>
<P>
Like House members, staff aides are required to file reports on
trips sponsored by outside parties and may not accept travel financed
or arranged by lobbyists. They are responsible for knowing and
accurately reporting who pays for their expenses, according to House
rules.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff did not respond to questions for this story. A spokesman
for his attorney, Abbe Lowell, issued a brief response. He said the
lobbyist had been the victim of ``unfair attacks'' and that ``Mr.
Abramoff can only hope that people will not rush to judgment based on
negative and one-sided attacks.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Jack Abramoff rode a Republican wave into Washington, D.C., in
1994. Within weeks of midterm elections that gave the GOP control of
the House, he left Hollywood and swapped his movie producer role to be
a Capitol Hill lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
He was politically conservative, a former president of the College
Republicans, and had close ties with the new congressional leadership,
including DeLay.
</P>
<P>
His clients ranged from Pacific island territories to wealthy
Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
Trouble arose when some of his clients began to question the fees.
Tribal leaders told Senate and federal investigators that Abramoff
pressured them to pay millions of dollars in fees to former DeLay
aide, Michael Scanlon. Senate investigators discovered that the fees
secretly were shared with Abramoff.
</P>
<P>
Both Abramoff, 46, and Scanlon, 34, took the Fifth Amendment and
refused to answer questions before the Senate in the fall. One of
their former tribal clients has since filed a lawsuit alleging civil
fraud.
</P>
<P>
Controversy surrounding some of the lobbyist fees was first
disclosed in a small newspaper in Louisiana, the Daily Town Talk of
Alexandria, in 2003. It drew national attention after reports last
year in the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Senators, in a series of hearings last fall, criticized the two
lobbyists for ripping off the tribes by collecting about $66 million
in fees. Abramoff pocketed $21 million.
</P>
<P>
Those payments were described as ``exorbitant'' by a member of the
Senate panel, and they did not include lucrative lobbying fees paid to
Abramoff's Washington law office, the Miami-based firm Greenberg
Traurig.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff also pressed his clients to make what Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., called ``substantial political and dubious charitable
contributions.'' McCain, now chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs
Committee, said those payments warrant additional investigation.
</P>
<P>
A November hearing focused on Scanlon and Abramoff splitting $4.2
million in fees to help the Tiguas, a Texas tribe hard-hit when the
state closed their casino.
</P>
<P>
Senators accused Abramoff and Scanlon of working both sides of the
case -- secretly helping Christian conservative Ralph Reed persuade
Texas state officials to close the Indian gambling center, then
charging the Tigua tribe hefty fees to lobby for legislation to reopen
it.
</P>
<P>
Sarah Few, a spokeswoman, said Reed worked against the casino
because he was opposed to gambling. He had nothing to do with later
efforts to reopen it, Few said.
</P>
<P>
Scanlon did not respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the House Administration Committee, Ney was in a
position to help the Tigua tribe.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff told tribal leaders that the Ohio congressman could attach
language concerning their shuttered casino to an unrelated election
reform bill. Ney was the bill's author and as committee chairman would
be part of the House-Senate conference committee determining its final
language.
</P>
<P>
Six days after Abramoff said Ney agreed, the lobbyist asked the
tribe to send three checks to the congressman's political committees.
Checks totaling $32,000 were sent.Two months later, Abramoff asked the
Tiguas to pay half of Ney's golf junket to Scotland. Another tribal
client would pay the rest, he said.
</P>
<P>
Marc Schwartz, a governmental affairs consultant for the Tiguas,
told the Senate he ``received an e-mail from Abramoff'' suggesting the
tribe's share would be $50,000. He asked them to send it by Federal
Express.
</P>
<P>
The tribe did not want to pay. At Abramoff's direction, they had
hired and paid Scanlon $4.2 million and made campaign contributions of
$300,000 to Ney and others.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Tiguas arranged for their share of junket expenses to
come from the Alabama-Coushatta, the other Texas tribe that would
benefit from special language proposed for the pending legislation,
according to testimony and interviews.
</P>
<P>
Following Abramoff's instructions, the Alabama-Coushatta tribe,
through its casino, made out a check for $50,000 payable to a
foundation controlled by the lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
It was recorded as a charitable contribution to the Capital
Athletic Foundation, according to tax records. Corporate records list
Abramoff and his wife, Pamela, as the foundation's sole directors.
</P>
<P>
In August 2002, Ney and his party flew in a chartered jet to St.
Andrews' fabled golf course with Abramoff.
</P>
<P>
Others making the trip included Scanlon, conservative Reed, David
Safavian, a General Services Administration official, and Ney's chief
of staff, William Heaton, according to records and testimony.
</P>
<P>
Heaton reported to the House that his trip had been sponsored by
the National Center.
</P>
<P>
Safavian and Reed said they paid their own way. Safavian, who has
since been appointed chief of procurement at the Office of Management
and Budget by President Bush, said he wrote a personal check to
Abramoff.
</P>
<P>
Ney's travel report naming the National Center as sponsor omitted
any reference to golf. The purpose, Ney said, was to make a ``speech
to Scottish parliamentarians, attend Edinburgh Military Tattoo'' and
visit the British Parliament.
</P>
<P>
On his return, Ney met with tribal leaders in his congressional
office where he sang the praises of Abramoff, according to Senate
testimony by Tigua officials. He pledged to help get their casino
reopened, they said.
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., author of the Senate version
of the election reform bill, refused to add special language to the
bill.
</P>
<P>
The Tigua casino never reopened.
</P>
<P>
``My heart goes out to the Indian tribes ... who were duped,'' Ney
said in his November statement. He blamed the lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
``I too was misled,'' he said, by Abramoff and Scanlon whom he
called ``these two nefarious individuals.''
</P>
<P>
Ney said he was not ``even remotely aware that any Indian tribe
played any role (in his trip to Scotland).''
</P>
<P>
It was adirect and unambiguous denial.
</P>
<P>
``The National Center for Public Policy Research did not sponsor,
nor did we pay for, a 2002 trip reportedly taken by Rep. Ney and
others,'' said Amy Ridenour, center president.
</P>
<P>
``We were not even aware that such a trip had taken place,'' she
wrote in response to a reporter's questions.
</P>
<P>
The Center describes itself as ``a communications and research
foundation supportive of a strong national defense and dedicated to
providing free market solutions to today's public policy problems.''
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1982, it has an annual revenue of more than $6
million.Ridenour leads the center and her husband David is vice
president Tax returns for the organization show the couple was paid a
combined $275,000 in 2003.
</P>
<P>
After the November elections Ridenour wrote opinion pieces sent to
newspapers nationwide that urged Bush to address Social Security
reform and to reduce government regulation.
</P>
<P>
The center has issued several reports on environmental issues and
charges that environmentalists have engaged in ``a jihad against
corporate America.''
</P>
<P>
It gets most of its revenue through direct mail solicitations,
records show, and boasts of receiving no public funding.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff was on its board of directors from 1995 to 2004 and some
of his tribal clients were among its major backers.
</P>
<P>
The Choctaw tribe of Mississippi gave $1 million to the center,
according to Senate testimony. The Louisiana Coushattas, according to
a spokesman, were asked to donate more than $1 million but never made
the payment.
</P>
<P>
Tax records show that the center, in turn, supports Abramoff. It
paid an Abramoff-controlled company $1.2 million for consulting and
made separate donations of $450,000 and $250,000 to the athletic
foundation established and controlled by the lobbyist and his wife.
</P>
<P>
A year after the Ney trip, Abramoff was headed back to Scotland on
a chartered jet with Rep. Feeney.
</P>
<P>
And like Ney, Feeney reported that the National Center was the
sponsor of the August 2003 trip, picking up a tab of $5,643. In
addition to playing golf ``on two, possibly three occasions,''
according to a Feeney aide, the Florida congressman met with Scottish
business and political leaders.
</P>
<P>
Also on the trip with Feeney were Reed and two congressional aides
-- Mark Zachares and Bob R. Brooks Jr.
</P>
<P>
Both aides listed the National Center as their trip sponsor,
although the nonprofit agency also flatly disputed that. The aides
filed their travel disclosure reports with the House clerk's office
hours after receiving e-mails from Abramoff's Washington law office
that advised them and Feeney what to report.
</P>
<P>
In those e-mails, Abramoff's office listed the National Center as
the sponsor and provided figures for the costs of transportation,
lodging and meals. The aides used those figures on their filings to
the clerk's office, documents show.
</P>
<P>
Zachares, now a top staffer on the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, once served as a labor and immigration
official in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S.
territory. Abramoff represented the territory and its apparel
manufacturers at the time.
</P>
<P>
Brooks is chief of staff to Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La., who was then
fighting attempts of the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians to open a casino
in his Louisiana district.
</P>
<P>
The lobbyist also opposed the proposed gaming facility because it
would have competed with a client's casino.
</P>
<P>
Neither Brooks nor Zachares responded to questions from The Times.
</P>
<P>
The National Center, in acknowledging its sponsorship of the DeLay
trip in 2000, made no mention of golfing in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Its statement noted the trip involved ``significant policy
meetings'' - including a visit with former British prime minister
Margaret Thatcher.``We were then and remain honored that they chose to
accept our invitation,'' the statement reads, calling the trip
``consistent with our mission as an educational foundation.''
</P>
<P>
The trip cost $70,000 for DeLay and his entourage, records show.
</P>
<P>
DeLay, known as ``The Hammer'' when he became Republican whip a
decade ago, also was a guest of the center in 1997 for a trip to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The National Journal reported in February that Abramoff sought
reimbursement from his then-law firm for $13,318 in hotel bills
incurred on the 2000 trip, including $4,285 for DeLay and his wife,
Christine, to stay at a London hotel.
</P>
<P>
Payment of DeLay's hotel bill by lobbyist Abramoff would be
prohibited by House ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff bragged of setting up the Scottish golf trip for his
friend DeLay, according to Senate testimony and e-mails.
</P>
<P>
In a June 7, 2002, e-mail to Tigua consultant Schwartz, Abramoff
wrote of the upcoming Ney golf junket, saying it ``will be quite
expensive (We did this for another member -- you know who) two years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
Abramoff identified ``you know who'' as Tom DeLay, Schwartz
testified.
</P>
<P>
DeLay bristled when asked last week about the Britain trip, saying
he reported it properly.He brushed aside questions about the lobbyist,
saying that ``Jack Abramoff is not the only person I talk to in
Washington, D.C. I have a lot of relationships, hundreds of
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
Records show their relationship has benefited Abramoff over the
years.
</P>
<P>
In one case, DeLay helped stop a Republican proposal to tax Indian
casino proceeds. Abramoff's clients were among the leading opponents
of that tax.
</P>
<P>
Since the golf trip, DeLay has continued to help Abramoff's
clients.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, he joined the House speaker and other Republican leaders
signing a letter to U.S. Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton. The group
opposed a new casino in Louisiana that would have competed with
another club run by one of Abramoff's biggest clients.

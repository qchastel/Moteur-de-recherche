LOBBYIST'S DONATIONS ARE BEING RETURNED
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - Members of Congress who once counted on super-lobbyist Jack
Abramoff to help finance their campaigns have begun returning the
cash they got from him and his clients, signaling a
growing worry that ethics - and the scandal surrounding Abramoff
- will become issues that could affect close House and
Senate races in next year's midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff, a powerful Washington figure who owned a tony restaurant frequented
by members of Congress, is under federal investigation for allegedly
swindling American Indian tribes out of millions of dollars in
lobbying fees and contributions to Abramoff's associates.
</P>
<P>
With a court date looming Jan. 9 - and the possibility
that Abramoff will cut a deal with prosecutors before that
date - at least two dozen lawmakers have refunded money
they fear could look tainted by Election Day in November.
</P>
<P>
"They're obviously worried," said Michael Malbin, director of the nonpartisan Campaign
Finance Institute. "If people get disgusted by the relationship between
the people in power and the lobbyists, [Abramoff] is going
to become their poster boy."
</P>
<P>
If a lawmaker is not personally tied to any possible illegal
activity involving Abramoff, then giving the money back could burnish
his or her image with voters, Malbin said.
</P>
<P>
But if, as many political analysts suspect, some senators or House
members are linked to Abramoff and potentially illegal activity, Malbin
said, then "returning the check won't begin to take care
of the problem."
</P>
<P>
Montana Senators Max Baucus, a Democrat, and Conrad Burns, a Republican,
were the latest to return Abramoff-connected cash.
</P>
<P>
Baucus returned $18,892, including $1,892 he had failed to report for
use of Abramoff's skybox at a Washington, D.C., sports arena.
</P>
<P>
Burns, who has been targeted by Democrats in November's election, gave
back $150,000 in contributions before Christmas, reversing an earlier position
that he would not return the money.
</P>
<P>
"The contributions given to my political committees by Jack Abramoff and
his clients, while legal and fully disclosed, have served to
undermine the public's confidence in its government," Burns said in
a statement explaining his reversal.
</P>
<P>
A Burns aide said the senator has not been implicated in
any of the Abramoff investigations, and has not hired a
lawyer to handle the case.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff's dealings are the subject of a Senate probe and a
criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
Among the deals being scrutinized are contributions from the tribes who
hired Abramoff to politicians and political groups associated with him,
and overseas trips paid for by Abramoff and involving Tom
DeLay, former House majority leader and Republican of Texas, among
other political figures.
</P>
<P>
Capitol Hill sources have also suggested that Abramoff gave free meals
and drinks at his restaurant to lawmakers, in violation of
a congressional rule barring gifts worth more than $50.
</P>
<P>
Some political strategists and congressmen believe it's not necessary to return
campaign donations simply because the contributor is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Carl Forti, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the
committee has not recommend to GOP candidates that they return
money from Abramoff or his clients.
</P>
<P>
But on Capitol Hill, lawmakers are uneasy, worried that any connection
to Abramoff could become a campaign liability that far outweighs
the campaign help he may have given them.
</P>
<P>
Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who, like Burns, sits
on a congressional committee that oversees Indian tribes' issues, returned
$67,000 in Abramoff-related donations a few days before Burns and
Baucus gave back their campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
"Members of Congress try to hold onto as much money as
possible, until it becomes politically distasteful to hold onto it,"
said David Donnelly, national campaigns director for the Public Campaign
Action Fund.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that lawmakers who accepted contributions from Abramoff may face
serious questions from their constituents on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
"What it does is shine a very bright light on our
campaign finance system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Democrats intend to make ethics an issue against Republicans in next
year's elections, using the indictments of DeLay on money-laundering charges
unrelated to the Abramoff probe, and former vice presidential aide
I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby for allegedly lying to a grand
jury, to paint the GOP as a party immersed in
scandal.
</P>
<P>
New Hampshire Democrats have hounded the state's GOP representatives, Charles Bass
and Jeb Bradley, to give back contributions they received from
a DeLay political action committee.
</P>
<P>
Bradley has returned such campaign contributions; Bass hasn't, but has called
for DeLay to be replaced as the House leader.
</P>
<P>
Democratic strategists compare the current series of Republican ethics headaches to
the House banking scandal in the early 1990s, when dozens
of lawmakers were found to have repeatedly written bad personal
checks on their House bank accounts, some racking up hundreds
of thousands of dollars in overdrafts - without penalties.
</P>
<P>
Democrats believe the ensuing voter anger contributed to their loss of
dozens of seats in 2004, giving control of the chamber
to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
The Abramoff and DeLay cases, Democrats believe, could help them pick
up some seats next year and perhaps even regain majority
control of the House.
</P>
<P>
"My sense of this is that voters are cynical and angry
to start, and that more scandal just makes matters worse,"
said Peter Fenn, a veteran Democratic consultant and former congressional
staffer.
</P>
<P>
He noted that former House speaker Jim Wright, Democrat of Texas,
was forced to resign from Congress in 1989 because lobbyists
bought large quantities of his books, then handed them out
at fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
The Abramoff case "is clearly a much bigger scandal than the
House bank or a book," Fenn said.
</P>
<P>
But while DeLay limited his handouts to fellow Republicans, Abramoff spread
his money around to lawmakers and candidates in both parties.
</P>
<P>
According to an analysis prepared by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive
Politics, Abramoff and his clients doled out more than $4.4
million to candidates since 2000, with $1.5 million of the
money going to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
While Democrats seek to taint Burns with the Abramoff scandal, the
National Republican Senatorial Committee has gone on the offense, pointing
out that Abramoff gave cash not only to Baucus, but
to Harry Reid of Nevada, Senate minority leader and the
Democrats' leader.

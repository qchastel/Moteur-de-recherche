ASSOCIATE OF LOBBYIST TIED TO DELAY QUESTIONED ON CONTRACTS

<P>
The government of a U.S. territory in the Pacific
said Thursday that it had been unable to determine what
work was performed for a $1.2 million contract awarded to
a close associate of a Washington lobbyist at the center
of a growing corruption scandal here.
</P>
<P>
The no-bid contract to promote "ethics in government" was awarded in
1996 to David Lapin, a rabbi whom the lobbyist, Jack
Abramoff, later hired to run a now-defunct private Jewish school
in the Washington suburbs. The contract was one of several
totaling about $9 million given to Abramoff and his associates
that have provoked questions about the lobbyist's activities in the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
</P>
<P>
Those activities included a 1998 trip arranged for Tom DeLay, the
House majority leader, who is facing ethical questions about his
relationship with Abramoff. Democrats in Congress have also said that
two of DeLay's former staff members improperly influenced island elections
in part to assure that Abramoff continued to win contracts
there. Lapin's brother, Daniel, a Seattle rabbi who has long
promoted conservative causes in Washington, introduced DeLay and Abramoff, according
to the lobbyist, shortly before the Republican takeover of Congress
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In audits in late 2001, the Marianas government said that it
had overpaid for eight years of lobbying contracts with Abramoff,
that he had been paid without a contract in some
cases and that it had been difficult to justify his
hiring based on what work he did.
</P>
<P>
The investigations of Abramoff in Congress and by a federal grand
jury in Washington have looked into allegations of fraud in
his dealings with American Indian tribes, but two weeks ago,
the ranking Democrat on the congressional committee that oversees the
islands demanded that the investigation be expanded to include his
work in the Northern Marianas.
</P>
<P>
The islands, an American commonwealth with a large garment industry that
employs mostly Chinese laborers, hired Abramoff in 1994 to help
its government fend off legislation imposing American standards on wage
and working conditions. The contract was awarded by the then-governor,
Froilan Tenorio, under fire from the Clinton administration for what
it labeled the islands' exploitative labor practices.
</P>
<P>
The audit, conducted after Tenorio left office, found that the islands
had paid $9.5 million to lobbyists, most of it, $6.7
million, to Preston Gates  Ellis, the lobbying firm where
Abramoff worked at the time, and $500,000 to the firm
Greenberg Traurig for eight months in 2001 after Abramoff moved
there.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Abramoff had lobbying contracts with the textile industry trade
group there. Supportive columnists with The Saipan Tribune, owned by
the owner of the largest garment concern in the territory,
have said he is a star in Washington because of
his prowess in deflecting congressional efforts to tighten labor laws.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff's biggest year, according to the audit, was 1997, when Preston
Gates earned $3.1 million from the territory. Around that time,
the territories hired David Lapin. The Lapin brothers are from
South Africa and met Abramoff on one of his trips
there. Abramoff later helped Daniel Lapin found Toward Tradition, a
Seattle group that describes itself as working "against anti-religion bigotry,"
and remains a board member.
</P>
<P>
In a 2002 interview with The New York Times, Abramoff said
he first met DeLay through Daniel Lapin, who would meet
frequently with members of Congress to press conservative causes.
</P>
<P>
Pam Brown, the attorney general for the Marianas, said Thursday that
the government had been unable to determine what work David
Lapin had done. "We haven't been able to figure out
what the deliverables were," she said. "He was tasked with
providing some sort of ethical parameters for government work. That's
all I know at this point. We're more amazed at
the cost."
</P>
<P>
A woman answering the phone at Strategic Business Ethics in California,
where Lapin is chief executive, said he could not be
reached for comment because of the Passover holidays.
</P>
<P>
DeLay, whose foreign travel arranged by lobbyists has drawn criticism in
Congress for possible ethical violations, visited the Marianas in 1998
with his wife and daughter and three aides. Upon his
return, he declared dead a bill that Democrats had hoped
to pass raising wages and controlling immigration in the Marianas.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, DeLay's former chief of staff, Edwin Buckham, and his
former spokesman, Michael Scanlon, both of whom later worked with
Abramoff in his lobbying firm, visited the islands to persuade
two local lawmakers to change their votes for speaker of
the islands' House of Representatives. The DeLay associates wanted the
two legislators to support the candidate of the garment industry,
Ben Fitial, who was close to Abramoff, and promised that
federal contracts to the islands would follow if they did.
</P>
<P>
Buckham later represented Enron in its bid to build an energy
plant in the Northern Marianas, and when Enron lost to
a Japanese concern, DeLay worked to get the bidding reopened.
</P>
<P>
"For years, Mr. Abramoff lobbied to protect a Marianas industry that
exploited tens of thousands of women workers, many of whom
were channeled into the island sex trade," said Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif, who called for the investigation of Abramoff's work
in the Marianas.
</P>
<P>
He noted the audits and added that newspapers on the islands
had reported this week that Fitial admitted he had won
the speakership because of the work by DeLay's associates. "Given
the evidence in the public reports, it's long past time
for Congress to investigate allegations of undue influence and corruption,"
Miller said.

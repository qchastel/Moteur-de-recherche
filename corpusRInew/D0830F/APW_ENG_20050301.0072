BTK suspect's history as security company worker being looked at
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For about 15 years, it was the job of the man police have accused of being the
BTK serial killer to help keep people safe.
</P>
<P>
Before he started as a city code enforcer in suburban Park City, Dennis L. Rader
was an employee at an ADT Security Services branch office in Wichita, holding
several positions that allowed him access to customers' homes. He worked for the
home security company between 1974 and 1988 _ the same time as a majority of the
killings.
</P>
<P>
Police have not disclosed any evidence suggesting Rader worked at the homes of
the BTK victims. But his employment history has given police and Wichita-area
residents one more piece of the puzzle after being baffled for years about the
killings.
</P>
<P>
Rader was scheduled to appear in court at noon on Tuesday via video so
prosecutors could recite yet-to-be-filed criminal charges against him and the
judge could review bail. It was unclear whether Rader had a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Rader, 59, a churchgoing family man and Cub Scout leader, was arrested Friday.
He remains held in lieu of $10 million (euro7.58 million) bail in connection
with 10 deaths, committed between 1974 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
The BTK killer re-emerged in March 2004, taunting police with letters and
packages sent to media outlets. Authorities have declined to say what led them
to zero in on Rader, a married father of two and an active member of a Lutheran
church.
</P>
<P>
Police had long linked BTK _ the nickname comes from the killer's own writings
to authorities and stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill" _ to eight murders, but they
added two more on Saturday after Rader's arrest and said their investigation was
continuing. A source close to the investigation said he had confessed to six
killings.
</P>
<P>
"The guy is telling us about the murders," the source said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investigators in two nearby counties said Monday that they were
looking at old cases with similarities to BTK homicides.
</P>
<P>
Investigators remained tightlipped Monday about the investigation, going so far
as to hold a news conference to warn that public speculation could complicate
their investigation. Police Chief Norman Williams vowed that Rader will "not be
tried in the media, but rather in a court of law."
</P>
<P>
Williams reiterated Monday that police have linked Rader to the 10 slayings
blamed on BTK. But the source said investigators were looking into whether Rader
was responsible for the deaths of two Wichita State University students as well
as a woman who lived down the street from another known victim of
BTK.
</P>
<P>
Upset at the details reported about the investigation, Williams said he would
ask prosecutors if they can take legal action against members of the media. But
he did not go into specifics about what information was inaccurate, and he
refused to take any questions.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued Monday, Boca Raton, Florida-based ADT said it had
little detailed information on Rader's employment record in Wichita, but pledged
to cooperate with investigators.
</P>
<P>
Jason Watkins, part-owner and general manager for Alarm America, another local
company that sells security systems, said that while it's not required by law,
many security alarm companies conduct routine criminal background checks on
prospective employees. But he noted that Rader has never apparently before been
in trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
Mike Tavares worked with Rader at ADT and described him as a "by-the-books"
employee who would often draw diagrams of houses and personally make sure
technicians installed systems correctly. While Rader was known as a blunt person
and rubbed some people the wrong way, he never struck co-workers as anything
other than businesslike.
</P>
<P>
In the year since BTK reappeared, the number of Wichita-area residents
installing ADT-like security systems rose noticeably. In some cases, the waiting
periods for systems installations increased from two days to almost a
week.
</P>
<P>
"There was a little bit of panic buying," said Bob Collins, who has been in the
alarm industry for 25 years and is president of Comsec of Kansas. "The
psychological impact of his breaking silence after 30 years caused people to
reassess their security."

MAN FACING CHARGES IN BTK KILLINGS WAIVES A HEARING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WICHITA, Kan.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dennis L. Rader, the man accused of terrorizing
a generation of residents here as the "BTK" serial killer,
waived his right to a preliminary hearing on Tuesday, leaving
this city waiting still longer to learn the carefully guarded
details of an investigation that took more than 30 years.

<P>
The curious in Wichita -- who have seen glimpses of Rader
in court once before in a prison jumpsuit and earlier,
wearing his town code inspector uniform, in an old video
clip from a news story -- got only a brief
look at him during Tuesday's hearing as he politely told
a judge that, "Yes, sir," he did want to waive
the hearing. In essence, it was his defense team's acknowledgment
that the prosecution had enough evidence to go on to
an arraignment next month and then a trial.

Rader, 60, is charged with 10 murders, the first of which
occurred in 1974. In the years that followed, the serial
killer who dubbed himself BTK for his preferred method --
bind, torture, kill -- taunted the authorities here with grisly
letters, clues, poems, photographs and phone calls. After a sudden
flurry of new communications starting last year, the Wichita police
arrested Rader in February.

After the hearing on Tuesday, Nola Foulston, the district attorney, told
reporters that she was disappointed that Rader had chosen to
skip the preliminary hearing, which was to be the first
time the prosecution would explain how the police had tied
Rader to the killings.

<P>
Steve Osburn, one of Rader's lawyers, said that his client had
opted against a preliminary hearing on the advice of his
legal team.

Osburn said he expected that Rader would plead not guilty on
May 3 during an arraignment here.In jail, Osburn said, Rader
is meeting with someone from his legal team each day,
is "being very cooperative" and is, given the circumstances, doing
"OK."

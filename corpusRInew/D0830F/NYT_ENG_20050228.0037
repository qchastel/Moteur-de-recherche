RELIEF, AND BEWILDERMENT, OVER ARREST IN KANSAS KILLINGS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WICHITA, Kan.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those gathered inside Christ Lutheran Church on
Sunday morning, the lasting images of Dennis L. Rader were
simple, sweet moments. Just last Wednesday evening, for instance, he
stopped by the church to drop off spaghetti sauce and
salad for a potluck dinner before he went to visit
his mother at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Even as Wichita voiced relief at the prospect that one of
the most notorious serial killers in recent history might finally
be behind bars, those who knew Rader, the man the
police have accused of being the city's BTK killer, said
they were beginning to experience new waves of bewilderment, confusion,
betrayal and fear.
</P>
<P>
At Christ Lutheran, where Rader, his wife, his mother and his
in-laws have been members for 30 years and where Rader
began his elected term as president of the church council
in January, the pastor, Michael G. Clark, said he was
having difficulty grasping the possibility that the man the police
arrested on Friday was the same one he knew so
well.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the congregation wept during services Sunday, and crisis
counselors arrived at the church by the afternoon. Rader's wife,
Paula, was in seclusion, the pastor said, in "a state
of disbelief."
</P>
<P>
"We've known him for 30 years, and there's nothing that would
have suggested anything like this," Paul Carlstedt, one of the
church's 400 members, said as he huddled in the chill
with his wife outside Christ Lutheran. "We just don't know
what to think, don't know what can happen or go
on with people."
</P>
<P>
During those same 30 years, as Rader was attending Christ Lutheran,
raising two children, and working for a security system company,
as an address-checker for the Census Bureau and eventually as
a code compliance officer in his suburban hometown of Park
City, the police say he was also secretly tormenting Wichita.
They say he is responsible for strangulation killings, taunting and
explicit letters, poems and packages to the police and media
outlets.
</P>
<P>
BTK, as the killer had dubbed himself in one of his
rambling writings years ago, stood for bind, torture, kill.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the authorities here said that Rader, 59, had been
booked into Sedgwick County's jail, where he was being held
on a $10 million probable cause bond on suspicion of
10 first-degree murders, dating from 1974 until 1991. Prosecutors here
will probably file formal charges against him this week, Georgia
Cole, a spokeswoman for the Sedgwick County district attorney's office,
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rader, who has not been appointed a lawyer, will not face
the death penalty, even if convicted in the 10 killings
the authorities have him accused him of. Each of the
killings occurred before Kansas allowed prisoners to be executed.
</P>
<P>
Still, the authorities here say they have by no means ended
their investigation. On Saturday, when they announced Rader's arrest, it
was the first time they had publicly linked two new
killings to BTK. And investigators will continue to examine other
unsolved killings in the area over the last 31 years
to determine if they can be linked to BTK.
</P>
<P>
Richard LaMunyon, the former police chief who led the department during
the peak of the BTK search years ago, said that
investigators had long thought that six to eight additional killings
might also be BTK cases.
</P>
<P>
While the arrest, residents here said, may have answered some of
their biggest questions about the killer they had been wondering
and worrying about for more than a generation, it also
set off a new set of questions, small and large.
</P>
<P>
In a weekend news conference, law enforcement officials revealed almost nothing
about why they focused on Rader and what evidence they
might have against him. In the information void, rumors and
questions filled Wichita's airwaves and Internet chat rooms on Sunday:
How had the police found him now, after so many
years of looking? Why was Park City's public library suddenly
shut down on Friday during Rader's arrest? Who had supplied
the DNA sample that, according to comments by Gov. Kathleen
Sebelius, allowed the authorities to link Rader to the crime
scenes?
</P>
<P>
Janet Johnson, a Wichita police spokeswoman, did dismiss one claim that
had been reported on national television. Rader's daughter, who is
in her 20s, did not turn her father in to
the police, as some news accounts contended, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
In Park City, the small suburb just north of Wichita where
Rader lived with his family for most of the past
30 years, the questions were more personal. On Sunday, half
a dozen police cars and a maze of yellow police
tape lines still filled the neighborhood near Rader's house.
</P>
<P>
Donna Lowry, a neighbor, leaned against her porch wall, reflecting on
all the times she had talked to Rader in his
role as a city worker checking homes and yards for
possible code violations -- a job, all here say, Rader
carried out with no tolerance for even the most minor
violations.
</P>
<P>
In his uniform, with his badge and his marked city vehicle
and his cap with earflaps, Rader often pulled up to
her house, Lowry said, to complain about the way her
boat was parked in the front driveway or her German
shepherd running loose.
</P>
<P>
Upon further reflection, she wondered, Had he looked at her strangely?
Why hadn't she always locked her front door? Would her
15-year-old son get over the stress he kept talking about
this weekend when he learned that the man who had
once helped him when he was bitten by a dog
was accused of being BTK?
</P>
<P>
Back inside Christ Lutheran Church on Sunday morning, Clark, the pastor,
asked his followers to bolster one another in a "time
of craziness," and not to lose their faith.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that we show compassion and love towards our
brother Dennis Rader. If what is claimed to be true,
we should be about the business of asking for God's
help in healing of heart and soul," he told them
during his sermon.
</P>
<P>
"The truth from God," Clark added, "will free us from the
anger, the pain, the bitterness, the hardened heart, the release
from being lost and confused."
</P>
<P>
Clark learned of Rader's arrest, he said, when four police officers
appeared at the church's front doors on Friday. They had
a search warrant. Clark would not reveal what the officers
said they were looking for or whether it related to
Rader's role as church council president, but he said that
they told him they considered Rader a suspect in the
BTK serial murders.
</P>
<P>
Clark is still trying to fully digest what they were telling
him about the man who had sometimes run the sound
system in the building, had served as an usher and
who was in church just a week ago Sunday.

Dennis Rader, the churchgoing family man accused of leading a double life as the
BTK serial killer, was charged Tuesday with 10 counts of first-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
Rader made his first court appearance since his Friday arrest by videoconference
from his cell at the Sedgwick County detention center. During the brief hearing,
Rader sat with his hands folded behind a small desk.

<P>
The BTK killer, whose nickname stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill," was suspected
of eight deaths beginning in 1974, but authorities said Saturday they had linked
two additional victims to the serial killer.
</P>
<P>
Rader's arrest has also prompted nearby law enforcement agencies through Kansas
to reinvestigate any cold cases that bear similarities to the string of
slayings.

Police Arrest Suspect in `BTK' Killings
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WICHITA, Kansas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took 31 years and countless clues delivered by
the killer himself, but jubilant Wichita police Saturday named a
Lutheran church leader and government inspector as the notorious BTK
strangler, a poetry-writing attention seeker who murdered at least 10
people and dared the authorities to catch him.
</P>
<P>
BTK for ``bind, torture, kill'' -- always said in his taunting
messages that he wanted national attention and a catchy, tough-guy
nickname. He became so audacious that he once called 911 to report a
murder he himself had committed and strangled a neighbor who lived
just six doors away.
</P>
<P>
Only today did police formally link her death to BTK, whom they
identified as Dennis Rader, a married father of two grown children.
</P>
<P>
``The bottom line,'' Police Chief Norman Williams announced to
whoops and cheers at a City Hall news conference, ``BTK is arrested.''
</P>
<P>
Rader, in custody awaiting formal charges, worked as a compliance
officer in Park City, just north of Wichita, and attended Christ
Lutheran Church for at least 25 years. He is president of the church's
governing council. Pastor Michael Clark said the congregation is in a
``state of shock and bewilderment.'' He asked for Wichita's care and
compassion.
</P>
<P>
``If you asked me to make a list of 500 names, his name wouldn't
have been on it,'' one Christ Lutheran member said. ``A quarter
evidently has two sides and no one, obviously, saw the other side.''
</P>
<P>
Once Rader had been identified, details of his biography matched
leads and suppositions developed by detectives through the years. In
the 1970s, he worked at a nearby Coleman camping gear plant where two
of his victims were employed. He graduated in 1979 from Wichita State
University, where detectives 25 years ago found a photocopier used by
BTK -- and where they speculated he studied a poem he mimicked in a
later missive.
</P>
<P>
Wichita police have been embarrassed by mistaken arrests in the
case twice before, but they are confident that Rader, 59, is their
man. Dozens of law officers and politicians attended the news
conference, along with invited relatives of BTK's victims. The first
46 minutes were defined by congratulations and bear hugs.
</P>
<P>
Boasts about the teamwork and technology that finally led to Rader
were broad, but information remained scarce. Lt. Ken Landwehr, a
Wichita detective who has tracked BTK from the start, received two
standing ovations before he spoke. He then spent less than two minutes
revealing what little information the authorities -- determined not to
botch the prosecution -- want known.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the investigation, the search for the self-named BTK has
been a Wichita parlor game. The fascination hit a new peak Friday with
the arrest of Rader in a traffic stop. Internet message boards created
years ago to absorb the public buzz sizzled with theories and details,
including an unconfirmed report that Rader's adult daughter put two
and two together and alerted police.
</P>
<P>
In Rader's working class neighborhood, people wondered how a killer
could have lived in their midst while some felt they just knew BTK
must have been responsible for the killing of 53-year-old Marine
Hedge, a neighbor of Rader's on Independence Street.
</P>
<P>
``It's like putting together a puzzle,'' said Mary Dudley, county
coroner and director of the Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Center.
``It's such a frustrating case, with getting communications ...
taunting the police.''
</P>
<P>
It was those communications that drove authorities to distraction
in the 1970s but ultimately helped the case against Rader, police
said. BTK had a history of writing letters to police and news
organizations, sometimes mailing them, other times leaving them in
public library books.
</P>
<P>
``I can't stop it so the monster goes on and hurts me as well as
society ... ,'' he wrote after the early killings. ``It's a big
complicated game my friend the monster play, putting victims number
down, follow them, checking up on them, waiting in the dark, waiting,
waiting. ...''
</P>
<P>
What united many of the killings, police said, was BTK's pattern of
tying up his victims and strangling them, sometimes slowly. He did not
sexually assault them, police said, but left semen behind as evidence
of his sexual pleasure.
</P>
<P>
The killer's determination to receive credit for his work was
evident in the content and timing of his first missive, which followed
the reputed confession under police questioning of a young Wichita man
in the first four murders. The October 1974 letter declared, ``I did
it by myself and no ones help.''
</P>
<P>
But as the years passed, BTK went silent. The case grew cold.
Investigators moved on. Those who still thought about it wondered
whether BTK had gone to prison, moved away, died.
</P>
<P>
Then, in March 2004, BTK mailed an envelope to the Wichita Eagle
containing evidence of the previously unattributed 1986 killing of
Vicki Wegerle, a young mother. That letter was followed by another and
another, some including jewelry and documents stolen from his victims.
</P>
<P>
The police revved up a task force, brimming with local police and
state and federal agents. In November, Chief Williams went to
Washington and made a successful plea to the FBI for more help.
Forensics experts, using science not available in the 1970s, studied
DNA swabs that Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius (D) said linked Rader to
his victims.
</P>
<P>
By last month, the BTK communications had increased to include a
decorated cereal box that contained jewelry and was left by a roadway.
Its presence was announced by a postcard ostensibly from one S.
Killett. The return address was the home of BTK's first victims.
</P>
<P>
``I think he wanted to tell his story. He was providing enough
information that that was eventually going to happen,'' said Richard
LaMunyon, former Wichita police chief, who said BTK's writings
mellowed over the years, becoming in tone ``almost social.''
</P>
<P>
``The interesting question is why,'' LaMunyon wondered aloud.
``What drove him to come forward at this time?''
</P>
<P>
LaMunyon had always assumed BTK lived in the area, although others
speculated that he was a truck driver and occasional visitor. As it
happened, Rader raised his family in a humble Park City neighborhood
around the corner from his in-laws. He did not venture far.
</P>
<P>
``He'd drive through here and wave to Mom and Dad,'' said Patty
Loveday, 40, standing near a news media stakeout and police rope near
Rader's house. She remembers the horror and fear of the day Hedge was
abducted. Now she thinks of Rader's wife, who works at a local
convenience store, ``living with a person you don't know, for that
long.''
</P>
<P>
Across the street, Jason Day had nothing good to say about Rader,
whom he considered something of a jerk, ``like he was above the law.''
He, too, was thinking of Rader's wife, ``out of nowhere, finding out
her husband's BTK. You know this is going to rot inside her.''
</P>
<P>
At the convenience store, her co-workers were not talking.
</P>
<P>
One theme of the City Hall press conference was excitement that BTK
may be behind bars forever; Kansas did not have a death penalty until
1994, after what police believe was his final killing. Another theme
was vindication, with Mayor Carlos Mayans recalling how often the
police had been second-guessed.
</P>
<P>
``We knew that our officers were doing the job,'' Mayans said,
``and one day the nightmare would end.''

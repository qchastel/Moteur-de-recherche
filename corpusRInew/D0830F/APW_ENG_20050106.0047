A serial killer known as BTK may have taken a necklace from one of his victims
in 1977 and given it to a woman he was dating at the time, authorities said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The killer has sent several letters to police since resurfacing last March after
years of silence. Police said that in one recent communication, he said he took
items from the crime scene after killing Nancy Fox on Dec. 8,
1977.
</P>
<P>
Police are looking for a necklace described as a gold chain with two pearls.
Authorities are asking anyone who may have seen the necklace or received a
similar necklace as a gift in December 1977 or early 1978 to call the BTK tip
line.

"It is not that unusual for serial killers to take mementos from the scene and
perhaps the value to them is to help refresh their memory and relish the
occasion," said Howard Brodsky, a Wichita psychologist who assisted in the BTK
investigation in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

<P>
The killer's self-coined nickname stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill." He is linked
to eight unsolved homicides that terrorized Wichita, the first in
1974.
</P>
<P>
Police have received more than 5,000 tips since the killer resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
Brodsky said the idea that BTK had a girlfriend surprised him.
</P>
<P>
"Him trusting another woman doesn't go with my model of who he is, not
necessarily that my model is correct," he said.
</P>
<P>
In March, The Wichita Eagle received a letter with information on an unsolved
1986 killing. The letter contained a copy of the victim's driver's license and
photos of her taken after she was slain.
</P>
<P>
It was the first communication from the killer in more than two decades, and
police said it linked him to an eighth slaying. The other seven people were
slain in the 1970s, with BTK claiming responsibility for those deaths in letters
to the newspaper and a television station.

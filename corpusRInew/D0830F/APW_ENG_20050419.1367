BTK serial killer suspect waives right to preliminary hearing

<P>
The man accused of the BTK serial killings waived his right to a preliminary
hearing Tuesday, an acknowledgment that the state has enough evidence to go to
trial.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, which lasted only a few minutes, Dennis Rader calmly
answered "Yes, sir" to questions from Sedgwick County District Judge Gregory
Waller about whether he wanted to waive the hearing and whether he understood
his rights.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors presented no evidence against Rader, who was neatly dressed in a
gray suit and wearing leg restraints.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the low burden of proof, we didn't think there would be anything
new that would come out anyway, so we didn't think there was much to be gained
by having a preliminary hearing," said Rader's attorney, Steve
Osburn.
</P>
<P>
After the brief hearing, District Attorney Nola Foulston told reporters: "Of
course, there is a certain type of disappointment because it prolongs the agony
for the public to know."
</P>
<P>
Rader, formerly a city ordinance enforcement officer for suburban Park City, was
arrested Feb. 25 and is charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder. Rader,
60, will enter a plea at his arraignment, set for May 3.
</P>
<P>
The BTK strangler, whose nickname stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill," had been
suspected of eight torture deaths beginning in 1974, and since Rader's arrest
authorities have linked two more victims to the serial killer. Prosecutors can't
seek the death penalty because the crimes were committed before 1994, when
Kansas passed its capital punishment law.
</P>
<P>
Charlie Otero, whose parents, brother and sister were killed by the BTK
strangler in 1974, said in a phone interview from his home in Albuquerque, New
Mexico, that he was "extremely disappointed" that he would have to wait to hear
the evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
Otero, who had discovered his parents' bodies, also said he was anticipating
testifying against Rader. "I am looking forward to seeing him face to face," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rader will plead not guilty at his arraignment, Osburn said. He also said he did
not foresee Rader pleading innocent by reason of insanity and did not anticipate
a plea bargain. Defense attorneys have not decided whether to seek a change of
venue for the trial.
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary hearing, prosecutors need only to prove that they have enough
evidence to show probable cause that a crime was committed and that the
defendant did it.
</P>
<P>
Also at the hearing, the judge granted a prosecutor's motion to add more
witnesses, but that motion was kept under seal, as most court papers in the case
have been.
</P>
<P>
Rader, who is being held on a $10 million bond, is no longer secluded from other
prisoners, Osburn said. He has been sheltered from much of the media
coverage.
</P>
<P>
"All things considered, he is doing OK," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius proposed adding nearly $405,000
(euro311,634) to the state budget to cover costs associated with Rader's
defense.
</P>
<P>
The money would allow the state Board of Indigents' Defense Services to hire
another attorney, paralegal and investigator to help the three county public
defenders handling Rader's case. Also, the extra money would allow Rader's team
to hire expert witnesses.

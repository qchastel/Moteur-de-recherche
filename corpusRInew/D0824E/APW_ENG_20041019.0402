Flushing milk ducts not reliable for breast cancer detection [Hold

<P>
Analyzing cells from milk ducts doesn't reliably detect breast
cancer, U.S. researchers reported Tuesday _ dashing hopes that the
experimental technique could diagnose high-risk women sooner.
</P>
<P>
Because most breast cancer starts in a milk duct, scientists had
theorized that flushing those ducts with fluid might draw out
cancerous cells even before they could be spotted on a mammogram.
</P>
<P>
Mammograms work very well at detecting early breast cancer, but
they're not perfect. They don't work as well on the more dense breast
tissue of women under 50, so scientists are testing alternatives like
MRI scans to screen younger women at high risk of cancer because a
close relative had it.
</P>
<P>
The milk duct technique, called ductal lavage, is among those
experimental alternatives. To test it, doctors at Chicago's
Northwestern Memorial Hospital administered ductal lavage to 39 women
just before their breasts were removed for known cancer.
</P>
<P>
Doctors put an anesthetic on the nipple and inserted a threadlike
catheter to flush milk ducts with fluid that dislodges and draws out
cells.
</P>
<P>
Ductal lavage signaled cancer in only a fraction of these women, lead
researcher Dr. Seema Khan reported Tuesday in the Journal of the
National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
The test uncovered clear cancer signs in just 13 percent of the
cancerous breasts tested, and possible signs in 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Ductal lavage should not be recommended to high-risk women as a
technique to detect cancer earlier than imaging modalities" she
concluded.
</P>
<P>
Among the problems: There are numerous milk ducts in the breast, and
it's impossible to know in advance if ductal lavage produced cells
from the one that contains cancer. And even when it did, Khan's
research found the cells produced didn't always signal cancer.
</P>
<P>
The "meticulously performed" research supports an earlier, smaller
study that found similar failures, noted Dr. Carol Fabian of the
Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, in an accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
"Ductal lavage cannot be considered a sensitive screening tool,"
Fabian agreed.
</P>
<P>
But other studies of ductal lavage are continuing, to see if the
technique can be used to help evaluate women's risk of breast cancer.

BREAST CANCER RECURRENCE IS HALVED BY A MEDICATION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cancer drug cuts in half the risk that one type
of breast cancer will recur after surgery, the National Cancer
Institute and the drug's manufacturer announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said the results of two clinical trials were so
strong that the drug, Genentech's Herceptin, would soon be added
to chemotherapy as a standard part of postsurgical treatment for
some women. Indeed, the two trials were stopped about two
years early because they had already established that Herceptin cuts
recurrences and prolongs survival.
</P>
<P>
"This is a practice-changing result," said Dr. Edith A. Perez of
the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., the principal investigator for
one of the trials. Perez said the reduction in disease
recurrence was "the largest improvement in clinical research in breast
cancer in my lifetime."
</P>
<P>
The catch is that the results of the clinical trials apply
only to the 20 to 30 percent of women whose
breast cancer has a particular genetic mutation, because Herceptin works
against such tumors only.
</P>
<P>
Herceptin is already approved as a treatment for breast cancer that
has recurred after surgery or that has spread elsewhere in
the body. The two new trials were intended to look
at whether the drug might also work earlier in the
course of the disease, after a tumor is removed by
surgery.
</P>
<P>
Various chemotherapy drugs are already used for this purpose, which is
called adjuvant therapy. For certain cancers, so are hormonal drugs
like tamoxifen or the newer aromatase inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
The results of the two new trials, sponsored by the National
Cancer Institute, showed that Herceptin reduced recurrences by 52 percent
on top of those other therapies. After four years, only
15 percent of the women who got the drug combined
with traditional chemotherapy had a relapse, compared with 33 percent
of the women who got only chemotherapy, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
Other statistics from the trial were not provided. Perez said the
results would be presented at the American Society of Clinical
Oncology meeting in Orlando, Fla., next month. Conference rules, she
said, prohibit discussion of results beforehand.
</P>
<P>
The two trials, which began enrolling patients in 2000, involved a
combined total of more than 5,000 women, though the analysis
that resulted in the trials' being stopped was based on
only 3,300 of them.
</P>
<P>
All were so-called HER2 positive, a reference to the genetic characteristic
that makes a patient a candidate for Herceptin. All had
operable cancer that in most cases had spread to the
lymph nodes. All patients were given chemotherapy and some were
also given Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Clifford A. Hudis, chief of breast cancer medicine service at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, called the results
"big news," because using the drug in early-stage treatment could
have an effect on a greater number of women and
perhaps help keep them free of cancer.
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to treat a recurrent disease and it's another
thing to prevent a recurrence outright," Hudis said. "If you
don't have a recurrence of breast cancer you can't die
of the disease."
</P>
<P>
But he said he thought doctors should wait for the full
data before deciding whether to give Herceptin to patients after
surgery. The drug can cause heart problems, and the clinical
trial data should be analyzed to see how severe these
side effects are, he said.
</P>
<P>
Herceptin, given intravenously, is intended to block a particular protein that
juts out of tumor cells and spurs them to grow
when it is activated. The 20 to 30 percent of
tumors that Herceptin is approved to treat have an abnormally
high level of this protein, called HER2. These tumors tend
to be aggressive and may be less likely to be
held in check by tamoxifen, doctors said, so there is
a particular need for new ways to treat them.
</P>
<P>
The results are more good news for Genentech. Use of Herceptin
earlier in breast cancer will mean a bigger market for
the drug, which last year had sales of $483 million.
Genentech said that 34,000 women a year get adjuvant treatment
for HER2-positive breast cancer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the last few weeks two other trials involving another
Genentech cancer drug, Avastin, were stopped early after that drug,
already approved for colon cancer, was shown to work for
lung cancer and breast cancer as well.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the company, based in South San Francisco, Calif., said Monday
that with demand for Avastin and Herceptin expected to grow
faster than expected, it would have to review its plans
to make sure it has enough manufacturing capacity.
</P>
<P>
Genentech stock has risen more than 50 percent in the last
six weeks and the company is now neck and neck
with the larger Amgen as the most valuable company in
biotechnology, with a market capitalization of about $73 billion.
</P>
<P>
The announcement Monday came after the close of regular trading, in
which Genentech's shares fell 41 cents to $69.43. But in
after-hours trading the stock was up to $76.50.

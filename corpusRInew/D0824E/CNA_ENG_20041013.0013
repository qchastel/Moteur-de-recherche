The National Health Research Institutes
(NHRI) Wednesday established a strategic alliance with U.S.-based
Bridge Pharmaceuticals on the research and development of cancer
medicines.
</P>
<P>
The first cooperation project between the two sides will be the
clinical development in Taiwan of two new cancer medicines, SR-13668
and SR-16158, NHRI officials said.
</P>
<P>
The two medicines have been tested on animals in the United
States and have been shown to be effective in inhibiting the growth
of cancer cells, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of clinical trials on humans is expected to start
next year in Taiwan, they said.
</P>
<P>
The SR-13668 is for oral consumption and can curb the AKT
retroviral oncogene protein, which is extremely active in patients
with malignant tumors, including breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate
cancer, liver cancer, ovary cancer and colon cancer, according to the
NHRI.
</P>
<P>
The SR-16158, meanwhile, is intended for the treatment of breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Whang-Peng, director of the NHRI's Division of Cancer
Research, said that compared with existing cancer medicines, the two
drugs have produced better therapeutic results and less side effects.
</P>
<P>
Compared with hormonal drugs, SR-16158 is less likely to trigger
cardiovascular disease in patients, Whang-Peng said.
</P>
<P>
She said the two new medicines will be available on the market
three years from now at the earliest if the clinical trials proceed
smoothly.

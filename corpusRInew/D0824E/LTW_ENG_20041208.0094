New Drug May Reduce Breast Cancer Recurrence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new type of drug shows growing promise as a more potent way for
many breast cancer patients to significantly cut their risk of a
recurrence, researchers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest findings from a large international study also found
that the drug, called an aromatase inhibitor, appears to sharply
reduce the chances that many breast cancer patients will develop a new
cancer in the other breast or have the cancer spread elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The results were so strong that researchers recommended that most
postmenopausal women struck by breast cancer should immediately begin
taking an aromatase inhibitor as soon as they complete the standard
regimen of surgery, radiation and, often, chemotherapy, instead first
going on an older drug.
</P>
<P>
Other experts praised the findings as confirming that aromatase
inhibitors should play an important role in treating breast cancer
patients but said it remains unclear whether all eligible women should
immediately begin an aromatase inhibitor. Some patients might still
first try the older drug, tamoxifen, they said.
</P>
<P>
``This is a very large study and it confirms there is a benefit and
that aromatase inhibitors should become part of standard therapy,''
said JoAnne Zujewski of the National Cancer Institute. ``But the exact
timing of how one should use them remains unclear.''
</P>
<P>
Before the development of aromatase inhibitors, women whose breast
cancers were promoted by the hormone estrogen -- which is true of most
-- were given tamoxifen to reduce their risk of recurrence. Tamoxifen
blunts estrogen's effects. But tamoxifen can be taken only for five
years and increases the risk of uterine cancer and blood clots that
can cause strokes.
</P>
<P>
Aromatase inhibitors block the formation of estrogen in the first
place and carry none of those risks. They do not, however, reduce the
risk of osteoporosis, as tamoxifen does.
</P>
<P>
But it's been unclear whether women should take tamoxifen first and
then switch to an aromatase inhibitor, or simply take an aromatase
inhibitor from the start.
</P>
<P>
The new findings are from a study involving 9,366 postmenopausal
women with early, estrogen-sensitive breast cancer who took either
tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor called Arimidex (known generically
as anastrozole).
</P>
<P>
The researchers had previously reported data from three years of
study that showed Arimidex prevented more recurrences than tamoxifen.
The new data found the benefits continued after five years and
appeared to be even greater, the researchers said. Tamoxifen cut the
recurrence risk by about 50 percent; Arimidex appeared to reduce
recurrence by an extra 26 percent, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
``We think women should start right away with an aromatase
inhibitor,'' said Anthony Howell of the Christie Hospital in
Manchester, England, who presented the findings at a meeting in San
Antonio, Texas. ``We think the benefit justifies offering this
treatment as early as possible.''
</P>
<P>
Other research presented at the meeting found that switching to
Arimidex or another aromatase inhibitor, called Aromasin, was more
effective than staying on tamoxifen for five years.
</P>
<P>
``This data strengthens the thinking that tamoxifen is tending to
die out as a treatment and is being replaced by these aromatase
inhibitors,'' Howell said.
</P>
<P>
But other experts said the data simply confirmed the study's
earlier findings and that the results of other ongoing studies were
needed before changing the standard recommendations.
</P>
<P>
``I would say that these results generally provide confirmation of
what was previously seen in this trial but are not strikingly
different,'' said Eric Winer of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in
Boston. Winer chaired a panel for the American Society of Clinical
Oncology that last month recommended that aromatase inhibitors become
part of the standard arsenal of drugs used to treat breast cancer, but
that the exact strategy of how to use them remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
``We still should be careful not to rush to judgment as to what the
best way should be to use these drugs,'' Winer said.
</P>
<P>
The new study was funded by AstraZeneca, which makes the drug, but
Howell said the researchers had complete independence.

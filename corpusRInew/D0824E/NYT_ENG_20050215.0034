DOCTORS PROBE LINK BETWEEN THYROID AND BREAST CANCER

An underactive thyroid gland -- a condition afflicting
as many as 20 percent of older women -- also
apparently lessens a woman's chances of developing an aggressive form
of breast cancer, according to a study that provides new
evidence for a long-debated link.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center found
that women who were diagnosed with hypothyroidism were less likely
to have breast cancer, and those who did were likely
to have a less-aggressive form of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The study spotlights the role that hormones besides estrogen play in
development and progression of the hormone-sensitive cancer, said Dr. Massimo
Cristofanilli, an associate professor of breast oncology and the lead
author of the study. The results could help researchers develop
new medications for treatment and prevention of breast cancer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been focusing only on one hormone acting on the
breast tissue, but there is a variety of other hormones
that create the environment for the development of cancer," Cristofanilli
said. "Thyroid appears to be one of them."
</P>
<P>
Scientists long have been intrigued by the role of the thyroid
gland in breast disease. More than a century ago, a
doctor in Scotland fed thyroid hormone to women whose breast
cancer had spread throughout their body.
</P>
<P>
Since then, smaller studies on women with several thyroid conditions have
generated conflicting results.
</P>
<P>
The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the
neck that produces a variety of hormones regulating body metabolism.
Thyroid hormones affect growth, fertility and the body's use of
nutrients and oxygen.
</P>
<P>
Hypothyroidism occurs when production of these vital hormones slows down. Symptoms
can include dry skin, weight gain, sensitivity to cold, forgetfulness
and fertility problems. The cause is unknown, although some evidence
points to an immune system malfunction, Cristofanilli noted.
</P>
<P>
The study was published Monday in the online journal Cancer, a
publication of the American Cancer Society. Scientists compared 1,036 women
who had been treated for breast cancer to 1,088 healthy
women who had attended the hospital's screening clinics.
</P>
<P>
Women with underactive thyroid glands had a 61 percent lower risk
of having invasive breast cancer, or aggressive cancer that had
spread into surrounding breast tissue or lymph nodes. Cristofanilli noted
that the women with underactive thyroid glands all were taking
thyroid hormone replacements, which suggests it is not the thyroid
hormone level itself that influences the growth of breast cancer.
He said doctors need to study whether the immune system
response in these women is playing some role in slowing
or preventing breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
"This is good news, because it indicates that the condition that
brings out hypothyroidism is protective enough that it either delays
or creates the possibility of developing a less aggressive form
of the disease," he said.

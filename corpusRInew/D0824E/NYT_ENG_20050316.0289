WITH ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY, STUDY SHOWS RADIATION THERAPY DOESN'T INCREASE HEART DISEASE RISK FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS

Local researchers have found that radiation therapy likely no
longer leaves breast cancer patients at an increased risk of
potentially deadly heart disease.
</P>
<P>
A study by researchers at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center shows the risk, significant in the 1960s and
1970s, has steadily declined over the past 25 years until
it is now probably gone.
</P>

"To the best of our knowledge, radiation is safe for breast
cancer patients," said Dr. Sharon Giordano, the study's lead author
and a professor in M.D. Anderson's department of breast medical
oncology. "This is great news that should allow women to
choose to have radiation without fear it could cause heart
disease."
</P>
<P>
But Giordano cautioned that long-term follow-up is needed because the effects
of radiation near the heart may not show up until
15 years after treatment. It has not been that long
for some of the patients in the study.
</P>
<P>
Giordano attributed the improvement to advances in technology and techniques that
enable therapists to individualize radiation treatment, better targeting each patient's
tumor. In the past, she said, it really was "one
size fits all."
</P>
<P>
Doctors have been telling patients for years that radiation is much
safer than it used to be, but the study is
the first to offer evidence to support the position. The
study was published in Wednesday's Journal of the National Cancer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Following surgery, close to 50 percent of women with breast cancer
undergo radiation, which can cut the odds of cancer returning
by two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
But studies in the '60s and '70s showed radiation for breast
cancer also exposed the heart in women with left-sided tumors
and increased their risk of heart attack and dying from
heart disease. It continued to be used because the benefit
was greater than the risk.
</P>
<P>
Giordano and colleagues studied the records of more than 27,000 women
treated for breast cancer from 1973 to 1989 -- 13,998
with cancer in the left breast (near the heart) and
13,285 with cancer in the right breast.
</P>
<P>
Of the women who underwent surgery in the 1970s, the death
rate for heart disease among those with tumors on the
left side was 13.1 percent. It was 10.2 percent for
those with right-breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
But during the 1980s, the risk declined by 6 percent annually
in women with left-sided breast cancer compared with those with
the disease on their right side, according to the study.
The heart disease death rate of both groups diagnosed during
the decade was about 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Jack Cuzick of London's Wolfson Institute
of Preventive Medicine said follow-up is "essential" to obtain "definitive
evidence" the risk has been completely eliminated. Giordano said the
team has such follow-up plans.

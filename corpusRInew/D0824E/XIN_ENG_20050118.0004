Deficiencies in the ability of
cells to repair damaged DNA are associated with an increased risk 
of breast cancer, researchers at Columbia University said Monday.

A latest study led by Regina Santella at the Columbia 
University School of Public Health is due to published in the Jan.
19 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

DNA repair is the system of defenses designed to protect the 
integrity of the genome. Earlier studies have suggested that 
deficiency in cells' capacity for DNA repair contributes to the 
accumulation of DNA damage and accelerates the genetic changes 
leading to cancer.

To evaluate whether weakened DNA repair capacity in the 
nucleotide excision pathway that fixes DNA alterations known as 
bulky DNA adducts is associated with breast cancer risk, Santella 
and colleagues analyzed cell lines generated from blood samples 
from pairs of sisters, in which one had been diagnosed with breast
cancer but the other had not.
</P>
<P>
They found that DNA repair capacity was lower in breast cancer 
patients than in the control subjects. Deficient DNA repair 
capacity was associated with a twofold increase in the risk of 
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
In addition, when the data were stratified into quartiles of 
DNA repair capacity, the risk of breast cancer was three times 
higher among women with the poorest DNA repair capacity compared 
with those with the highest.
</P>
<P>
"These data support the hypothesis that deficient DNA repair 
capacity is associated with susceptibility to breast cancer and 
may be a valuable in vitro biomarker to identify high-risk 
subjects, especially in familial breast cancer families," 
researchers wrote in their paper.
</P>
<P>
"It is unclear at this time whether there are any interventions
that could alter DNA repair capacity and what effect such 
interventions might have on risk," they said.
</P>
<P>
Other scientists remarked on the need for developing better 
laboratory tests for such studies.
</P>
<P>
"When DNA repair capacity can be measured easily and quickly, 
the scientific community will be able to clearly understand the 
role of DNA repair capacity in the development of cancer and 
possibly to develop interventions to reduce cancer incidence and 
mortality," they wrote in an editorial in the journal.

<P>
Women with benign breast lesions 
bear a higher risk of eventually developing breast cancer, according 
to a study released Wednesday in the United States.

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 
gave evidence for the need for women whose biopsies of breast 
lesions proved benign to remain wary of the possibility that a 
malignancy could later develop.

"Our findings indicate a link between select types of benign 
breast lesions and the later development of breast cancer," said 
Lynn Hartmann, an oncologist with the Mayo Clinic who led the 
study.

"Women who have a breast biopsy that is benign must discuss the 
possibility of additional risks with their doctors," Hartmann said.

The Mayo team, which is examining risk factors related to breast 
cancer, showed after tests on 9,087 women that the most common types 
of benign lesions, those classified as non-proliferative, do not 
increase the risk of a susequent malignancy.
</P>
<P>
However, proliferative lesions that were benign in a biopsy were 
shown to have a high correlation to the later development of breast 
cancer.
</P>
<P>
More than one million women each year have biopsies of breast 
lesions that turn up benign, the report said.

Oral contraceptives reduce breast cancer in high-risk group: 
Australian study

<P>
An Australian research suggests 
that taking oral contraceptives reduces the risk of breast cancer 
carrying breast cancer genes.
</P>
<P>
The study found those with an inherited mutation in the BRCA1 
gene, a known risk factor for early onset breast cancer, were 
about four times less likely to develop the disease if they were 
taking oral contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by researchers from University of 
Melbourne on some 2,000 women under the age of 40, including 1,156
breast cancer patients in Australia, Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The findings go against the researchers' original hypothesis 
that the pill would increase breast cancer in high risk groups.

<P>
"We really thought that oral contraceptives would be bad," John
Hopper, director of the university's Center for Genetic 
Epidemiology, was quoted by  Australian Associated Press as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study suggested young women who carried inherited 
variations of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes should not be discouraged 
from using oral contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe that you can say oral contraceptive use is 
going to be the magic elixir yet but we do say that the use of 
oral contraceptives should not be contraindicated (in women with a
high genetic breast cancer risk),"  Hopper said.
</P>
<P>
"There's no strong guidelines but, in general, women are being 
advised cautiously not to use oral contraceptives if they are 
carriers ... but that's not necessarily found in evidence," he 
said.
</P>
<P>
"They definitely have the power to make life decisions about 
the use of oral contraceptives not worrying overly about the 
effect it may have on their breast cancer risks," he said.

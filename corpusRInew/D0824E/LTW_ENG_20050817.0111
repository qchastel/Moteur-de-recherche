Breast-Cancer Study Finds French-Fry Link
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A study examining the role childhood diet plays in breast cancer
has found an association between eating French fries regularly during
the preschool years and developing breast cancer as an adult.
</P>
<P>
Each weekly serving of French fries girls consumed between ages 3
and 5 increased their risk of developing breast cancer as adults by 27
percent, according to researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital and
the Harvard School of Public Health.

<P>
The association was not found with potatoes prepared in other ways.
</P>
<P>
The finding is the first of its kind and must be confirmed by other
studies, said lead author Karin Michels, an associate professor at
Harvard Medical School and clinical epidemiologist at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston. ``This is something nobody's really looked
at before. It's really new,'' she said, adding, ``It could be due to
chance.''
</P>
<P>
She speculated the French fries may be implicated in breast cancer
because they are prepared in fats that are high in harmful trans-fatty
acids and saturated fat.

The dietary survey examined the childhood eating habits of
participants in the Harvard Nurses' Health Study. To obtain
information about what adult women had eaten as preschoolers, the
researchers asked the mothers of participants in the nurses study to
fill out questionnaires asking how often their daughters had eaten 30
different food items.
</P>
<P>
The researchers analyzed data gathered in 1993 from 582
participants with breast cancer and 1,569 women without breast cancer.
The participants were born between 1921 and 1965, so their mothers
were being asked to recall information from decades earlier. Michels
noted these recollections may have been unreliable, especially when
made by mothers who already knew their daughters had breast cancer.

Consumption of whole milk was associated with a slightly decreased
risk of breast cancer, though most of the milk consumed during those
decades was whole milk, Michels said.
</P>
<P>
``Only one food so distinctly stood out as being associated with
breast cancer risk,'' Michels said, and that was the french fries.
</P>
<P>
She said dietary influences may be more significant during early
life than during adulthood, because the breast of a girl or infant is
more susceptible to environmental influences than the breast of a
mature woman.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Larry Norton, deputy physician in chief of the breast cancer
program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, warned
against over-interpreting the results. ``I wouldn't go out and change
Americans' dietary habits on the basis of this, but it's certainly
worth pursuing the hypothesis with additional research,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Michels said her study doesn't prove that giving up French fries
will protect women from breast cancer. But with child obesity rates
rising, she said, ``There are numerous reasons to avoid French
fries.''

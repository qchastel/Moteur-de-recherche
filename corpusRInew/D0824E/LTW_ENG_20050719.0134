Study Finds Higher Breast Cancer Rates in Night Shift Workers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Night shift workers who had low levels of the body's vital ``sleep
hormone,'' were significantly more likely to develop breast cancer
than those who were awake during the day but got plenty of shut-eye at
night, a team of scientists will report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The analysis by Boston researchers goes straight to the heart of a
question scientists have asked for years: Are night shift workers,
because of extended exposure to light, more likely to develop cancer?
</P>
<P>
``Two or three years ago we probably would have been reluctant to
say there was an association,'' said Dr. Eva Schernhammer, an
epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ``But now the evidence
is becoming clearer,'' that a relationship exists between tumor
development and being exposed to light at night, she said.
</P>
<P>
``This study brings us one step closer to understanding why night
shift workers may be more likely to develop breast cancer.''
</P>

During daylight or exposure to bright lights, the hormone melatonin
is suppressed. Switch off the lights, and melatonin, secreted by the
brain's pineal gland, begins to stream into the blood. The hormone
flows most copiously during sleep, thus its nickname, the sleep
hormone.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of scientists theorize that melatonin also
suppresses the growth of cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory studies by researchers at the University of Arizona have
shown that breast cancer cells stop proliferating in melatonin's
presence. And Dr. David Blask of the Bassett Research Institute in
Cooperstown found that melatonin serves as an anticancer signal to
human breast cancers.

<P>
Schernhammer, who reported her results in Wednesday's Journal of
the National Cancer Institute, said women exposed to light at night
had measurably lower levels of a melatonin breakdown product in urine.
</P>
<P>
In her analysis, which involved participants from the Nurses Health
Study, urine samples were taken from 147 nurses with invasive breast
cancer and 291 matched controls who did not have the disease.
</P>
<P>
The lowest levels of melatonin's breakdown product were in night
shift workers who had developed the cancer, leading Schernhammer to
conclude that women with the lowest levels were 70 times more likely
to develop breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
``This is an interesting bit of new information and it will be put
in context with other studies that have shown similar results and
those that have shown no association,'' said Dr. Brian O'Hea, director
of the Carol M. Baldwin Breast Care Center at Stony Brook University
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
To further test her theory about light exposure and breast cancer,
Schernhammer has embarked on a study of blind women, whose eyes aren't
transmitting light to the brain. She hypothesizes they have lower
rates of breast cancer and higher levels of circulating melatonin.

<P>
Kyrgyz police dispersed an opposition 
rally in the capital Wednesday as unrest over a parliamentary 
election dominated by pro-presidential forces simmered for a second 
week, according to an AFP reporter on the scene.

<P>
Some 300 supporters of a candidate who lost his bid for a 
parliament seat to the daughter of Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev 
gathered in central Bishkek, in the words of one, to "hold a 
peaceful meeting to defend freedom of speech and honest elections."
</P>
<P>
Police detained some of the demonstrators after dispersing the 
gathering, witnesses said. The police were not reported to have used 
excessive force.
</P>
<P>
Among those detained was the meeting's organizer, Bolot Maripov, 
who had unsuccessfully run against Akayev's daughter, Bermet 
Akayeva. Maritov is also the founder of a respected daily in the 
Kyrgyz capital, Obshchestvennoye Mneniye.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators had intended to march onto the seat of the 
government and the presidency.

<P>
Opposition supporters in Kyrgyzstan have held protests for more 
than a week since a March 13 run-off election that saw the 
opposition presence in the 75-member parliament reduced to a mere 
handful of seats.

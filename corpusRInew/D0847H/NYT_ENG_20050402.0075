BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan
</DATELINE>

<P>
Kyrgyzstan's exiled president, Askar Akayev, has agreed in
principle to step down, Kyrgyz officials said Saturday. His resignation
would pave the way for the opposition government that ousted
him more than a week ago to recover its constitutional
footing.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Kyrgyz legislators will travel to Moscow on Sunday
to negotiate final terms of the resignation, according to the
speaker of the country's new parliament, Omurbek Tekebayev.
</P>
<P>
"We have received the president's verbal agreement," Tekebayev told Agence France-Presse
on Saturday. He said that if negotiations failed, the parliament
would start impeachment proceedings. A parliament member confirmed Tekebayev's statement.
</P>
<P>
Akayev's resignation would calm Kyrgyzstan's stormy political waters and allow the
nation's focus to shift from the ouster to presidential elections
in June. Many senior Kyrgyz politicians have announced their intent
to run.
</P>
<P>
There are high hopes among Kyrgyz democracy advocates that with national
and international attention so focused on the election, the voting
could finally establish Kyrgyzstan as a truly democratic state.
</P>
<P>
Akayev fled the Kyrgyz capital on March 24 as mass protests
outside the presidential compound turned violent. Demonstrators broke through a
security cordon around the building and damaged the inside, beating
several senior officials severely.
</P>
<P>
But the leaders who quickly filled the vacuum Akayev left behind
have struggled to establish their legitimacy in the absence of
his formal resignation. They recognized the new parliament, whose election
had set off the protest movement, with the caveat that
the positions of some of the newly elected members would
be revoked because of campaign and voting abuses.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament called for new presidential elections on June 26, but
none of the government's actions have been constitutional because Akayev
remains the legal head of state until his mandate ends
in October.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Akayev has demanded that in return for his resignation he be
allowed to address the parliament and the nation. But Kyrgyzstan's
new government is reluctant to give him such a platform,
fearing it could incite new unrest.

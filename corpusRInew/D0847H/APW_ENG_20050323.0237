Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev fired the interior minister and prosecutor-general
on Wednesday, his spokesman said, as a wave of opposition protests across the
south kept up pressure on his government.
</P>
<P>
Akayev spokesman Abdil Seghizbayev said that officially, Interior Minister
Bakirdin Subanbekov and Prosecutor-General Myktybek Abdyldayev were dismissed at
their own request, but that the dismissals were linked "to the events in the
south and their poor work on preventing those events."

<P>
Seghizbayev said Akayev had named the security chief of his administration,
Murat Sutalinov, as the new chief prosecutor, and Bishkek police chief Keneshbek
Dushebayev as interior minister.
</P>
<P>
The protests began after the first round of parliamentary elections on Feb. 27
and swelled after March 13 run-offs that the opposition and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe said were seriously flawed. Protesters this
week seized control of government buildings in two of Kyrgyzstan's seven
regional capitals and a number of smaller locales.

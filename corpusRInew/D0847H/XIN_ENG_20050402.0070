Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev has 
verbally agreed to resign as president, the Interfax news agency 
quoted the Kyrgyz parliament speaker as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"A verbal agreement has been received from the president that 
he will relinquish power," said Omurbek Tekebayev, speaker of the 
newly-inaugurated parliament elected in the disputed polls in 
February and March.
</P>
<P>
Akayev has "a sober view" on the situation in the country and, 
as head of state, "he is fully aware of his actions and has acted 
in the people's interests," Tekebayev reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
A Kyrgyz parliamentary delegation headed by Tekebayev will 
leave Saturday evening for Moscow to discuss with Akayev the 
details of his resignation, the Kyrgyz parliament press service 
said.
</P>
<P>
Akayev, who fled to Russia amid opposition protests last week, 
suggested in a Russian television interview Tuesday that he might 
be willing to submit a formal resignation if his security is 
guaranteed by the new Kyrgyz parliament.
</P>
<P>
Akayev's verbal consent to step down came shortly after the 
chairwoman of the Kyrgyz Constitutional Court, Cholpon Bayekova, 
said Saturday that Akayev is ready to put his resignation in 
writing.
</P>
<P>
Akayev is expected to sign a resignation document in Moscow, 
Tekebayev said, adding that the resignation ceremony in Moscow 
will be attended by a state notary and the press.
</P>
<P>
"All privileges will be guaranteed to him according to the law"
if he resigns voluntarily, Tekebayev said.
</P>
<P>
"If he refuses to resign, it will be necessary to initiate an 
impeachment process, and in this case the president may be 
deprived of any guarantees," the speaker added.
</P>
<P>
Akayev, Kyrgyz president for the past 14 years, fled his 
country last Thursday when opposition supporters stormed the main 
government building in Bishkek.
</P>
<P>
The opposition accused the president of rigging the 
parliamentary vote to pave the way for winning a further 
presidential term later this year.

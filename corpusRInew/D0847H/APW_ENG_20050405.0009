<P>
President Askar Akayev, once hailed for creating an island of democracy in
former Soviet Central Asia, paid a heavy price for betraying the trust of his
people, who swept him from office in a popular uprising last
month.
</P>
<P>
Although he effectively ceased being Kyrgyzstan's leader after fleeing the
country ahead of demonstrators who stormed his office, Akayev's stubborn refusal
to formally resign cast a shadow over the legitimacy of the nation's new
leadership.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, he ended that uncertainty at the Kyrgyz Embassy in Moscow by signing
a resignation agreement ending his 14-year reign.
</P>
<P>
When the end finally came, popular resentment against Akayev was so high that he
chose to tape a farewell address to the nation, rather than return to give it
live.
</P>
<P>
Akayev, 60, became president of Kyrgyzstan in 1991 in the dying months of the
Soviet Union _ unusual for a former academic in a region largely run by career
Communist bureaucrats who cultivated absolute power.
</P>
<P>
An ally of reformist Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Akayev held out the
promise of democracy and for a while, Kyrgyzstan was notable in the region for
its relatively open politics. But Akayev drew international criticism for abuses
in elections and began to take a tougher line with opponents.
</P>
<P>
His image tarnished severely in 2002 when police killed six peaceful
demonstrators in southern Kyrgyzstan and the government cracked down on
opposition groups and independent media. He was criticized for failing to bring
officials responsible for the deaths to justice.
</P>
<P>
Corruption has also grown, with business leaders accusing Akayev's family of
grabbing control over profitable enterprises, and rigging deals to line their
pockets. When Akayev's son and daughter won parliamentary seats this year, fears
rose that the family was becoming all-powerful.
</P>
<P>
Opponents worried that Akayev planned to seek a referendum on allowing him to
run for another term, fears that intensified after the elections widely
criticized by the West as unfair gave him a legislature overwhelmingly dominated
by his supporters.
</P>
<P>
Akayev denied that, and blamed outside meddling for sparking protests in this
nation of 5 million that resembled earlier actions in Ukraine and Georgia, which
brought pro-Western opposition leaders to power.
</P>
<P>
Most Kyrgyz reject those criticisms, but express fears that Akayev's overthrow
won't lead to real change.
</P>
<P>
Born Nov. 10, 1944, in the northern village of Kyzyl-Bayrak, Akayev grew up in a
family of collective farmers.
</P>
<P>
He graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Fine Mechanics and Optics in 1967
with an honors degree in math, engineering and computers and later received a
doctorate from the Moscow Institute of Engineering and Physics.
</P>
<P>
He began teaching in 1977 at the Polytechnic Institute in Frunze, as the Kyrgyz
capital was then known. Some of his later Cabinet members were his former
students and friends from his academic life.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, he was elected a representative for southern Kyrgyzstan at the Soviet
Union's Supreme Council, where he was considered one of the liberal deputies and
had close ties to Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
Akayev was elected president by the Soviet Kyrgyz parliament in 1990, and was
credited with calming ethnic tensions in southern Kyrgyzstan that year after
clashes between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks killed dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
He was the only candidate in the 1991 presidential election, held less than two
months after the Kyrgyz parliament declared independence from the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
Akayev was re-elected in 1995 and 2000 in internationally criticized votes. He
rejected the criticism, saying that "Western standards (of democracy) can only
be applied to the Western world."
</P>
<P>
After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Akayev became a Washington ally by
allowing U.S.-led troops and planes to use Kyrgyzstan's main airport for combat
operations against the Taliban regime in nearby Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
But he also sought to maintain good ties with Russia. He invited the Kremlin to
set up an air base just 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the U.S. base, saying
Kyrgyzstan would be "a land for cooperation between Russia and the United
States."

<P>
Kyrgyzstan's parliament has decided to hold a special session on Thursday to
accept the resignation of exiled President Askar Akayev, which will help the
Central Asian nation leave behind its recent political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Parliament was forced to adjourn Tuesday without formally accepting the ousted
leader's resignation because lawmakers failed to muster a quorum, adding to the
confusion gripping this ex-Soviet republic since March 24 when Akayev fled to
Russia amid mass protests.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary speaker Omurbek Tekebayev agreed with lawmakers Wednesday who
called for Thursday's session to be broadcast live to this nation of 5 million
and for representatives from all of Kyrgyzstan's political branches to be
present.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five legislators present in the 75-seat Jogorku Kenesh Wednesday voted
almost unanimously to endorse the decision.
</P>
<P>
"The whole country will be witness to the discussions," Tekebayev
said.
</P>
<P>
Interim president Kurmanbek Bakiyev and the heads of the Supreme and
Constitutional Courts have also been invited to attend the event. An 18-minute
farewell address recorded by Akayev in Moscow was to be played at the
session.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyz officials pushed hard to secure Akayev's resignation, seen as a
significant step toward restoring political order and giving a stamp of
legitimacy to new leaders. A parliamentary delegation traveled to Moscow to
persuade Akayev to sign a formal resignation, which lawmakers were expected to
vote on Tuesday. But parliament fell two short of its 50-person
quorum.
</P>
<P>
Some observers blamed Tuesday's confusion to a lack of discipline and disorder
typical of a new parliament settling into its job.
</P>
<P>
Tekebayev, who led the delegation to Moscow, acknowledged Tuesday that the delay
meant Akayev continued formally to hold onto power _ albeit in
exile.
</P>
<P>
Some officials are angry that Akayev is being allowed to resign rather than face
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"He deserted the country and the people," said acting Prosecutor General Azimbek
Beknazarov. "Had he not left the country to chaos, then we could have considered
accepting his resignation."
</P>
<P>
Popular anger against what many saw as rigged parliamentary elections earlier
this year fueled the revolt against Akayev, along with persistent poverty and
widespread corruption. The parliament elected in that vote was allowed to keep
its seats despite Akayev's ouster, and it named one of the ousted president's
longtime foes, Tekebayev, as speaker.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan was the latest former Soviet republic to be upended by popular
protests. Mass protests ushered the opposition into power in Ukraine last year
and Georgia in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Akayev, 60, became leader of Kyrgyzstan in 1990, a year before it gained
independence in the collapse of the Soviet Union. His term was due to expire in
October.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have scheduled new presidential elections for June
26.

Ousted Kyrgyz President Askar 
Akayev said Sunday he has signed the document on his resignation 
in the Kyrgyz Embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"We have just finished talks with the Kyrgyz parliamentary 
delegation led by (parliament speaker) Omurbek Tekebayev. The 
talks proceeded in a constructive manner and demonstrated our full
mutual understanding," Akayev told a press conference in the 
embassy after the talks.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations resulted in a four-section document, one of 
which said, "the president of Kyrgyzstan announces his early 
resignation in compliance with his own statement," Akayev said.
</P>
<P>
The resignation ceremony will be held on Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the resignation document came after nearly three
hours of talks between Akayev and the Kyrgyz parliamentary 
delegation, which arrived here earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Akayev, who arrived in the embassy shortly after at 3 p.m. 
local time (1100 GMT), first held a one-hour talk with Tekebayev. 
The talks were then joined by other members of the Kyrgyz 
delegation.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, Akayev verbally agreed to relinquish power, a 
decision by a man described by Tekebayev as having "a sober view" 
on the situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
As head of state, "he is fully aware of his actions and has 
acted in the people's interests," Tekebayev said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Akayev, Kyrgyzstan's president for the past 14 years, was 
accused of rigging the recent parliamentary polls to pave the way 
for winning a further presidential term later this year. He fled 
his country late last month amid strong opposition protests.
</P>
<P>
Akayev fled his country on March 24 when opposition supporters 
stormed the main government building in Bishkek and has since 
hinted he wants to return and might resign if his security is 
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The president, as Kyrgyzstan's constitution stipulates, must 
address a parliament session in person to announce his resignation.
</P>
<P>
However, as Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Roza Otunbayeva has warned 
Akayev would be in danger if he returns to Kyrgyzstan, 
Constitutional Court Chairwoman Cholpon Bayekova said it would 
also be acceptable for a Kyrgyz parliamentary delegation to meet 
Akayev outside the country and bring his notarized resignation to 
Bishkek.
</P>
<P>
Tekebayev said upon arrival in Moscow, "Our mission has been 
authorized by the parliament. We've arrived here with a notary who
will document Akayev's resignation."

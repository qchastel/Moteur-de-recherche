GOP Senators Move to End Debate on Texas Justice
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republicans filed a motion Friday to end debate on
the nomination of Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen to the
federal bench, a move starting the countdown to the so-called nuclear
option.
</P>
<P>
The motion schedules for Tuesday the long-anticipated showdown over
whether Democrats have the right to use the parliamentary tactic known
as the filibuster to block President Bush's judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
Before filing the motion, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused
Democrats of exaggerating when they call the dispute a
``constitutional crisis.''
</P>
<P>
``This is a controversy, but not a crisis,'' Cornyn said. ``And I
hope that in the coming days, we will complete our debate and resolve
the controversy in a respectful manner, consistent with the greatest
traditions of the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
But the Republican push to ban the filibuster for judicial nominees
has become known as the nuclear option because of the partisan discord
it would spark in the Senate. Democrats, for instance, have threatened
to stall much of the chamber's business if the ban is adopted.
</P>
<P>
A group of a dozen senators still held out hope Friday of averting
the showdown by refusing to lend their votes to either side.
</P>
<P>
Six Republicans and six Democrats are discussing a draft agreement
under which Democrats would pledge not to use the filibuster in the
future, except under ``extraordinary circumstances.'' In return,
Republicans would pledge not to lend their votes to the effort to
change the filibuster rules, unless at some point they think the
Democrats had violated the spirit of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, five of seven Bush nominees to the federal appellate
courts would be given confirmation votes.
</P>
<P>
And the senators would call on the White House to consult with the
chamber in advance of submitting nominations, especially those to the
Supreme Court. Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has revived a proposal to
have the Senate Judiciary Committee, perhaps with the advice of an
independent commission, provide the president with a list of potential
nominees who would have bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said Friday that perhaps 80 percent
of senators, while unwilling to buck party leaders by signing onto the
compromise, nonetheless hoped it succeeds.
</P>
<P>
``This oncoming train wreck is bad for the Senate, it is bad for
the country, it is bad for the Democrats and it is bad for the
Republicans,'' he said on the Senate floor. ``We look pretty silly
lecturing Iraq on how to set up a government when we can't even decide
on having an up-or-down vote on President Bush's judicial nominees.''
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican and Democratic leaders have said they would
accept no deal that violates their fundamental principles: for
Republicans, that all judicial nominees be allowed confirmation votes
that are decided by a simple majority; for Democrats, that no changes
be made in the rules governing the filibuster.
</P>
<P>
The filibuster is the right of senators to engage in extended
debate on an issue. It takes 60 votes to end debate in the 100-seat
chamber.
</P>
<P>
The debate on Owen's nomination to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New Orleans began Wednesday. Democrats are attempting to
thwart a confirmation vote of her because they view her as an
``extremist'' conservative.
</P>
<P>
Democrats have used the filibuster threat to block 10 of Bush's
appellate court nominees during his first term. Bush renominated seven
of them, including Owen and California Supreme Court Justice Janice
Rogers Brown.
</P>
<P>
Republicans say using the filibusters on so many nominees is
unprecedented and breaks 200 years of tradition. Democrats say the
president's decision to renominate so many judges unacceptable to them
is unprecedented. They also say GOP plans to change the filibuster
rules will rend Senate traditions that protect the rights of the
minority party.
</P>
<P>
Since there are 44 Democrats and an independent who usually sides
with them in the Senate, Republicans are expected to lose Tuesday's
vote to end debate on Owen's nomination. At that point, party leaders
say they will conduct a series of maneuvers to establish a new
procedure for confirming judges.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dick Cheney is expected to preside over the session
in his capacity as president of the Senate, in case his vote is needed
to break a tie.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
First, Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., would ask Cheney for a
ruling on whether senators should have a right to vote on whether to
proceed to a confirmation vote. Cheney is expected to rule in favor of
Frist, and Democratic leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is expected to
object. Senators would then vote on whether to table, or reject, the
Democratic objection. Since Republicans are in the majority, the
objection would likely be rejected.
</P>
<P>
At that point, Frist would ask senators to vote on whether to
proceed to a final confirmation vote, which would likely pass, and
then he would ask senators to vote on Owen's confirmation. Both votes
would require a simple majority of 51.
</P>
<P>
The result of Cheney's ruling, followed by the three votes, would
be to establish a new parliamentary procedure for considering judicial
nominations that would bypass a cloture vote to end debate, thereby
making the filibuster useless as a stalling static.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the previous days, debate on the Senate floor had a
desultory air Friday, as senators saved their remaining ammunition for
the coming week. Senate aides said that debate on Monday would begin
in the afternoon and could last deep into the night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., issued an apology for remarks
on the Senate floor the previous day in which he invoked the name of
Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler in criticizing Democrats.
</P>
<P>
``Referencing Hitler was meant to dramatize the principle of an
argument, not to characterize my Democratic colleagues,'' Santorum
said, in a statement. ``It was a mistake and I meant no offense.''

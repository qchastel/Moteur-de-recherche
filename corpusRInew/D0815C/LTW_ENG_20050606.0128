Senate Opens Debate on Brown's Judicial Nomination

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
The Senate opened debate Monday on President Bush's
contentious nomination of California State Supreme Court Justice
Janice Rogers Brown to the federal bench, with Republicans praising
her as a ``great talent'' while Democrats derided her as a
conservative ideologue.
</P>
<P>
The arguments were familiar ones concerning Brown. First nominated
to the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia by Bush in
2003, she was among several presidential choices Democrats blocked
through filibuster threats during his first term. Bush renominated her
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senate leaders wanted to strip Democrats of their right
to filibuster judicial nominees until a compromise in late May among
centrists in both parties cleared the way for votes on some of the
disputed nominees, including Brown.
</P>
<P>
A vote to end debate on Brown, known as ``cloture,'' is expected
Tuesday, and Brown's confirmation vote could come as early as
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., on Monday said Brown,
the first black woman to serve on the California Supreme Court, rose
to the top of the legal profession through ``great achievement and
great talent.''
</P>
<P>
Frist noted that she was the daughter of an Alabama sharecropper.
Her father also spent much of his career in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Frist said that, ``After being delayed for two years by partisan
obstruction (Brown's nomination) will finally get an up-or-down vote,
which she deserves.''
</P>
<P>
Democrats, even as they took note of the agreement to end the
filibuster of Brown, urged senators to vote against her confirmation,
based on her legal record.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., criticized Brown for taking an
extremely limited view of government regulation in opinions that
argued for rolling back the Social Security programs or zoning
ordinances.
</P>
<P>
``It's not her life that I attack when I say I'm not for Janice
Rogers Brown. It's what she will do to your life,'' Boxer said,
referring to the public.
</P>
<P>
She added, ``Packing the courts with people like this will set our
country back.''
</P>
<P>
Brown's nomination is opposed by most black members of Congress,
all of whom are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
``Both in her court decisions and in her many writings, Ms. Brown
rejects the civil rights remedies Congress has enacted and that the
courts have approved ... and believes that parts of ... the 1964 Civil
Rights Act are unconstitutional,'' Rep. Melvin L. Watt, D-N.C.,
chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Democratic leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., accused
Bush of entangling Congress in a conflict over judicial nominations by
sending the Senate controversial nominees like Brown instead of
consensus candidates.
</P>
<P>
``This whole legislative year, we have yet to spend a single minute
debating health care, debating education, debating the environment,
debating the things that people in America feel important,'' Reid
said. ``That's too bad. These radical judges don't deserve the
attention that these other issues do.''
</P>
<P>
Republicans have responded to such criticism by accusing Democrats
of unfairly using the filibuster to thwart Bush and a GOP-controlled
Senate from filling vacancies on the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over confirming federal judges appears to have
taken a toll on the public's approval of Congress. In a Gallup poll
released Monday, just 22 percent of respondents said they have ``a
great deal'' or ``quite a lot'' of confidence in Congress -- the
lowest rating since 1997 and down from 30 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one percent of respondents said they have ``some''
confidence, and 26 percent said they have ``very little'' or ``none.''
Gallup said Congress ranks with big business and organized labor among
15 institutions tested, and only slightly better than the lowest-rated
institution, health maintenance organizations. The poll of 1,000
adults had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.

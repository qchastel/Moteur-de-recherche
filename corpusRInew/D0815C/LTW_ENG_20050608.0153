Brown Wins Senate Confirmation

<P>
An outspoken conservative California judge criticized
by Democrats as the most extreme of the president's judicial nominees
won confirmation to the nation's most important appellate court
Wednesday in a largely party-line Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
In a vote that had been blocked by a Democratic filibuster for the
past two years, the Senate approved, 56-43, the appointment of Janice
Rogers Brown to the powerful U.S. District Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
Brown became the second of three long-stalled judicial nominees who
will win Senate votes because of a deal struck by 14 moderate senators
to avert a partisan showdown over the Democrats' filibusters of the
president's judge nominees.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the long-delayed nomination of Texas state judge
Priscilla Owen to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans was
approved in the Senate under the deal.
</P>
<P>
And the Senate voted Wednesday 67-32 to end debate, and foreclose
any more filibustering, on the nomination to the 11th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta of former Alabama State's Attorney William Pryor. A
vote on him is expected Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
Majority Leader Bill Frist, whose bid to strip Democrats of their
use of the filibuster on judges was undercut by moderates, praised the
confirmation of Brown, saying, ``Principle has won a victory over
partisan judicial obstruction.''
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Republicans can claim a victory by forcing a vote and
confirming three judicial nominees adamantly opposed by Democrats and
considered by liberals to be too ideologically conservative.
</P>
<P>
``They are getting what they want,'' said Carl Tobias, a law
professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia. ``Now the
question is what do the Democrats get out of this agreement?''
</P>
<P>
Democrats have accepted the deal by the seven Republican and seven
Democratic moderates because it preserves their right to use a
filibuster against judicial nominees, though only in ``extraordinary
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
That will matter most if there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, a
possibility widely seen as likely given the serious illness of Chief
Justice William Rehnquist.

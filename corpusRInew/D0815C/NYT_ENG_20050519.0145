PARTISAN LINES DEEPEN ON DEBATE OVER JUDICIAL NOMINEES
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite behind-the-scenes efforts at compromise, partisan lines deepened in
the Senate's historic debate over judicial nominees Thursday as a
Republican who had advocated finding a middle ground lined up
behind the GOP's leadership and both parties injected racial politics
into the fight.
</P>
<P>
Another sign of the hardening of positions came late in the
afternoon Thursday when Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., chairman of the
Republican Conference, the No. 3 job in the leadership, invoked
Adolph Hitler in his criticism of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Santorum said Democrats broke Senate rules with their filibusters of judicial
nominees two years ago. Their criticism now of Republican efforts
to change the rules on debating judicial nominees is "the
equivalent of Adolph Hitler in 1942 saying, 'I'm in Paris.
How dare you invade me. How dare you bomb my
city? It's mine."'
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate response from the Democratic leadership, but the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) posted a video of Santorum's
remarks on the Internet shortly after he left the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., once a self-described "qualified supporter" of Senate
Majority Leader Bill Frist's efforts to force a vote on
the judges, announced in the second day of heated debate
that his is now an "unqualified" backer of Frist.
</P>
<P>
Still, a handful of moderates in both parties continued their talks
to find a compromise short of the so-called "nuclear option"
under consideration by Frist -- a parliamentary maneuver that would
make it easier to confirm federal judges but also profoundly
alter the way the Senate conducts its affairs.
</P>
<P>
Those talks took place in the privacy of Senate offices in
contrast to the public debate on the Senate floor that
seemed to become more heated by the hour, each side
accusing the other of political motives well beyond the sole
judicial nominee under consideration, Priscilla Owen of Texas.
</P>
<P>
But both parties used another pending nomination, that of Janice Rogers
Brown of California, an African American native of Alabama, to
reach out to blacks in the fight over Senate procedures
in addressing judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., recalled the infamous filibusters of Southern segregationists
in the 1960s who tried to block passage of major
civil rights legislation. "I would hope that today the filibuster
would not be used to deny an up-or-down vote on
Janice Rogers Brown, because every parent deserves to dream for
every child that they'll have a chance ...," he said.
</P>
<P>
Isakson's comments on the Senate floor coincided with Frist's appearance at
a news conference outside the Capitol with a group of
black ministers, including Bishop Wellington Boone of The Father's House
in Atlanta, in support of Brown's nomination to the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
Although Frist did not mention Brown's race, the Senate majority leader
said the Democratic treatment of her nomination was "uncivil" and
he vowed that he will "do everything in my power
to see that it stops."
</P>
<P>
At a separate news conference in the Hart Senate office building,
Rev. Timothy McDonald, chairman of the African American Ministers in
Action (AAMIA), disputed suggestions that racism and sexism are behind
opposition to Brown and Owen.
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, we know well that there are too few African
Americans and too few women on the courts," said McDonald,
pastor of the First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. "We
would like nothing more than to remedy this problem. But
appointing judges who will use their powerful positions to issue
rulings that hurt women and racial minorities will not solve
the problem."
</P>
<P>
Frist's appearance at the news conference followed his refusal to meet
with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, a group of
House Democrats who told Frist in a letter that a
ban on judicial filibusters "would be particularly offensive to people
of color."
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., showing support for the Congressional
Black Caucus, noted that "our nation's judges and courts have
often been the last resort for minorities seeking redress from
inadequate or unfair laws" but that could change if the
Democrats can't block "radical" judges.
</P>
<P>
Frist said the dispute was really about Senatorial responsibility.
</P>
<P>
While Democrats are entitled to oppose Owen's nomination to a seat
on the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
Frist said, "they should not hide behind a procedure that
prevents 100 United States senators from their responsibility, their duty
to vote 'yes' or 'no' on the nominee."
</P>
<P>
The Tennessee Republican was referring to the Democrats' use of unlimited
debate, or the filibuster, to stall a confirmation vote on
10 of Bush's appellate court nominees in the last Congress.
While only a simple majority of 51 is required to
confirm a judge, Senate rules require 60 votes to cut
off debate and 67 votes to change the rules.
</P>
<P>
But Frist is considering a procedure whereby the Senate's presiding officer,
Vice President Dick Cheney, will rule that it is unconstitutional
to filibuster a federal appeals court nomination, a ruling that
could be upheld by at least 51 votes, ending debate
and clearing the way for an up-or-down vote on the
nominee.
</P>
<P>
The issue of how judicial nominations will be addressed in the
Senate has taken on a new intensity with the prospect
of several Supreme Court nominations in the final three and
a half years of Bush's presidency, enough to solidify a
conservative majority on the nine-member court for a generation.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Smith was the first of several Republican senators to cite Bush's
victory in the 2004 presidential election as part of their
reason for backing Frist's attempt to remove the filibuster from
the Democrats' parliamentary arsenal before there are any battles over
Supreme Court nominees.
</P>
<P>
"Elections have consequences," Smith said. "The president has rights (to appoint
judges of his choice) ... and we have a job
to do."
</P>
<P>
But the Democrat Bush defeated in the 2004 election, Sen. John
Kerry of Massachusetts, cautioned that the attempt by the Republican
majority to change the Senate's rules in such an unusual
way represents "a dangerous time for our democracy."
</P>
<P>
Story can end here. Optional add follows.
</P>
<P>
Urging moderate Republicans to join the Democrats in opposing Frist, Kerry
said, "The Senate and the country need senators who are
prepared to make their mark on history by standing with
past profiles in courage, and defending not party, not partisanship,
but defending principle and democracy itself."
</P>
<P>
The second day of debate opened in the Senate with Sen.
Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the assistant Democratic leader, proposing that the
Senate set aside Owen's nomination temporarily to allow a vote
on four other judicial nominees awaiting a confirmation vote.
</P>
<P>
When the Republicans objected, Durbin said their actions made it "clear
that this is not about judges" but rather "a power
grab" by the president and his Republican allies in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
And when the Democrats, for the second day, invoked a rule
to limit the work of committees while the Senate is
in session, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the assistant GOP leader,
charged that the minority with "unprecedented obstructionism."
</P>
<P>
Frist announced Thursday evening that the debate would resume Friday and
that he would seek a vote to cut off the
debate on Owen's nomination next Tuesday.

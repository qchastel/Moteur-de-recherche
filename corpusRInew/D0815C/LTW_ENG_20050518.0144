Senate Opens Bitter Debate on Filibuster Ban

<P>
The Senate opened a long-awaited debate on whether to
ban filibusters of judicial nominees Wednesday with vividly partisan
attacks, as a small group of moderates worked behind the scenes for a
compromise to avert the showdown.
</P>
<P>
Senators from both parties filled the chamber all day with
impassioned speeches about their constitutional duty to give the
president ``advice and consent'' on judicial nominees. Majority Leader
Bill Frist, R-Tenn., set the tone with an opening speech that said
Democrats want to ``kill, to defeat, to assassinate these nominees.''
Democrats denounced his remarks.
</P>
<P>
Even more intense action took place in small groups and closed
meetings, as a half dozen GOP centrists, and an equal number of
Democrats, tried to close a deal that would defuse the controversy.
Aides familiar with the negotiations said they focused on two issues:
the fate of seven pending appellate court nominees who were blocked
from an up or down vote in Bush's first term, and the more difficult
issue of agreeing on how Democrats would treat the right to filibuster
judicial nominees in coming months, when a Supreme Court vacancy might
occur.
</P>
<P>
The ``six and six'' proposal, as it is called, would obligate
Democratic signatories to forswear backing a filibuster against future
judicial nominees except in extraordinary circumstances. In return,
the six GOP signers would agree to vote against efforts to ban
judicial filibusters, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
Such an arrangement would effectively end the crisis because
Democrats would not have the votes they need to prevent votes on the
nominees in question. At the same time, Frist would not have the 51
votes he needs to disallow filibusters of judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how the proposed accord would handle the seven
pending Bush nominees. Under one scenario, all would receive
confirmation votes -- and presumably be seated on various appeals
courts -- except Henry Saad of Michigan and William Myers of Idaho.
Sources said Saad had made too many Democratic enemies, in part by
accidentally sending a senator an e-mail that criticized the lawmaker.
Myers, aides said, was a lower priority to Republican conservatives
determined to secure confirmations for Priscilla Owen of Texas, Janice
Rogers Brown of California and William Pryor Jr. of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
Senators participating in the negotiations included Democrats
Joseph Lieberman, Conn.; Ben Nelson, Neb.; Mark Pryor, Ark.; Robert
Byrd, W.Va.; Mary Landrieu, La.; and Kenneth Salazar, Colo. Republican
negotiators included Olympia Snowe, Maine; John McCain, Ariz.; Mike
DeWine, Ohio; John Warner, Va.; Lindsey Graham, S.C.; and Lisa
Murkowski, Alaska. Warner hosted at least one meeting. ``It's 200
years of tradition and precedent. There are a lot of issues to
consider,'' Snowe told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The White House is taking the position that it wants no compromise
and is insisting on an up or down vote on each of its nominees.
</P>
<P>
Activist groups on the left and right have grown increasingly
intent on helping to shape the judiciary in recent years, as rulings
on abortion, school prayer and other topics have stirred deep
controversy. Stakes are especially high this year, senators say, as
many expect the first Supreme Court vacancy in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
The filibuster rarely figured in judicial fights until Bush's first
term, when Democrats used it to keep 10 appellate court nominees from
having confirmation votes. Under a filibuster, a determined minority
can keep a measure or a nomination from being approved if it can
muster 41 votes against. The Republicans want to eliminate the
filibuster for judicial nominees, making it possible to approve judges
with 51 votes -- an approach known as the ``nuclear option'' because of
the potential impact on Senate comity.
</P>
<P>
On the Senate floor Wednesday, GOP leaders charged that Democrats
have abused the filibuster by using it on several judicial
nominations, which they said was not a part of Senate traditions.
Democrats responded by saying the filibuster is a hallowed tool that
protects minority rights.
</P>
<P>
``I do not rise for party. I rise for principle,'' Frist said
moments after calling up Owen's nomination to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the 5th Circuit. When he spoke of killing nominees,
however, Democratic Whip Richard Durbin, Ill., hurried to the floor
and admonished Frist to ``choose words carefully.'' He cited the
appearance Wednesday morning before the Senate Judiciary Committee of
U.S. District Court Judge Joan Lefkow, whose husband and mother were
recently murdered.
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans are trying to convince Democrats that, even if
every pending judge were given an up-or-down vote, it isn't a foregone
conclusion all seven would be confirmed. ``Some of them wouldn't make
it,'' Graham said. If all Democrats and independent James Jeffords,
Vt., voted against a nominee, six Republicans would have to join them
-- or 11 Republicans would have to be absent -- for the nomination to
fail in the Senate, where Republicans hold 55 seats.
</P>
<P>
Other Republican senators simply want to proceed with a vote on
changing the rules on filibustering judicial nominations because, win
or lose, the matter would be put to rest. ``We need to clear it up,''
said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. Hatch, along with other conservative
GOP senators, doesn't want to compromise if it means choosing which
nominees would be approved and which rejected. ``I think there will be
an uproar on our side if we throw anybody overboard,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim) 
</P>
<P>
In a floor speech, Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Pa., traced
the politicization of the confirmation process to 1987, when Democrats
took over the Senate and the confirmation rate for Circuit Court
nominees fell to 65 percent from 89 percent earlier in the Reagan
administration. The first President Bush's lower court nominees took
an average of 100 days to confirm, twice the average duration under
the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
But when Republicans took control of the Senate during the Clinton
presidency, ``we exacerbated the pattern of delay and blocking
nominations,'' Specter said, by pushing the average duration to 192
days for district court nominees and 262 days for circuit court
nominees. Seventy of Clinton's nominees were blocked through holds or
other procedural maneuvers. Then Democrats filibustered 10 of Bush's
nominees, seven of which have been renominated.
</P>
<P>
``Against this background of bitter and angry recriminations, with
each party serially trumpeting the other party to get even or really
to dominate, the Senate now faces dual threats'' -- the filibuster and
the ``nuclear'' option, Specter said. It is a confrontation of
``mutually assured destruction,'' he added.

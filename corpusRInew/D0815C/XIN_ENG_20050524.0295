WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua)

<TEXT>
<P>
The US Senate voted Tuesday to 
end debate on one of President George W. Bush's most controversial
judicial nominees, averting a possible showdown.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 81-18 to end the filibuster over the 
nomination of Texas Supreme Court justice Priscilla Owen to a 
federal judgeship. It was expected to vote for her confirmation 
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Bush nominated Owen to a seat on the 5th US Circuit Court of 
Appeals in his first term, but the nomination has been blocked 
four times by Democratic filibusters.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came only after 14 moderate senators reached a
compromise over  Bush's stalled judicial nominees on Monday. Under
the deal, Democrats agreed to vote for cloture, or an end to 
debate, for three judicial nominees: Janice Rogers Brown, William 
Pryor and Owen.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans, for their parts, said they would oppose any 
attempt to make changes in the application of filibuster rules. 
Republicans have threatened to strip Democrats of their right to 
filibuster, or make an extended debate for delaying legislative 
action.
</P>
<P>
Democrats blocked 10 of Bush's 218 nominees in his first term 
by using filibuster. Republicans had accused Democrats of 
unprecedented obstruction, but Democrats said the nominees were 
too conservative to decide on social and cultural issues.

GOP Rejects Democrats' Compromise Plan on Filibusters

<P>
Senate Republicans on Tuesday rebuffed a Democratic
overture aimed at ending a confrontation over federal judges, saying
that any agreement must include a pledge not to filibuster future
nominees -- especially Supreme Court nominees.
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., offered to end three of
seven Democratic filibusters of President Bush's appellate court
nominees if Republicans would pledge not to change Senate rules to end
the use of the parliamentary tactic to stall votes on proposed judges.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans said they were less concerned about current
nominees than they were about future ones, especially an anticipated
Supreme Court vacancy this summer.
</P>
<P>
``Don't just focus on the past,'' Senate Majority Leader Bill
Frist, R-Tenn., said. ``All judicial and Supreme Court nominees
deserve a fair up-or-down vote.''
</P>
<P>
For their part, Democrats said they would accept no agreement that
restricted future use of the filibuster, leaving the two sides at an
impasse.
</P>
<P>
``It would be a fundamental part of any compromise that the nuclear
option be off the table,'' said Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
Neither side publicly discussed details of the Democratic offer.
However, a senior Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Reid offered to end filibusters on three of seven nominations
stalled by Democrats -- two judges from Michigan and a third judicial
nominee of Republicans' choice.
</P>
<P>
In return, the aide said, Reid asked for a Republican commitment
not to change the filibuster rules, along with promises to re-instate
Judiciary committee procedures that would permit senators to block
nominations during the committee vetting process. Reid also asked that
a bipartisan task force of retired senators be asked to make proposals
on improving the judicial confirmation process.
</P>
<P>
``I believe my proposal strikes the right balance. It protects our
democracy and the independence of our federal courts, it protects the
American people and lets us do their business, and it breaks a
partisan stalemate that is unnecessary and divisive,'' Reid said in
remarks on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
The talk of a compromise led to a Republican counteroffer proposed
on the Senate floor by the chamber's No. 2 Republican, Majority Whip
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
McConnell acknowledged that Republicans had stalled many of former
President Clinton's nominees during the committee vetting process. He
offered to change committee procedures in return for an end to
judicial filibusters.
</P>
<P>
``There's a lot of finger-pointing going on on both sides,''
McConnell said. ``This is a way to cure that.''
</P>
<P>
Democrats quickly denounced McConnell's proposal.
</P>
<P>
``There would be no filibuster. ... That's not a compromise at
all,'' said Schumer.
</P>
<P>
In the background of the debate was an anticipated Supreme Court
confirmation battle this summer. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
has cancer, raising questions about whether he will retire when the
court session ends in June.
</P>
<P>
``I think Republicans are concerned that for the first time in
history, a Supreme Court nominee might not get an up-or-down vote,''
said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. ``I think that's in the back of
everyone's mind.''
</P>
<P>
The two judges specified in Reid's offer -- Richard Griffin and
David McKeague -- are among three nominees for the 6th Circuit in
Michigan, a bench that has been the focus of partisan battles since
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
Under Reid's proposal, Republicans would have to withdraw the
nomination of a third judge, Henry Saad, who has been stiffly opposed
by Michigan's two senators, both Democrats: Sen. Debbie Stabenow and
Sen. Carl Levin.
</P>
<P>
Democrats would also allow Republicans to vote on one of four
remaining judicial nominees, all denounced by Democrats as
conservative ideologues: Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown, William
Pryor or William Myers.
</P>
<P>
After being briefed about the compromise, Levin said he was willing
to end his opposition to the two Michigan nominees if it would help
Reid solve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
``We're going to support his proposal,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with USA Today published Tuesday, White House
deputy chief of staff Karl Rove said the White House did not support a
compromise on judicial filibusters.
</P>
<P>
``We believe that every judicial nominee deserves an up or down
vote,'' Rove said. ``The process is not well served by these political
games.''
</P>
<P>
Reid denounced Rove's comments as an insistence that the Senate
become a rubber stamp for the president by providing a ``100 percent
confirmation rate.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Some polls have suggested that the American public is wary about
the Republican push on federal judges. An ABC/Washington Post survey
published Tuesday suggested that two-thirds of Americans oppose
Republican plans to change the filibuster rule and 26 percent support
it.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Republican National Committee released results of
internal polls that they said show that 81 percent of Americans
believe Democrats should not block confirmation votes for judges even
if they don't agree with them.

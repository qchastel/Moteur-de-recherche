HOW TO GO NUCLEAR, MOTION BY MOTION

<P>
If Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee decides
to exercise the "nuclear option" to end a filibuster of
President Bush's judicial nominees, here is how it is likely
to unfold, motion by motion:
</P>
<P>
---The Senate will begin debate on one of the nominees, most
likely Priscilla Owen of Texas or Janice Rogers Brown of
California.
</P>
<P>
--- At some arbitrary point in the debate, the majority leader
will seek a ruling from the presiding officer of the
Senate "regarding the appropriate length of time for debate" on
the nominee. The majority leader's point of order will maintain
that further debate on the nomination is "dilatory."
</P>
<P>
--- The presiding officer, who is likely to be Vice President
Cheney, the president of the Senate under the U.S. Constitution,
will sustain the majority leader's point of order. The presiding
officer could seek the advice of the Senate Parliamentarian before
sustaining the majority leader's point of order, but it is
not required.
</P>
<P>
---A member of the Senate, probably Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid
of Nevada, will object to the ruling of the presiding
officer as contrary to the rules and precedents of the
Senate, which currently require a vote of 60 senators to
invoke cloture, that is, bring an end to debate.
</P>
<P>
--- At this crucial point, the majority leader will offer a
nondebatable motion to table the appeal from the minority leader.
The Senate will then vote on the motion, and a
simple majority vote of the 100-member Senate will sustain the
ruling of the presiding officer. If the Senate is split
50-50 on the motion, the vice president will vote to
break the tie and sustain his own ruling.
</P>
<P>
---The Senate would then be poised to vote on the judicial
nominee.

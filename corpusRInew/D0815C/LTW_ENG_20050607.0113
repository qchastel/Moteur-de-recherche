Senate Ends Filibuster on Justice Brown

<P>
The Senate ended the filibuster of California Supreme
Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown Tuesday when 10 Democrats crossed
party lines and voted to close debate, clearing the way for a
confirmation vote Wednesday on her nomination to the second-most
powerful court in the country.
</P>
<P>
The motion to end debate, known as ``cloture,'' passed by a vote of
65-32, more than enough to clear the 60-vote threshold required.
</P>
<P>
Brown is expected to be the second long-stalled judge confirmed
after a bipartisan group of maverick and traditionalist senators cut
their own deal last month to break an impasse over confirming
President Bush's picks for the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
Bush nominated Brown to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia, the main appeals court for government-related litigation.
The court is often seen as a steppingstone to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
With a 55-seat majority in the 100-member chamber, Republicans have
enough votes to confirm Brown unless they break ranks.
</P>
<P>
During debate Tuesday, Democrats urged their Republican colleagues
to abandon the party's position and vote against Brown, whom they
repeatedly described as ``out of the mainstream.'' They accused her of
infusing her court decisions with conservative ideology and opposing
most forms of government regulation.
</P>
<P>
``I would hope that Republican senators would look at Janice Rogers
Brown for what she really is,'' Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid,
D-Nev., told reporters after the vote. ``I don't know if I've ever
known a more activist member of the judiciary, anyplace.''
</P>
<P>
Democrats had blocked a confirmation vote on Brown since November
2003 by refusing to end debate, a tactic known as the filibuster.
Seven Democrats joined with seven Republicans last month and agreed
not to continue the filibuster on Brown and several other judges,
including Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, who was
confirmed last month to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 10 Democrats who voted to end debate on Brown were
signers of the moderates' pact: Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia,
Sen. Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Sen.
Mark Pryor of Arkansas, and Sen. Ken Salazar of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
They were joined by three other centrist Democrats in voting to cut
off the debate on Brown: Sen. Thomas Carper of Delaware, Sen. Kent
Conrad of North Dakota, and Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida.
</P>
<P>
Following Brown, three more judicial nominations are on the Senate
docket for action this week: Alabama Attorney General William Pryor,
nominated for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, and
Richard Griffin and David McKeague, both of Michigan and both
nominated to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said he expected a
confirmation vote on Pryor and the two Michigan nominees on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
``The reason we're spending this whole week on judges is to
demonstrate that we have returned, now, to where we were before the
last Congress: fair up-or- down vote,'' Frist told reporters. ``And
you'll see it today; you'll see it tomorrow, you'll see it the next
day.''
</P>
<P>
The fate of two other circuit court nominees -- William Myers to
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, and Henry Saad
to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Detroit -- was not
addressed by the moderates' compromise and remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Frist said they were not on the Senate calendar for the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Before moving to Myers, `` I want to make sure the process works,''
Frist said. ``It worked with Priscilla Owen. It is working with Janice
Rogers Brown. It's going to work with William Pryor. It's going to
work with the Michigan judges. . .And then we'll just proceed down the
line in regular order.''

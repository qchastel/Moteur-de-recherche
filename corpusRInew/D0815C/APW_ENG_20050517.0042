Democratic leader says compromise efforts end, showdown looms over judge nominees

<P>
Top Senate leaders declared an unsuccessful end to their compromise talks over
President George W. Bush's stalled judicial nominees, despite fresh talk of a
deal to clear five appeals court appointees while scuttling three
others.
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to compromise and they want all or nothing, and I can't do that,"
Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada told reporters after a private meeting
Monday with Majority Leader Bill Frist.
</P>
<P>
"We both agreed that after several months of discussions, we have been unable to
come to a negotiated position where the president's nominees get an up-or-down
vote," Frist said.
</P>
<P>
By their comments, the two party leaders pushed the Senate closer to a historic
confrontation that could decide the fate of the appeals court candidates,
Supreme Court nominees during Bush's term and the Senate's venerable filibuster
rules as well.
</P>
<P>
Democrats prevented final votes on 10 of Bush's first-term appeals court
nominees, and have threatened to do the same this year to seven whom the
president renominated. Frist has threatened to change Senate procedures to strip
them of their ability to do so. At issue is the filibuster, a parliamentary
device that can be overcome only by a majority of 60 votes or higher in the
100-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
Frist and Reid reached their self-declared dead end at the same time a small
group of Democrats, who have been meeting with Republicans also eager to avoid a
showdown, floated a proposal to clear the way for confirmation of some of Bush's
blocked appointees.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, circulated in writing, Republicans would have to pledge no
change through 2006 in the Senate's rules that allow filibusters against
judicial nominees. For their part, Democrats would commit not to block votes on
Bush's Supreme Court or appeals court nominees during the same period, except in
extreme circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said Democrats involved in the
compromise would vote to end any filibuster blocking a final vote on Richard
Griffin, David McKeague and Susan Neilson, all named to the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
Democrats would also clear the way for final votes on William H. Pryor Jr. for
the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and Janice Rogers Brown for the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Both are among the nominees most
strongly opposed by organized labor as well as civil rights and abortion rights
groups and others that provide political support for the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
Three other nominations would continue to be blocked under the offer: those of
Henry Saad to the 6th Circuit Court, Priscilla Owen to the 5th Circuit and
William G. Myers III to the 9th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
Individual Democrats would be free to decide for themselves what constituted an
extreme case for future nominees, according to officials familiar with the
proposal. At the same time, Republicans would be bound to leave filibuster
practices in effect.
</P>
<P>
Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson, a Democrat seeking re-election in a Republican state,
outlined the suggested compromise for Frist on Sunday night at a dinner at the
Tennessee Republican's home. Nelson also has spoken with Reid.
</P>
<P>
Frist has said all along he will not accept any plan unless it gives each of
Bush's nominees a yes-or-no vote.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Reid has not endorsed Nelson's proposal, which would clear the way
for confirmation of one more judge than the party leader has publicly signaled
he would accept.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he met with leaders of outside groups during the day, and a
representative of one organization who attended said he did not reject the
terms, either. This individual spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Nelson's spokesman, David DiMartino, declined to confirm the details of the
compromise offer.
</P>
<P>
Republicans hold 55 seats in the Senate, meaning they can afford five defections
and still triumph. Already, though, McCain and Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode
Island have said they will break ranks. Vote counters on both sides have sad
they expect Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
Several other Republicans are publicly uncommitted, and neither side appears
certain it has enough votes to prevail if the issue is put to a vote. At the
same time, if six Republicans and six Democrats agree to a compromise of their
own, they could impose it on the leadership if necessary, averting a
showdown.
</P>
<P>
Even Republicans who strongly opposed the Democrats' repeated use of filibusters
argue that banning such moves would amount to a sweeping change in the way the
Senate conducts business. The chamber's uniqueness, they say, stems in part from
the rights it preserves for the minority.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many have expressed hope that a confrontation could be
avoided.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we are skating over very thin ice here with regard to the
continuity of life in the Senate as we've known it," Sen. Richard Lugar, an
Indiana Republican, said over the weekend on CNN. "I'm opposed to trying to
eliminate filibusters simply because I think they protect minority rights,
whether they're Republicans, Democrats or other people."

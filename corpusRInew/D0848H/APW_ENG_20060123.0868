A Turkish court dropped charges of "insulting Turkishness" Monday against
internationally acclaimed novelist Orhan Pamuk, ending a trial that outraged
even the most passionate advocates of Turkey's EU membership bid by raising
questions about the nation's commitment to freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
Coming just days before the EU is to begin a review of Turkey's much criticized
justice system, the court decision was a sign that the long-desired goal of
joining the wealthy EU was slowly forcing the government to embrace European
norms of freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The court dropped the case," Haluk Inanici, the author's lawyer, told the AP by
telephone. "This case should not have been opened in the first
place."
</P>
<P>
Olli Rehn, EU enlargement commissioner said in a statement that the decision to
dismiss charges was "good news for freedom of expression in Turkey" but warned
that Turkey "needs to fill properly the loopholes" in its penal code, which he
said limit freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
The author of critically acclaimed books including "My Name is Red," "Snow" and
"Istanbul," had faced up to three years in prison for telling a Swiss newspaper
in February: "Thirty-thousand Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these
lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it."
</P>
<P>
The remark was taken as an insult to Turkey, and a prosecutor opened a case
against the oft-mentioned candidate for the Nobel Prize under article 301 of the
new penal code, which sets penalties for insults against the Turkish Republic or
"Turkishness."
</P>
<P>
Turkey is still not off the hook, however, as dozens of people are still facing
charges similar to Pamuk's. The nationalist lawyers behind the charges have
vowed to continue prosecuting those who allegedly break the law by insulting
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Kemal Kerincsiz, a board member of the Turkish Lawyers' Union, said Monday that
he would appeal the Pamuk decision.
</P>
<P>
"It is a scandal," Kerincsiz said by telephone. "Orhan Pamuk must be punished
for insulting Turkey and Turkishness, it is a grave crime and it should not be
left unpunished."
</P>
<P>
European officials have repeatedly asked that Turkey change its laws to take the
legal ammunition away from those who would prosecute speech offenses in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Pamuk is not the only case of a person prosecuted for having expressed a
non-violent opinion in Turkey, it's just the most high-profile case," Rehn
said.
</P>
<P>
Writers' advocacy group International PEN welcomed the dropping of charges but
said it was not nearly enough. "It does little to assuage PEN's concerns that
the right to freedom of expression in Turkey is severely curtailed by the
existence of laws that penalize debate on "taboo" topics," PEN said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
For Europeans who oppose Turkey's membership in their club of democracies, the
prosecution of Pamuk reinforced the view that the nation of 70 million Muslims,
while a useful buffer between Europe and the Middle East, is no part of
contemporary European civilization.
</P>
<P>
The case also divided Turkey and embarrassed the nation's liberals.
</P>
<P>
"Article 301 and others curbing freedom of expression which do not fit Turkey's
democratic image must be changed," said Inanici.
</P>
<P>
The country's press organizations have accused the government of lacking the
political will to change laws hindering free expression. But Justice Minister
Cemil Cicek on Friday admitted shortcomings in Turkey's judicial system and
promised more legal reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is a state of law. There are shortcomings, and we're unified in
eliminating them," on the road to the EU, Cicek said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul acknowledged that charges
brought against Pamuk had tarnished the country's image and said for the first
time that laws that limit freedom of expression may be changed.
</P>
<P>
In the opening hearing of the trial Dec. 16, a judge threw the case back to the
Justice Ministry, demanding that the government first approve it. Then last
week, Cicek sent the case back to the local court, saying the ministry has no
say under a new penal code.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Istanbul court said: "It was necessary to decide to drop the case
because there was no explicit authorization for prosecution."
</P>
<P>
Cicek's move was an apparent attempt to avoid upsetting both the EU and Turkish
nationalists. But Monday's court decision will likely anger nationalists,
including some within the government's conservative grass roots.
</P>
<P>
During the trial nationalists pelted Pamuk's car with eggs, shouting "Traitor!"
and "Love it or leave it!" in reference to Turkey.

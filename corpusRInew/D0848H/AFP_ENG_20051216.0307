Prominent Turkish author Orhan Pamuk 
said he regretted being unable to defend himself Friday in his trial 
for insulting the Turkish nation, which he said would stain Turkey's 
image.
</P>
<P>
"I am sorry that I could not make (my) defense," the 53-year-old 
said in a written statement released by his publisher after the 
trial was suspended until February 7 immediately after the start of 
the first hearing.
</P>
<P>
"It is not good for Turkey or for our democracy for trials 
concerning freedom of thought -- which should never happen in the 
first place -- to be lengthy affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The court hearing the trial suspended the case pending 
authorisation from the justice ministry, which it says is essential 
for it to proceed.
</P>
<P>
The ruling came despite opposition from Pamuk's lawyer, Haluk 
Inanici, who asked the court to either proceed and hear his client's 
testimony, or drop the case altogether.
</P>
<P>
"My client's right to a fair trial was and continues to be 
violated... from the day the prosecution launched its investigation 
until today," Inanici said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk risks a jail term of six months to three years for 
"denigrating the Turkish national identity" for remarks published in 
a Swiss magazine in February concerning the Armenian massacres 
during World War One.

<P>
The European Union said on Thursday that the trial of a leading Turkish novelist
accused of insulting his country was a litmus test for Turkey's commitment to
freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
The trial of Orhan Pamuk starting Friday will also question whether Turkey is
seriously committed to recent reforms it has made under EU pressure, such as
guaranteeing freedom of expression, said EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli
Rehn.
</P>
<P>
"The trial of a novelist who expressed a nonviolent opinion casts a shadow over
the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity to set a positive precedent for the numerous other cases
on free speech that are awaiting trial," he said. "It is not Orhan Pamuk who
will stand trial tomorrow, but Turkey."
</P>
<P>
The 25-nation bloc officially started entry negotiations with Ankara in October
and insists Turkey meet EU standards on human rights before it can
join.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk, whose books have been translated into more than 20 languages, faces up to
three years in prison for telling a Swiss newspaper in February that 30,000
Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed under Turkish rule in the early 20th
century. He denies that he used the word "genocide."
</P>
<P>
Turkey denies that the mass killings were genocide, saying the death toll is
inflated and Armenians were killed in civil unrest as the Ottoman Empire
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Rehn said the number of recent prosecutions cast doubt on Turkey's new penal
code, saying it may not provide sufficient protection for the freedom of
expression _ one of the standards the EU has set for future members.
</P>
<P>
"The commission expects that the Turkish government will make it clear to the
country's prosecutors and judges that ... the new penal code should be
interpreted fully in line with the European Convention of Human Rights," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The EU also expected the government to close the legal loopholes that allowed
such restrictive interpretations on freedom of expression, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Duff, a British lawmaker in the European Parliament, said Pamuk was "a
beacon of liberal hope" in a society still torn between the ancient and the
modern.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government "must eliminate all archaic laws in Turkey that have been
designed in a former period to protect the state against the citizen and to
suppress freedom of thought or expression," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has also called on Turkey to drop the case, which will be
heard in an Istanbul district court.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk's books include the internationally acclaimed "Snow" and "My Name is Red."
He has received numerous international awards.

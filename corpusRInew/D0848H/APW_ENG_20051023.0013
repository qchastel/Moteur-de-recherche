<P>
Outspoken Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk has said he stands by his controversial
remarks about the killing of Armenians and Kurds, for which he could face
imprisonment in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk, who is to go on trial in Turkey on Dec. 16 on charges of insulting his
country's national character, is this year's recipient of the German Book
Trade's annual Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
"I repeat, I said loud and clear that 1 million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were
killed in Turkey," he told reporters Saturday at the Frankfurt Book Fair. "And I
stand by that."
</P>
<P>
However, he reiterated that he had not used the term genocide in reference to
the killings.
</P>
<P>
"Whether it should be called genocide or mass murder or something else, must be
decided upon by experts," the 53-year-old writer said.
</P>
<P>
Controversy has surrounded Pamuk since he told a Swiss newspaper in February
that "30,000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody
but me dares to talk about it."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Kurds killed over the past two decades during Turkey's
conflict with autonomy seeking Kurdish guerrillas, branded as a terrorist group
by the U.S. and European Union, and to Armenians killed around the time of World
War I. Armenians and several country's recognize those killings as the first
genocide of the 20th century, which Turkey vehemently denies.
</P>
<P>
Turkish prosecutors filed charges against Pamuk and he goes to court on Dec. 16.
If convicted, he could be sentenced to as long as three years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European Union have called on Turkey to drop the
charges to ensure freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Frankfurt Book Fair said they awarded the prize to Pamuk in
honor of his advocating freedom of speech and promoting understanding through
his literature.
</P>
<P>
"The award for Orhan Pamuk honors a writer who, unlike any other author of our
time, pursues the historic traces of the West in the East and the East in the
West, dedicated to a concept of culture that is based entirely on knowledge of
and respect for the person who is different," the organizers said. He will
formally receive the prize on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk, who has written several notable works, including "Sessiz Ev," "The White
Castle," "My Name is Red" and "Snow," said he welcomed the prize, which includes
euro25,000 (US$30,000). He is the second Turk to receive the prize, after Yasar
Kemal who was awarded the same prize in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said several European writers had influenced his work.
</P>
<P>
"Dostoyevsky, Thomas Mann, Tolstoy, Proust, Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Faulkner ..
they all had a great influence on me, and when I write I speak with them," he
said. "European writers have helped their countries develop and I count myself
among them."
</P>
<P>
The novelist said he hoped Turkey would eventually join the 25-nation EU, noting
it would provide his country with the means to improve.
</P>
<P>
"The criterion for admission _ for instance the equal treatment of minorities _
would be favorable for Turkey," he said, adding that the EU would also benefit
from expanding its borders.

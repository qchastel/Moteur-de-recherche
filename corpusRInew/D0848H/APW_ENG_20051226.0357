A group of Turkish writers, academics, journalists and artists called on the
government Monday to scrap laws that limit freedom of expression, including one
under which the country's most famous novelist has been charged.
</P>
<P>
EU officials have harshly criticized such laws and a group of 169 intellectuals
issued a statement, saying they viewed Orhan Pamuk's trial as "a grave
interference in our country's democratization process."
</P>
<P>
The group, which includes novelist Yasar Kemal and pianist Fazil Say, said the
government should do away with the law that makes it a crime to insult the
Turkish republic, "Turkishness" or state institutions, which was used against
Pamuk.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk was charged with insulting the country after telling a Swiss newspaper in
February that "30,000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands,
and nobody but me dares to talk about it."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a group of observers from the European Parliament attending
Pamuk's trial demanded that Turkey change the article used against Pamuk or risk
putting its EU bid in jeopardy. The next hearing is scheduled for Feb.
7.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk's remarks highlighted two of the most painful episodes in Turkish history:
the massacre of Armenians during World War I _ which Turkey insists was not a
planned genocide _ and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey's overwhelmingly
Kurdish southeast.

<P>
The Istanbul court trying prominent 
Turkish author Orhan Pamuk on charges of insulting the Turkish 
nation on Friday suspended the trial until February 7 pending 
authorisation to proceed from the justice ministry.
</P>
<P>
The court had ruled on December 2 that since the alleged offence 
was committed before Turkey amended its penal code earlier this 
year, Pamuk should be judged under the old law, which requires a 
direct order from the justice ministry for the trial to proceed.
</P>
<P>
With Justice Minister Cemil Cicek saying in remarks published 
Friday that he still had not received the prosecution file, the 
court was froced to suspend the trial until the ministry reaches a 
decision on whether to try Pamuk or not.

<P>
A Turkish court convened here Friday to 
try prominent Turkish author Orhan Pamuk on charges of insulting the 
Turkish nation, but it was not immediately clear whether the trial 
would proceed.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers from the European parliament and leading Turkish 
intellectuals were present for the trial in which Pamuk, 53, risks 
six months to three years in jail.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old author, wearing a dark business suit and tie, 
made his way into the cramped courtroom amid a crowd of reporters, 
supporters and protestors.
</P>
<P>
The court, in a ruling dated December 2, said that since the 
alleged offence was committed before Turkey amended its penal code 
earlier this year, Pamuk should be judged under the old law, which 
requires a direct order from the justice ministry for the trial to 
proceed.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Cemil Cicek in remarks published Friday said he 
had not received the prosecution file by Thursday afternoon, making 
it unlikely the trial would begin Friday.

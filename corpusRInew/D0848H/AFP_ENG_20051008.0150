<P>
EU enlargement commissioner Ollie Rehn 
lent support Saturday to prominent Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk, who 
faces trial in December over controversial remarks about the 
Armenian massacres and could end up serving three years in jail.
</P>
<P>
Rehn, who has just wound up an official visit to Turkey linked 
to its ambitions to join the European Union, called on Pamuk, the 
widely translated author of such internationally renowned works as 
"The White Castle", and "Snow", in his Istanbul apartment.
</P>
<P>
"I was glad to meet with my friend Orhan Pamuk," Rehn said 
afterwards. "We discussed about Turkish literature, history and 
society."
</P>
<P>
Both men said they had not talked about Pamuk's forthcoming 
trial, but Rehn stressed, "Freedom of expression is a core European 
value. Any country who wants to enter the EU has to share this 
value."
</P>
<P>
Pamuk for his part said they had discussed "literature, 
children, life" but also "democracy, human rights, freedom of 
thought."
</P>
<P>
The author praised the start of Turkey's negotiations for 
entering the EU, calling it "eminently positive."
</P>
<P>
Rehn aide Jean-Christophe Filori stressed to AFP that the visit 
was during the "private part" of the EU commissioner's stay in 
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Pamuk triggered a public outcry when he said in an interview 
with a Swiss newspaper in February that "one million Armenians were 
killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it."
</P>
<P>
As a result, Pamuk, who is to receive the prestigious peace 
prize of the Association of German Publishers and Booksellers on 
October 23, received several death threats and an official ordered 
the seizure and destruction of his works.
</P>
<P>
A prosecutor in Istanbul indicted 53-year-old Pamuk on the 
grounds that his remarks amounted to "public denigration of the 
Turkish identity" and has demanded a prison term of between six 
months and three years, according to the author's publishers 
Iletisim.
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to start on December 16, it added.
</P>
<P>
The massacre of Armenians during World War I is one of the most 
controversial episodes in Turkish history.
</P>
<P>
Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kinsmen died in 
orchestrated killings nine decades ago during the last years of the 
Ottoman Empire, the precursor of modern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey argues that 300,000 Armenians and thousands of Turks were 
killed in what was civil strife during World War I when the 
Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers.

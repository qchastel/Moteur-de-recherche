Experts Warn of Electromagnetic Bomb Danger

<P>
Security experts warned Tuesday that terrorists could
unleash electromagnetic bombs to cripple the nation, damaging
electrical systems vital to everything from financial services to
transportation and communications.
</P>
<P>
They urged Congress and Homeland Security officials to craft plans
to fend off such attacks and set up mechanisms to fix and restore
power quickly.
</P>
<P>
``Their effects on systems and infrastructures dependent on
electricity and electronics could be sufficiently ruinous as to
qualify as catastrophic to the nation,'' said Lowell Wood, acting
chairman of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States
from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack, an advisory group set up by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the United States is particularly vulnerable because it
relies heavily on telecommunications and electronics.
</P>
<P>
In some scenarios, the e-bomb could be used to release an
electromagnetic pulse that could disable and damage electrical power
systems.
</P>
<P>
An e-bomb attack could ``devastate this country,'' said Sen. Jon
Kyl, R-Ariz., chairman, of the Judiciary subcommittee on terrorism,
technology and homeland security, which conducted a hearing Tuesday on
the potential threat. ``The public and the Congress need to pay more
attention to this danger.''
</P>
<P>
Wood cautioned that potential adversaries, including terrorists,
have or can get nuclear weapons to generate the electromagnetic pulse.
</P>
<P>
Those threats come not only from terrorists but from nations with
nuclear capabilities such as North Korea and Iran, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
While not a new threat (it was also a major concern during the Cold
War), lawmakers and commissioners said that since the Sept. 11, 2001
terrorist attacks, the threat has heightened. The commission released
a report this past July.
</P>
<P>
Much of that report still has not been made public because of
security concerns, commissioners said. Some of its recommendations
include the government buying backup transformers to be stored in
protected shelters and crafting a plan to use diesel electric motors.
</P>
<P>
They point to the 2003 blackout as an example of the devastating
impact of losing power.
</P>
<P>
Peter Fonash, acting deputy manager for the National Communications
System, Department of Homeland Security, acknowledged the potential
threat.
</P>
<P>
But he said the agency has conducted tests and simulations,
particularly on telecommunications switches, and have ``determined
that there is minimal EMP effect.''
</P>
<P>
But Peter Vincent Pry, a staffer on the commission, argued that the
nation's telecommunications systems are vulnerable and he said that
other countries have taken steps to protect against e-bomb attacks
``indicating that this threat has broad international credibility.''

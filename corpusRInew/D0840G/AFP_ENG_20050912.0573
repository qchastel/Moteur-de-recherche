A huge power cut hit much of Los 
Angeles on Monday and emergency services were put on an immediate 
alert.

The authorities were investigating the cause of the blackout, 
which hit a swathe of the sprawling city from North Hollywood, 
through Burbank and downtown, to southern Los Angeles.

The outage affected power to the Los Angeles police department 
headquarters but the fire department said it had not suffered a 
major impact.

Police and fire services were put on "tactical alert", spokesmen 
told US media.

problems".

California imposed rolling power cuts in 2001 because of a 
failed deregulation scheme, the effect of a drought and several 
other circumstances that put strains on the power grid.

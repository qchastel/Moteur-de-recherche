NRG Energy Inc. agreed Sunday to buy privately held power generator Texas Genco
LLC for $5.8 billion (euro4.82 billion), in a deal that furthers consolidation
in the electricity generation industry.
</P>
<P>
NRG will pay $4 billion (euro3.32 billion) in cash and $1.8 billion (euro1.49
billion) in common and preferred stock, and will also assume $2.5 billion
(euro2.08 billion) in Texas Genco debt. The deal comes four months after Duke
Energy Corp. agreed to acquire rival Cinergy Corp. in a stock deal worth nearly
$9 billion (euro7.47 billion).
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the two companies said the combination will create a premier
wholesale power generation company with broad geographic reach.
</P>
<P>
Once the deal is completed, the combined company will have a domestic generating
capacity of almost 24,000 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
"Texas Genco is an ideal strategic fit with NRG," David Crane, NRG's president
and CEO said in a statement. "The strengths of its people and its assets align
closely with our own, bolstering NRG's platform for growth and our ability to
drive value for our shareholders."
</P>
<P>
West Windsor, New Jersey-based NRG owns and operates power-generating facilities
in the Northeast, South Central and West Coast regions of the United States. The
company also has ownership interests in power generating facilities in
Australia, Germany and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Altogether the company has about 15,000 megawatts of power-producing capacity,
about 2,000 megawatts internationally and the majority in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
NRG, founded as a unit of Xcel Energy Inc. in 1989, built or acquired more than
50 power plants in the United States, Europe, Asia and South America. But the
company, which had borrowed heavily to make the acquisitions, couldn't pay its
debt when the energy prices collapsed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The company filed for bankruptcy protection, enabling it to eliminate about $6
billion (euro4.98 billion) in debt and restructure. NRG emerged from bankruptcy
protection in December 2003. The company moved its corporate headquarters in
January from Minneapolis to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
NRG said in a statement that it expects the combined NRG and Texas Genco will
increase NRG'S earnings and cash flow per share, giving the company greater
financial strength and allowing it to pursue other growth opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Texas Genco, is the second-largest power generation company in the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas, a power grid which includes most of the state, and
is capable of producing roughly 11,000 megawatts of power.
</P>
<P>
Texas Genco used to be a majority-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, which
provides electrical service to the Houston area. Nineteen percent of the company
was traded publicly when CenterPoint owned it.
</P>
<P>
A private equity consortium of The Blackstone Group, Hellman  Friedman LLC,
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co. LP and Texas Pacific Group owns Texas Genco.
Texas deregulated its energy market in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Texas Genco owns fully or in part 10 power plants. It has a 44 percent stake in
the South Texas Project nuclear plant, which provides power to more than 1
million homes in South Texas. Most of the companies power plants are located in
and around Houston and in southeast Texas.

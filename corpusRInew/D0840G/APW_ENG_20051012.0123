A blackout hit downtown government buildings, Chinatown and adjacent areas, but
backup power kept key parts of City Hall and police headquarters running. It was
the third significant electrical failure in the city since mid-September.
</P>
<P>
The blackout began about 9 a.m. and cut power to as many as 1,000 customers,
affecting City Hall, the Los Angeles County Hall of Administration and police
headquarters at Parker Center, said Gale Harris, a spokeswoman for the city
Department of Water and Power, which provides electricity to 1.4 million
customers.

<P>
Power was restored shortly before 6 p.m. The cause of the outage remained under
investigation, although officials ruled out terrorism or human error, said Carol
Tucker, another DWP spokeswoman. She said brief power outages were likely
through the night, as engineers planned to test the system.
</P>
<P>
"Outages just happen periodically, but we do seem to be having an inordinate
number," Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
About 100 downtown commercial customers were still without power at
midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
Backup power kicked in at police headquarters, though parts of the complex were
dark until electricity was fully restored there before noon, Harris said. A City
Council meeting was in progress when the lights went out, but the meeting
continued as City Hall switched to backup power.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the blackout, traffic signals that had gone dark snarled
traffic through parts of Chinatown and in sections of downtown.
</P>
<P>
Power failures affected 2 million people Sept. 12, while 40,000 customers in
downtown and neighborhoods to the east lost service Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
The first outage lasted 1 1/2 hours after a utility crew cut several control
lines in the San Fernando Valley. A subsequent report by the DWP cited faulty
work plans, a failure to double-check the designs and miscommunication.
</P>
<P>
The second power failure involved a substation where a bank of transformers that
had been shut down for maintenance was brought back online. That accidentally
triggered other banks of transformers to go off-line. Power was restored in
about five minutes and the cause was under investigation.

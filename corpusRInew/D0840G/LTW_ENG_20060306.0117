Mixed Reviews for British Power Company

Retiree Claire L. McGrath no longer immediately
opens her utility bills from National Grid because she said it's too
upsetting to see the skyrocketing cost of heating and lighting her
two-family home in this city. She just peeks at the amount, and then
later in the month expresses her anger at the power company by making
out her check to ``National Greed.''
</P>
<P>
Bill Driscoll, a construction worker, also said he pays too much
for electricity and natural gas. But he appreciated utility crews'
quick response to a power outage caused by a windstorm last month.
``We have hard winters here, and when we lose power, the linemen bust
their butts to restore it. That costs money,'' said Driscoll, 36, of
Pennellville.
</P>
<P>
With natural-gas prices spiking in the past six months because of
increased demand, National Grid has become the target of barbs from
customers and area politicians, some of whom are calling for Syracuse
to generate its own electricity. Still, others remain leery of the
British company that four years ago took over Niagara Mohawk Power
Corp., which had deep roots here and provided energy for much of
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
Last month, National Grid announced plans for a $7.3-billion
takeover of KeySpan Corp., the company that supplies electricity and
gas to customers of the Long Island Power Authority. If regulators
approve the deal, National Grid will be primarily an energy producer
for residents of Nassau and Suffolk counties; LIPA will continue to
own the poles and wires, and make service calls. That differs from
upstate, where National Grid delivers power generated by others.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of this key difference, McGrath advised Long Island
residents to be skeptical of National Grid based on her recent
experiences. ``I don't believe them when they say it's not their fault
that my bill is out of whack,'' said the 80-year-old neighborhood
activist, who estimated her monthly bill has increased by more than
$100 since 2001. In the past three months, her bills have ranged from
$220 to $375. ``A lot of people are suffering and National Greed
doesn't seem to care.''
</P>
<P>
National Grid officials acknowledged the difficulty that some
homeowners and businesses are having in paying much higher bills since
last fall. But the utility, they said, has no control over prices for
gas or electricity, which also have risen because many
electric-generating plants use gas.
</P>
<P>
``We go out and buy the commodity, and whatever it costs, we pass
along to the customer in conjunction with the bill that they get for
delivery,'' said William F. Edwards, the company's president of New
York distribution. ``We are stuck in the middle (between ratepayers
and energy producers) ... But we try to do the best that we can to
make payment arrangements with customers, to help them figure out how
to use less product to make the bill lower.''
</P>
<P>
Edwards added that National Grid has contained the costs it
controls -- delivery charges for gas have only gone down since the
mid-1990s and those for electricity fell by 8 percent after the
takeover of Niagara Mohawk in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Despite some complaints about rude customer service agents and
frequent power outages from a dozen ratepayers interviewed at the
Carousel Center mall earlier this week, National Grid has improved its
performance. The number of complaints fell to 2,492 last year compared
with 3,718 in 2003, according to figures from the state Public Service
Commission, which regulates utilities. National Grid has 1.5 million
electric customers and 560,000 gas customers stretching from Buffalo
in the west, Watertown in the north and Albany in the east.
</P>
<P>
In Syracuse, several manufacturers and business groups said the
transition from Niagara Mohawk to National Grid had been seamless. The
name changed, but not the personnel.
</P>
<P>
Niagara Mohawk has been a fixture in Syracuse for generations,
cobbled together from smaller utilities in 1929 by financier J.P.
Morgan and others. The company's headquarters, along a now filled-in
stretch of the Erie Canal, is an Art Deco gem whose ``Spirit of
Light'' sculpture was meant to woo Depression-era ratepayers on the
benefits of electricity.

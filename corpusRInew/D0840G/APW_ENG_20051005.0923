Venture capitalists warming to investing in energy

With oil prices surging and increased talk of global warming, venture
capitalists are straying from their traditional focus on computer technology and
biotechnology to put increasing sums into alternative-energy
companies.
</P>
<P>
Venture activity is way up in the past six months, with more energy companies
presenting business plans to investors and more high-priced deals being done.
Over the summer, four solar-energy companies attracted a stunning $60 million
(euro50 million) in a round of high-priced financings that generated the first
whispers an investment bubble may be forming.
</P>
<P>
For venture capitalists, "it's a very nascent market," says Warren Weiss,
general partner at Foundation Capital. "It almost reminds you of looking at the
Internet market 10 years before (browser pioneer) Netscape" unleashed the
dot-com gold rush, he says.
</P>
<P>
Weiss says that in the past 18 months his firm has made three energy investments
in an attempt to identify where advances in technology _ cheap, powerful chips,
more capable software and broadband communications _ will have an impact on the
energy business.
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't do it 10 years ago," he says. "We think the market is
ready."
</P>
<P>
Weiss is not the only one to decide the time is right. Many white-shoe venture
firms have named energy specialists and written funding checks, including
Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers and Mohr Davidow Ventures, which became one
of the year's more active firms with its first three investments.
</P>
<P>
"We see a great market opportunity," says Erik Straser, general partner at Mohr
Davidow, who studied the business for almost three years before getting
involved. "There's lots of innovation."
</P>
<P>
Two of the firm's startups _ Energy Innovations Inc. of Pasadena, Calif., and
Nonosolar Inc. of Palo Alto _ make solar cells while the third, Jadoo Power
Systems Inc. of Folsom, California, makes fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, venture investments in alternative-energy
companies jumped this year, although they remain a small slice of the overall
business. Venture capitalists put $139.5 million (euro117 million) into solar,
wind and geothermal energy companies through the second quarter of the year,
already surpassing the $95 million (euro79.5 million) they spent in all of 2004,
according to the National Venture Capital Association, Thomson Financial and
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
Other groups monitoring the market see a similar rise in spending, if not as
steep. Nth Power, a venture firm focused on energy, calculates venture firms and
venture arms of corporations put $690 million (euro577.5 million) in emerging
technology companies in 2004 and already close to $533 million (euro446 million)
through September of this year. The numbers are higher because Nth Power
includes investments not only energy producers but technology companies _ such
as software firms _ that make products for the energy business.
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt we are seeing quite a bit more activity," says Tim Woodward,
managing director at Nth Power.
</P>
<P>
Cleantech Venture Network LLC also is seeing more funding take place. The
research organization says $189.4 million (euro158.5 million) went into
energy-related venture deals in the second quarter, up 42 percent from the first
quarter. The company also uses a broad definition of an energy company that
includes startups making energy-generating equipment, as well as batteries and
products to improve energy efficiency, such as low-power lighting.
</P>
<P>
More money is on the way. Between 80 and 100 funds are out raising new money to
invest in "cleantech," a term that includes energy companies and environmental
businesses with transportation, water-purification and air-improvement projects,
says Nicholas Parker, chairman of Cleantech.
</P>
<P>
The recent surge in energy investing isn't hard to understand. With oil prices
around $65 a barrel, alternative-energy sources become more competitive,
especially with subsidies in many countries and new subsidies in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Venture capitalists also see opportunities in the fragile power-transmission
grid. "The first shock to the system was the Northeast blackout" of 2003, says
Woodward. Yet, even as the health of the Earth may be under assault from global
warming, the potential demand for power remains enormous.
</P>
<P>
Venture capitalists say there are good and bad sides to the surge in energy
investing. On one hand, "it's easier to put together investment syndicates than
it used to be," says Peter Edwards, a partner at Altira Group LLC, an energy VC.
On the other, "I would say there is more competition," he says.
</P>
<P>
So far, the valuations being paid in energy deals remain reasonable. But prices
are creeping higher, and some VCs say the danger of a bubble is real. Nanosolar,
Miasole of San Jose, California, Energy Innovations and HelioVolt Corp. of
Austin, Texas, closed on a total of $60 million (euro50 million) in a few short
weeks, leading some to suggest the category is overheated.
</P>
<P>
"I think the (solar) market will absolutely continue to grow," says Woodward.
But "not every one of those companies will succeed."

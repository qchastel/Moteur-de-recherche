<P>
On a day when oil and gasoline prices
hit record highs, President Bush on Monday signed into law
a bill that encourages increased domestic oil and gas production
and the building of new nuclear power plants while creating
incentives for alternative energy sources and requiring modernization of the
nation's electrical grid.

<P>
At a ceremony at the Sandia National Laboratory here, Bush acknowledged
that the measure would not immediately bring down the price
of gasoline, but he said it would give the United
States a start on reducing its dependence on foreign oil
and help the economy over the long run.
</P>
<P>
The measure has been one of the White House's legislative priorities
since 2001. The final product did not contain a number
of provisions backed by the administration, including one that would
have opened a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
to oil drilling.

<P>
It won support from some Democrats in Congress, but it was
criticized by many others and also by environmental and consumer
groups, who said it gave away too much to energy
companies at a time when they were benefiting from high
oil prices, which neared $64 a barrel on Monday. The
Energy Department reported Monday that the average national price for
a gallon of unleaded gasoline hit $2.37 last week, a
record and 49 cents a gallon above prices a year
ago.

<P>
The bill he signed here touches on many aspects of energy
policy. In addition to encouraging more domestic oil and gas
production, it provides money for research into technology to help
burn coal with less pollution and creates federal risk insurance
for companies that build a new generation of nuclear power
plants.
</P>
<P>
It extends or creates tax incentives for alternative energy sources like
wind, creates incentives for the use of more ethanol and
finances research into the use of hydrogen to power automobiles.
The bill contains incentives for oil companies to expand refineries
to reduce periodic tightness in supplies of gasoline, and tax
credits for conservation and energy efficiency.

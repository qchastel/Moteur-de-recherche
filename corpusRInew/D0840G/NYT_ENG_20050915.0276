EXPERTS ASSESS DEREGULATION AS FACTOR IN '03 BLACKOUT

Twenty-five months after a blackout darkened cities from New
York to Toronto and Detroit, the U.S. Energy Department and
its Canadian counterpart held their first public technical discussion on
the episode Thursday to talk about one factor widely considered
to have been behind it: the deregulation of the electric
system.
</P>
<P>
Engineers, government officials and executives said at the meeting that amid
its restructuring the industry needed further changes, to reduce the
frequency of blackouts as utilities that formerly generated power, transmitted
it and delivered it are broken up into separate entities
of competing businesses.
</P>
<P>
"The most serious mistake we can make is pretending that markets
do things that they do not do," said Kellan Fluckiger,
executive director of the electricity division at the Alberta Department
of Energy. "Markets allocate risk, they allocate capital, they provide
price signals. Markets do not have a conscience, they do
not provide social policy, and they do not do things
they are not paid to do."
</P>
<P>
For example, participants at the meeting said, utilities that once ran
the system sometimes added transmission lines to increase reliability of
electric power. When they did so, their costs would be
reimbursed through the regulatory process; now there is less incentive
to take on such efforts, and several participants pointed out
that in fact investment in transmission had lagged.
</P>
<P>
The blackout of 2003 began on Aug. 14 and in some
places lasted more than two days. A binational report issued
three months afterward did not list deregulation as a cause,
instead citing factors like failure to trim trees, train operators
and install control systems that could have kept track of
the status of all power lines and generators.
</P>
<P>
Much of the investigation leading to that report was managed by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the architect of utility restructuring
in the United States. The report called for a separate
study -- it did not say by whom -- on
the role of deregulation in the blackout, but that study
has never been done.
</P>
<P>
Experts at Thursday's meeting said the changes in the industry had
had several adverse effects, including a loss of experience among
personnel. One member of the panel, Jack Casazza, a 60-year
veteran of the industry, said the changes had brought lawyers
and MBA's to the head of these competitive companies, rather
than engineers.
</P>
<P>
"They may be decent people, fine bankers, fine lawyers, wonderful golfers,"
Casazza said, "but they don't have the background."
</P>
<P>
He also said that while the old utilities had often maintained
large reserve margins of electricity, to minimize the chance of
shortages, some market participants now preferred lower margins, to drive
up prices.
</P>
<P>
Others pointed out that information like a power plant's maximum capacity,
and its state of repair on any given day, was
now considered proprietary and so was not readily available to
system operators, which manage regional power grids.
</P>
<P>
The North American Electric Reliability Council, whose members come from utilities,
marketers, customers and federal agencies, said in a paper submitted
for the meeting that the increased demands that deregulation's wider
trading had placed on the transmission system "require the grid
to be operated closer to its reliability limits more of
the time than was the case in the past."
</P>
<P>
That requires better training and control equipment, said the group, which
was founded after a vast blackout in the Northeast in
1965.
</P>
<P>
Still, not all the industry's changes have affected reliability adversely, participants
said. In a paper written for the meeting, Dave Goulding,
chief executive of the Ontario Independent Electricity System Operator, said
that "competition leads to trade and greater interconnectedness," which could
boost reliability.
</P>
<P>
The energy bill signed into law by President Bush on Aug.
8 provides a mechanism for creating mandatory reliability rules. The
legislation allows the federal government to designate a private group,
probably the North American Electric Reliability Council, as an official
"electric reliability organization," with authority to set the rules. But
that group pointed out in its paper that while the
designated organization would assess the adequacy of the system, it
would not have the authority to require anybody to build
a generating station or a transmission line.

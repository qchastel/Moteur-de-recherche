DWP HEAD PROMISES CHANGES IN WAKE OF BLACKOUT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>

<P>
While conceding that utility workers goofed when they
snipped electrical wires that cut power to half of Los
Angeles, DWP and union officials clashed Tuesday over the agency's
response and whether the impact of the outage could have
been minimized.
</P>
<P>
Ron Deaton, general manager of the Department of Water and Power,
told the City Council the incident occurred about 12:30 p.m.
Monday, while workers were upgrading a receiving station in Toluca
Lake. The crew mistakenly cut two wires while the electrical
circuit was still active, setting off a chain-reaction outage that
shut down businesses, stalled elevators, caused massive traffic jams from
the San Fernando Valley to South Los Angeles -- and
sparked fears of a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
"There was a mistake and we are going to take a
look at what happened to make sure it doesn't happen
again," Deaton said. "The good news out of this is
that the system worked the way it was supposed to.
The system protected itself by shutting down, giving us time
to stabilize it and bring it back up."
</P>
<P>
Deaton said the agency is studying ways to reduce the impact
of future outages and how to better inform the public
about problems.
</P>
<P>
But Brian D'Arcy -- head of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, Local 18 -- said the disruption could have been
minimized had the DWP been willing to pay technicians a
higher wage differential to do the work at night, when
power usage is lower.
</P>
<P>
"They shouldn't have done it in the middle of the day
when people are coming back from lunch and turning their
computers on," D'Arcy said.
</P>
<P>
But Deaton questioned the value of doing the work at night.
</P>
<P>
"From a public safety standpoint, I'm not sure we would want
the power out when it's nighttime and dark out," Deaton
said.
</P>
<P>
The IBEW is awaiting City Council action on a controversial five-year
contract that would give its 8,000 members raises of as
much as 30 percent. The union has threatened to strike
Oct. 1 if the contract is not approved.
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from Councilman Dennis Zine, Deaton rejected any suggestion that
the outage was in retaliation for city delays in approving
the deal.
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication this was done on purpose," Deaton said.
"I would point out it was the hardworking DWP employees
who were able to stabilize the system and restore power
in an hour and a half."
</P>
<P>
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa sent a letter to Deaton, ordering a report
within a week that details what happened as well as
the agency's plan to avoid future problems.
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Tony Cardenas and others questioned the time it took
DWP officials to report the cause and extent of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Coming the day after a masked al-Qaida operative sent a videotaped
message pointing to Los Angeles as the next terrorist target
of attacks, the outage escalated tension and fear as officials
and the public waited for word on the cause of
the blackout.
</P>
<P>
"People didn't know what was going on other than the power
was out," said Cardenas, who chairs the council's Commerce, Energy
and Natural Resources Committee, which oversees the DWP.
</P>
<P>
"We had people who were trying to drive across this city
to check on their children and they didn't know if
we were under attack or something else was going on."
</P>
<P>
Deaton defended the DWP's actions, saying he wanted to avoid misinformation.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we knew what had happened, I went down
and met with the news media to tell them what
we knew," Deaton said. "I didn't want to get the
wrong information out there."
</P>
<P>
Cardenas said he was also concerned about security.
</P>
<P>
"There is a particular concern that the department be aware of
the numerous potential vulnerabilities of the system," Cardenas said, adding
he wanted to see a report on the locations where
the entire system could be tripped up as well as
training of workers.
</P>
<P>
Deaton said the work crews involved with the modernization program have
received specialized training and had successfully installed the new equipment
at 39 other locations.
</P>
<P>
The workers were installing automated monitoring controls to provide department officials
with immediate information about the status of its system.
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem at the Toluca Lake site, he said,
is that it is the central point for numerous power
lines coming into the city and its outage triggered a
wider impact than normal.
</P>
<P>
Deaton said his department is working to determine whether a system
can be designed that would limit the size of the
area affected while not damaging the entire electrical system.

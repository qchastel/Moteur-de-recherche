NO LAYOFFS SEEN IN WAKE OF KEYSPAN SALE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With a $7.3 billion deal in hand to take over KeySpan
Corp., British energy giant National Grid PLC said it expects
to wring roughly $200 million a year in savings out
of the two companies, without imposing any layoffs.
</P>
<P>
But how much of that $200 million finds its way back
to the companies' nearly 2 million customers in Massachusetts and
6 million in other states - as opposed to National
Grid shareholders - may not be clear for months. Negotiating
dividends from the takeover for customers will be a key
issue facing utility regulators in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York,
and other states where the two utilities operate.
</P>
<P>
The projected cost savings from uniting the companies amount to about
10 percent of their combined annual operating expenses, according to
Michael E. Jesanis, chief executive of National Grid USA, the
British conglomerate's American unit in Westborough.
</P>
<P>
Some savings will come from job reductions through attrition and early
retirement incentives, as well as combining "back-office functions," selling off
surplus real estate for redevelopment, and using increased buying clout
to get discounts from suppliers and vendors, Jesanis said. The
deal, which the companies hope to close early next year,
would make National Grid one of the three biggest combined
electric and gas utilities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We're quite comfortable that we can meet our efficiency objectives without
having our employees be harmed," Jesanis said. "There's a lot
of other sources of savings besides people." In Massachusetts, National
Grid employs about 2,500 people, KeySpan 1,800.
</P>
<P>
Of the 169 Bay State cities and towns where National Grid
operates, 69 are communities where KeySpan also provides gas service.
</P>
<P>
When National Grid predecessor Massachusetts Electric Co. bought the former Eastern
Edison a utility south of Boston, in 2000, the company
pledged to cut rates and then freeze them for five
years to return some of the savings from combining the
companies to customers. Mass. Electric and later National Grid kept
that promise.
</P>
<P>
Jesanis said National Grid will be open to a range of
possibilities, including rate cuts, rate freezes, or commitments to increase
spending on energy efficiency programs or accelerated gas and electric
system maintenance and upgrades. Asked whether National Grid can commit
to returning a specific fraction of the $200 million annual
savings to ratepayers, Jesanis said, "It's premature to define an
actual split, but we'll certainly be having that discussion with
our regulators. We're quite flexible."
</P>
<P>
Frank Gorke, energy advocate for the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group,
a consumer advocacy organization, said, "The burden is on National
Grid and KeySpan to prove to consumers, regulators that this
is going to be a good deal for consumers."
</P>
<P>
Brian McCarthy, a senior official with the Utility Workers Union of
America, said National Grid has kept to promises to avoid
layoffs in past mergers. "But the fact of the matter
is you have less employment opportunities going forward, and I
question whether these things ever really do result in savings
for the ratepayer or whether they just pass it all
on to the shareholders," McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
In Massachusetts, the Department of Telecommunications and Energy will have only
limited power to review the deal and demand benefits for
ratepayers because it will involve a combination of the holding
companies that own the utilities, not the utilities themselves.
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office, which represents consumers in utility rate
cases, said it will review the transaction.
</P>
<P>
"We will work to make sure that consumers see the benefits
of this deal through the lowest possible rates and high-quality
service," said Sarah Nathan, spokeswoman for Attorney General Thomas F.
Reilly.
</P>
<P>
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who met with top executives of
both companies Monday, said in an interview, "On the surface,
I think it's a good deal. As I see it,
on the face of it, meeting with both teams, I
think it's going to be a benefit to the city.
They're going to continue the programs that they're involved in
the city" including energy efficiency assistance programs for low-income households
and cultural-activity sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
Seth Kaplan, senior attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation, a Boston
environmental group, said both National Grid and KeySpan have made
stronger commitments than most utilities to programs promoting renewable energy
sources for electric generation and energy conservation. "It's a deal
that could have a potential good side to it in
energy efficiency," Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
National Grid will probably continue to use the "very good KeySpan
name" for gas operations, at least for the near term,
Jesanis said.
</P>
<P>
In recent months the company has replaced several venerable corporate monikers
including Mass. Electric, Narragansett Electric in Rhode Island, and Niagara
Mohawk in New York, with the National Grid brand.

Afghanistan's public health minister asked Indian officials on Friday to help
bring modern health care to his war-ravaged nation, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan will set up a countrywide network of "telemedicine" centers with the
help of India's space agency, the Indian Space Research Organization, said Abdul
Salam Jalali, a member of the delegation.
</P>
<P>
Telemedicine centers are located in areas where hospitals don't exist or
specialists are not available. They are equipped with a computer, video camera,
clinical equipment and a satellite connection which allow doctors in another
location to examine patients.
</P>
<P>
He said Afghan Public Health Minister Syed Mohammed Amin Fatimie held talks with
officials of India's health and family welfare ministry and visited hospitals in
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"Two and a half decades of war and internal fighting have destroyed our
infrastructure, including health care facilities," Jalali said in the southern
city of Bangalore.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, Afghanistan will set up telemedicine centers in 11 cities,
including Kabul, Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif, Jalali said. The first center in
Kabul will become operational in early 2006, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jalali, also the director of the Indira Gandhi Institute for child health, a
hospital in Kabul set up with Indian assistance, said Afghanistan lacks
specialists to provide advanced medical care in several disciplines. Afghan
hospitals are in talks with several Indian hospitals to enable these patients to
get treated in India at affordable rates, he said.

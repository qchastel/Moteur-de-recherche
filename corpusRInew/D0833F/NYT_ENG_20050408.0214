<P>
Federal prosecutors investigating the smuggling of nuclear technology disclosed
Friday that a South African businessman has pleaded guilty to
arranging illegal exports of American-made equipment both to Pakistan and
its regional rival, India.
</P>
<P>
Asher Karni, an Israeli who lives in South Africa, entered the
guilty plea in September and has been cooperating with investigators,
prosecutors said. The prosecutors kept the proceeding secret until Friday,
however, when they unsealed the plea agreement and charges they
have brought against Humayun Khan, an Islamabad businessman with longstanding
ties to Pakistan's military. Khan is said to be Karni's
partner.
</P>
<P>
As part of Karni's plea agreement, he acknowledged that he also
was involved in 2002 in selling sophisticated electronic equipment to
government agencies in India, some of which are involved in
nuclear weapons and missile research. It is not clear whether
the goods he sold were useful for making nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The disclosures in the two cases shed additional light on the
black market trade in nuclear-related equipment to countries regarded as
proliferation risks. They provide new details on the smuggling operations
and, for the first time, indicate that India, as well
as Pakistan, sought at least some banned equipment.
</P>
<P>
Khan's indictment states that he employed Karni in 2002 and 2003
to purchase 200 high-speed electrical switches that can be used
in a nuclear device, as well as oscilloscopes, and to
export them to Pakistan without the required U.S. export licenses.
The switches, known as triggered spark gaps, are used in
medical equipment but also have military applications, including as detonators
for nuclear weapons, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Khan is believed to be in Pakistan and a Pakistani embassy
official said he was unaware of an American request to
have him detained. Efforts to reach Khan on Friday were
unsuccessful, but in interviews, including one with The New York
Times in 2004, he has denied smuggling American-made triggers to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Because of the large number of triggers sought, American officials said
they strongly suspected the devices were intended for government agencies
involved in nuclear weapons work in Pakistan and possibly other
countries seeking nuclear weapons. Several U.S. officials said that they
have not been able to tie the Pakistani government directly
to the trigger purchases.
</P>
<P>
A senior Commerce Department official said Friday that, with Karni's help,
the investigation has turned up indications that Khan was involved
in sales of nuclear-related technology to countries other than Pakistan
using a network of suppliers and middlemen similar to that
used by A.Q Khan, the Pakistani nuclear scientist who confessed
in 2004 to providing nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and
North Korea for more than a decade. The two Khans
are not believed to be related, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Humayun Khan is a black marketeer involved in the proliferation of
nuclear weapons and once this is all spelled out we're
going to see the same scale of network that A.Q.
Khan was involved in," said the Commerce Department official. The
official would not identify countries other than Pakistan that the
United States suspects of involvement with Humayun Khan.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Sadiq, deputy chief of mission at Pakistan's embassy in Washington,
denied that Humayun Khan was involved in procuring triggers or
other equipment for its nuclear program. "I'm not aware of
why Humayun Khan was buying these," Sadiq said. "The government
of Pakistan has nothing to do with this, that is
for sure."
</P>
<P>
American investigators have not been able to interview Khan in person,
they said. Sadiq said he was not aware that any
formal request to question Khan had been made by U.S.
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Karni, the Israeli businessman who worked with Khan, was arrested in
Denver in 2004 after traveling to the United States with
his family for a vacation. Karni ran a company called
Top-Cape Technology from Cape Town, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Karni's relationship with Khan began in 2002 when the Pakistani asked
him to buy an oscilloscope manufactured by Tektronix Inc. of
Beaverton, Ore., according to the documents released on Friday. Such
devices display graphs of electric signals and have numerous applications,
including in weapons research. He warned Karni to "approach these
cases carefully as all items are controlled," according to an
e-mail message quoted in Khan's indictment, which says that Karni
eventually shipped three oscilloscopes to Pakistani companies that were clients
of Khan.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, Khan sent an e-mail message seeking triggered spark gaps
and advising Khan not to "disclose the end destination." In
July of that year, an unidentified informant tipped off Commerce
Department and customs agents about Karni's activities. The American supplier,
Perkin Elmer Optoelectronics of Salem, Mass., agreed to cooperate in
the case, sending 66 disabled triggers in a shipment to
Pakistan, routed through South Africa and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
In one transaction, Karni was asked by Humtek Communications in Bangalore,
India, to buy electrical components for India's Space Applications Center,
which works on rockets and is barred from receiving advanced
American technology.

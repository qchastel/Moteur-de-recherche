India, France to develop satellite to study atmospheric conditions
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The space agencies of India and France signed an agreement on Friday
to cooperate in launching a satellite in four years that will help
make climate predictions more accurate.
</P>
<P>
The project, named Megha-Tropiques, "is a major milestone in the
long-standing relationship between Indian and French space agencies,"
G. Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
ISRO and the French National Space Center, known by its French
acronym CNES, signed the memorandum of understanding following five
years of talks.
</P>
<P>
ISRO will build the satellite, launch it sometime between April 2008
and March 2009, and control the spacecraft in space. CNES will build
the scientific instruments that will observe atmospheric conditions
and send back data.
</P>
<P>
ISRO will spend about US$24 million (euro18.6 million), while CNES
will contribute US$62 million (euro48 million) to the mission, the
agencies said.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will track tropical atmospheric conditions, such as
rain above oceans, monsoon patterns, humidity, water vapor and
radiation, that have an impact on global climatic changes.
</P>
<P>
"These systems interact with the general atmospheric circulation in
ways we still do not fully understand _ one reason why weather
forecasts and predictions of climatic events such as cyclones,
monsoons, flooding and drought are not more accurate," CNES said.
</P>
<P>
"The Megha-Tropiques mission will improve our understanding of these
processes," it said.

<P>
The delay in Ariane space 
program has forced the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) 
to reschedule the launch of INSAT-4A around August-September this 
year.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was to be launched in the first half of 2005.

Confirming this, ISRO chief G. Madhavan Nair said in Bangalore 
on Monday that the European Space Agency (ESA), which is in charge
of the Ariane launch program, had sought more time to launch the 
Indian spacecraft in the INSAT-4 series.
</P>
<P>
"The launch is likely to take place either in the last week of 
August or first week of September. Ariane has faced some 
difficulty and delay in launching the first two satellites of 
other countries. INSAT-4A is the third launch for the ESA this 
year," Nair said on the sidelines of a twin conference on 
planetary exploration and space laws in Bangalore.
</P>
<P>
The Indian satellite will be launched from French Guyana in 
South America. The three-ton INSAT-4A will have 12 Ku band 
transponders for direct-to-home (DTH) satellite-link telecast 
applications and 12 C band communication transponders.
</P>
<P>
INSAT-4A is the first in the INSAT-4 series, which is planned 
to have seven satellites. INSAT will have about 225 active 
transponders in various frequency bands by 2007, which can cater 
to the demand up to 11 GBPS capacity with the present day 
technology.

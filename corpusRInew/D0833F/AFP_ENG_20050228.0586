India is "a step ahead" of China in 
satellite technology and can surpass Beijing in space research by 
tapping the talent of its huge pool of young scientists, India's 
space research chief said Monday.

<P>
G Madhavan Nair said India and China were "on par (with each 
other) as far as rocket technology is concerned," the Press Trust of 
India news agency reported.

<P>
Though China was ahead in planning a manned mission to the moon, 
"We are a step ahead of China in satellite technology," Nair, chief 
of the Indian Space Research Organisation, told a gathering in the 
southern city of Coimbatore.

<P>
Two years ago, India announced it would launch a mission to the 
moon -- the Chandrayan-I or Moon Vehicle I -- by 2007.
</P>
<P>
The 590-kilogram (1,298-pound) Chandrayan-1 is expected to map 
the lunar terrain for minerals and conduct scientific experiments.
</P>
<P>
The 2007 mission also aims at landing a small probe -- an 
"impacter" module weighing about 20 kilograms (44 pounds) -- on the 
surface of the moon.
</P>
<P>
Besides India, the United States, the European Space Agency, 
China and Japan are planning lunar missions during the next decade.

NEW DELHI, June 27 (Xinhua)-- India's first unmanned moon 
mission planned for 2007-08 will carry three European payloads for
conducting various experiments relating to the lunar surface.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) Monday signed a 
memorandum of understanding with the European Space Agency (ESA) 
for carrying the payloads aboard the Chandrayaan 1 (the name given
to India's mission Moon) spacecraft, in Bangalore on Monday.

<P>
Bangalore, the capital city of Karnataka in South India, is 
hosting a twin conference on "Advances in Planetary Exploration" 
and "Bringing Space Benefits to the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
The three-day international event, which is being attended by 
some 225 delegates, including 75 from the US, China, Japan, Canada,
France, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, began in Bangalore 
today.
</P>
<P>
ISRO is also in discussion with the US National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) to carry American payloads on board 
the Chandrayaan spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
A MoU with NASA is expected to be signed in the next couple of 
months once the instruments and their role are finalized.
</P>
<P>
ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair, who inaugurated the conference,
said that the US payload would weigh some 10-15 kg and comprise an
X-ray detector, a particle detector and a multi-spectral imager.
</P>
<P>
The ESA payload would comprise instruments from Britain, 
Bulgaria and Germany. These include D-CIXS, a low energy X-ray 
fluorescence spectrometer and an X-ray solar monitor from Britain,
RADAM, a radiation dose monitor from Bulgaria, and SIR-2, a 
spectrometer from Germany." The Chandrayaan 1 will place a 
spacecraft weighing about 525 kg in an orbit of the moon to enable
high resolution chemical, mineralogical and photo-geological 
mapping of the lunar surface to define the process leading to the 
formation and chemical evolution of the moon," Nair said.
</P>
<P>
"We have the capabilities to develop and manage a mission that 
would orbit the moon and enable a series of observations and 
measurements using specific instruments, Nair added.

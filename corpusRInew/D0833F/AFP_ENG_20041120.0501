India's space agency is ready to send a man to space within seven
years if the government gives the nod, while preparations have
already begun for the launch of an unmanned lunar mission, a top
official said.
</P>
<P>
Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation
(ISRO), the country's premier space agency, said the scientific
community in the country had already started a debate on the manned
mission.
</P>
<P>
"The question of a manned mission is glaring before us now," Nair
told AFP ahead of a lunar conference which kicks off in the northern
Indian city of Udaipur on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The thought process has begun and various agencies have come up with
ideas. Whether it is now or later is a question to be considered,"
Nair said.
</P>
<P>
"We have not taken it up to the government level yet. But if we are
asked to ... and are given adequate funding, we can achieve it in six
to seven years from today," he said.
</P>
<P>
India sent its first astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, aboard Soviet
spacecraft Salyut 7 in April 1984 while another astronaut, Kalpana
Chawla, was killed along with six others in the Columbia shuttle
disaster in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Nair said "a lot of debate" had to take place in India before a final
decision is taken on a manned space flight.
</P>
<P>
"The benefits and the costs involved have to be examined. Various
facilities and equipment such as a space capsule for human
habitation, shielding, control and safety features have to be built
-- a large amount of funding is required," he said.
</P>
<P>
India's unmanned lunar flight, Chandrayaan (Moon Journey), slated to
launch by the end of 2007 or early 2008, was on schedule, Nair said.
</P>
<P>
"The design work for Chandrayaan has been completed and we are in the
phase of implementing various types of prototypes," he said.
"Building instruments and calibrating them to match exact conditions
on the moon is a big challenge.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect any difficulty with respect to the spacecraft and
launch vehicle. The acquisition of land for deep space exploration
has also been completed. Things are progressing well for the
targetted launch latest by early 2008," he said.
</P>
<P>
The mission, to place a 525 kilogram (1,125 pound) orbiter using an
indigenously-built polar satellite launch vehicle, is slated to cost
the agency 83 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will go around the polar orbit about 100 kilometers (62
miles) above the moon.
</P>
<P>
Critics have slammed the mission saying it is outdated and the
organisation was wasting its money from a limited budget of 25
billion rupees (543 million dollars) allotted by the government.
</P>
<P>
They say cash-strapped India should not undertake the mission but
instead restrict its space programmes to satellite launches and use
its funds for social welfare.
</P>
<P>
But ISRO chief Nair defended the mission and said it would spur the
Indian scientconference in Udaipur is being attended by about 200
Indian and foreign delegates from countries such as the United
States, Europe, Japan, Russia and China.

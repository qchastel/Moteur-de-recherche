A three-member Afghan 
delegation is in Bangalore seeking help to set up a high-tech 
telemedicine facility in 10 Afghan cities linked via Indian 
satellites, Indo-Asian News Service reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The satellite-based networks that will be established later 
this year with the help of the Indian Space Research Organization 
(ISRO) will offer connectivity to major hospitals in India to 
improve healthcare in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
An ISRO team will visit Afghanistan soon to install the network
at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Chid Health (IGICH) which will 
be linked with New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences
(AIIMS).
</P>
<P>
After the recent visits of Afghan President Hamid Karzai to 
Delhi and Indian foreign minister K. Natwar Singh to Kabul last 
month, the Afghan health ministry decided to upgrade IGICH with a 
polyclinic, a diagnostic center and a surgical block, IGICH 
director Abdul Salam Jalali told media.
</P>
<P>
After the telemedicine network becomes operational in Kabul, 
the ISRO and the Afghan health ministry will jointly work on 
expanding the facility to other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has a population of 23-25 million, a majority of 
the people scattered in semi-urban and rural areas where public 
health system has remained neglected due to the quarter century of
strife, civil war and Talibanization, Jalali recalled.

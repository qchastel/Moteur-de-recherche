The US House of 
Representatives on Wednesday approved a 6.1-billion-dollar package
of tax breaks to help families recover from Hurricane Katrina 
which hit the Gulf Coast areas late last month.
</P>
<P>
The House passed the bill with a vote of 422-0 and the bill has
been sent to the US Senate, where lawmakers hoped to quickly give 
their final approval.
</P>
<P>
The package offers tax assistance to people and businesses 
dislocated by Hurricane Katrina and expanded tax breaks for some 
charitable donations to help them.
</P>
<P>
The tax breaks waive penalties for hurricane victims who need 
cash for expenses and recovery and want to use money stashed in 
protected retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
Also under the bill, families that rely on the child tax credit
and the earned income tax credit could protect those benefits 
throughout job losses, residency changes and family separations 
caused by Hurricane Katrina.

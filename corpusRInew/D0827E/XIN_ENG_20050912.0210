<P>
Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world's
second largest reinsurance company on Monday doubled to 40 billion
US dollars its initial estimate of the global insured losses 
caused by Hurricane Katrina in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Re had previously agreed with the world's largest 
reinsurer, Munich Re, that the total losses would be 20 billion 
dollars. The revised estimate has made Katrina the most costly 
hurricane in history.
</P>
<P>
The loss estimate was significantly increased because the 
damage caused by the hurricane was bigger than thought, 
Zurich-based Swiss Re said.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the unique nature of the event, the complexity and the
magnitude of destruction caused, accurate claims estimates remain 
difficult," it said.
</P>
<P>
Katrina has become the most costly hurricane in history, 
overtaking Hurricane Andrew in 1992, when claims reached 22 
billion dollars, according to Swiss Re figures.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Re also more than doubled to 1.2 billion dollars the 
estimate of the claims the company itself may face. The company 
may not able to meet its target of 10 percent growth in earnings 
per share this year, but it said it will use its reserves to 
cushion the impact of the hurricane.

Lloyd's, the world's biggest insurance 
underwriting market, said Wednesday that it had provisionally 
forecast a 1.4 billion-pound (2.08 billion-euro, 2.55 
billion-dollar) net loss owing to Hurricane Katrina.
</P>
<P>
"Lloyds provisional estimate is that the markets net loss as a 
result of Hurricane Katrina is 1.4 billion pounds," it said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
"It should be stressed that it will not be possible, for some 
time, to have a precise view of the ultimate insured loss because 
this is a complex catastrophe, the full extent of the damage is 
unknown and the loss is still ongoing," it added.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's said that its estimated loss was comparable with the 
impact of the four US windstorms in 2004, that resulted in a net 
loss to the market of 1.3 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Re, the world's second largest re-insurer, said on Monday 
that it expected the total loss to the global insurance industry 
from Katrina to be around 40 billion dollars (32 billion euros).
</P>
<P>
British company Brit Insurance meanwhile last week forecast that 
the hurricane could leave the world's insurers facing a bill of up 
to 50 billion dollars.

<P>
Hurricane Katrina has claimed the lives of at least 650 people 
after hitting the southern US states of Lousiana, Mississippi, 
Alabama and Florida at the end of August.

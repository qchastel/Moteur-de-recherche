U.S. federal appeals court grants additional review in Schiavo case

<P>
A U.S. federal appeals court early Wednesday agreed to consider a petition by
Terri Schiavo's parents for a new hearing on whether to reconnect their severely
brain-damaged daughter's feeding tube.
</P>
<P>
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled without comment on Schiavo's 12th
day without nourishment. Last week, the same court twice ruled against Schiavo's
parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, who are trying to keep her alive.
</P>
<P>
In seeking a new hearing late Tuesday, attorneys for Schiavo's parents argued
that the District Court "committed plain error when it reviewed only the state
court case and outcome history."
</P>
<P>
Now, the court will consider the request for a new hearing, rather than whether
previous Florida court rulings have met legal standards under state law, which
is what federal courts have done in the case until now.
</P>
<P>
Terri Schiavo's feeding tube was removed March 18 on a court order sought by her
husband, Michael Schiavo, who contends she wouldn't want to be kept alive
artificially.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have said Terri Schiavo, 41, would probably die within a week or two of
the tube being removed. She suffered catastrophic brain damage in 1990 when her
heart stopped for several minutes because of a chemical imbalance apparently
brought on by an eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
Bob Schindler described his daughter as "failing" following his visit
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"She still looks pretty darn good under the circumstances," Schindler said. "You
can see the impact of no food and water for 12 days. Her bodily functions are
still working. We still have her."
</P>
<P>
Federal courts were given jurisdiction to review Schiavo's case after
Republicans in Congress pushed through unprecedented emergency legislation aimed
at prolonging Schiavo's life. But federal courts at two levels rebuffed the
family.
</P>
<P>
Anita Fanshaw, 43, one of about 10 protesters outside Schiavo's hospice in
Pinellas Park, Florida, praised Wednesday's court decision.
</P>
<P>
"God has a way of making things work," she said.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Schindlers and Schiavo's husband didn't immediately return
phone messages early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson prayed with the Schindlers and joined
conservatives in calling for state lawmakers to order her feeding tube
reinserted.
</P>
<P>
The former Democratic presidential candidate was invited by Schiavo's parents to
meet with activists outside Schiavo's hospice. His arrival was greeted by some
applause and cries of "This is about civil rights!"
</P>
<P>
"I feel so passionate about this injustice being done, how unnecessary it is to
deny her a feeding tube, water, not even ice to be used for her parched lips,"
he said. "This is a moral issue and it transcends politics and family
disputes."
</P>
<P>
Mary Schindler later made a terse but emotional appeal to Michael Schiavo:
"Michael and Jodi, you have your own children. Please, please give my child back
to me." Michael Schiavo and fiancee Jodi Centonze have two children, born long
after Terri Schiavo's collapse.
</P>
<P>
Although supporters of the Schindlers have claimed the dehydrated woman is being
denied comfort measures such as ice chips for her dry mouth or balm for chapped
lips, George Felos, the husband's attorney, defended how Schiavo is being cared
for.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the parents and the siblings are desperate. Desperation may lead to
different perceptions," Felos told CNN. "I can only tell you what I've seen, and
Terri is dying a very peaceful, cared-for death."
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he asked Michael Schiavo for permission to see the brain-damaged
woman but was denied. He also telephoned black legislators in a last-ditch
effort to bring back a bill that would prohibit severely brain-damaged patients
from being denied food and water if they didn't express their wishes in writing.
Lawmakers rejected the legislation earlier this month and appeared unlikely to
reconsider it.
</P>
<P>
First lady Laura Bush also commented on the case Tuesday, saying the government
was right to have intervened on behalf of Schiavo.
</P>
<P>
"It is a life issue that really does require government to be involved," Bush
said aboard a plane bound for Afghanistan, where she was to promote education
and women's rights.
</P>
<P>
During Jackson's visit, a man was tackled to the ground by officers when he
tried to storm into the hospice, police said. He became the 47th protester
arrested since the feeding tube was removed March 18. The man had two bottles of
water with him but did not reach the hospice door, police said.
</P>
<P>
The parents had lost a round in the courts Tuesday when an appeals court upheld
a previous ruling by Judge George Greer that blocked the Department of Children
and Families from intervening in the case.

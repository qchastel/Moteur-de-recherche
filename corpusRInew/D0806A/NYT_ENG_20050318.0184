FLORIDA WOMAN'S FEEDING TUBE IS REMOVED, BUT FIGHT CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>

PINELLAS PARK, Fla.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors on Friday removed the feeding tube
of Terri Schiavo, the severely brain-damaged woman at the center
of a scorching multiyear legal battle, despite an extraordinary series
of last-minute efforts by Congress to halt the process and
prolong her life.
</P>
<P>
The tube's removal came at 1:45 p.m., shortly after a state
judge bluntly rejected attempts by the House of Representatives to
intervene in the case, saying it had no jurisdiction. The
judge, George W. Greer of Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court, turned down
a House request for a nine-day postponement so that members
of the House Government Reform Committee could travel from Washington
to hold a meeting in Schiavo's hospice room here.
</P>
<P>
"I see no cogent reason why the committee should be able
to intervene into a case involving the decision of whether
or not to remain on life support," Greer, who has
presided over Schiavo's case since 1998, said in a hearing
held by telephone conference. "I don't think that legislative agencies
or bodies have business in court proceedings."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the House committee issued subpoenas for Schiavo,
41, and her husband, Michael, to appear at congressional hearings
later this month. A Senate committee made a similar move.
Since Schiavo is incapacitated and cannot speak, the lawmakers' were
hoping that by issuing a subpoena they could block the
removal of the feeding tube through a law intended to
protect people called to testify before Congress.
</P>
<P>
Without the liquid meals that have sustained her for the last
15 years, Schiavo will likely not survive more than two
weeks, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of her feeding tube is the latest chapter of
a saga pitting her husband, who believes she has no
cognition and wants her to die, against her parents, who
believe she responds to their voices and can improve with
therapy. Schiavo was 26 when her heart briefly stopped beating
one night in 1990, starving her brain of oxygen long
enough to cause extensive damage. Doctors have said she was
suffering a potassium deficiency, possibly due to an eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
While the prolonged battle over her fate had largely been concentrated
in the Florida courts and Legislature, it burst onto the
national political scene this week as conservative lawmakers rushed to
take up her case as a symbol of the sanctity
of life.
</P>
<P>
"She has constitutional rights to live," said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas,
the House majority leader, "and we are trying to protect
her constitutional right to live and more important than that,
her constitutional right not to have somebody else decide her
future by pulling out a feeding tube and letting her
starve for two weeks."
</P>
<P>
Scott McClellan, President Bush's spokesman, said the White House was watching
the developments in Florida. "The president believes that when there
are serious questions or doubts in a case like this,
that the presumption ought to be in the favor of
life," he said.
</P>
<P>
In their efforts to win support for their cause, Schiavo's parents,
Robert and Mary Schindler, have circulated pictures and videos of
their daughter appearing to smile at her mother, track a
balloon with her eyes and respond to other stimuli from
her bed at Woodside Hospice, where she has lived since
2000. Television stations around the world have played the images
repeatedly in recent weeks, but most doctors say that what
appear to be emotion and cognition are in fact involuntary
reflexes.
</P>
<P>
A series of courts have accepted the testimony of doctors who
say Schiavo is in a "persistent vegetative state," meaning she
does not comprehend language or expressions or interact with others.
</P>
<P>
Yet Barbara Weller, a lawyer for the Schindlers, told reporters outside
the hospice that Schiavo had responded emphatically Friday morning when
Weller asked her to say, "I want to live." According
to Weller, Schiavo's eyes "just popped right open" and she
made loud noises, startling a police officer stationed outside her
room, then wept.
</P>
<P>
Michael Schiavo's chief lawyer, George Felos, described federal efforts to delay
the tube removal as "thuggery" and an assault on civil
liberties. He said that lawmakers had no intention of investigating
the case and were merely pandering to constituents who were
pressuring them to intervene.
</P>
<P>
"It was odious, it was shocking, it was disgusting and I
think all Americans should be alarmed," Felos said.
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, Republicans justified their actions by saying they were
taking the steps necessary to protect potential evidence and witnesses
that could be needed for Senate and House investigations into
the care of incapacitated adults.
</P>
<P>
"We're holding a legitimate legislative inquiry," said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.,
chairman of the Government Reform Committee, after he authorized subpoenas
in the case.
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, the Health committee issued an invitation to Terri
Schiavo to appear at a hearing, a move that congressional
officials said could result in criminal charges against anyone who
impedes her attendance.
</P>
<P>
The flurry of congressional action came after the House and Senate
failed Thursday to agree on legislation that could take the
case out of state courts, an impasse that continued Friday.
</P>
<P>
State legislators in Tallahassee also failed this week to pass legislation
that might block the feeding tube's removal, despite intense pressure
from Gov. Jeb Bush and conservative religious groups, who bombarded
lawmakers with e-mail. Those groups say they are against ending
any life prematurely and equate the withdrawal of Schiavo's feeding
tube with abortion.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Randall Terry, founder of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, said he
and other conservatives would continue lobbying Congress and the Florida
Legislature to pass bills that could prolong Schiavo's life. In
particular, he said, they would urge the House of Representatives
to take up a bill passed by the Senate Thursday,
which would set up a federal court hearing in cases
like Schiavo's to evaluate whether the state had followed all
requirements for judicial due process.
</P>
<P>
"We will hold the House leadership accountable if this thing fails,"
said Terry, who acted as a spokesman for the Schindlers
outside the hospice Friday. "The conservative right of this country
has labored fiercely for two decades to finally get control
of both houses. We didn't get here so they could
pour this down the drain."
</P>
<P>
After Schiavo's feeding tube was removed, Republican leaders of Congress expressed
strong disappointment and pledged to work through the weekend to
try to strike an agreement on legislation that could shift
the case into federal court.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, murder is being committed against a defenseless American citizen
in Florida," DeLay said. "Terri Schiavo's feeding tube should be
immediately replaced, and Congress will continue working to explore ways
to save her."
</P>
<P>
Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, steered clear of the issue for the most
part, though some continued to wonder if Congress should be
so deeply involved.
</P>
<P>
"I intend to do all I can to see that any
action Congress takes is constructive and free from partisan politics,
and does not make a tragic situation worse by exploiting
this terrible tragedy," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts,
the senior Democrat on the health committee.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with reporters, DeLay, joined by other senior Republicans,
again insisted that the best way to resolve the deadlock
was for the Senate to on Monday approve a much
broader House-passed measure that would apply new federal legal protection
in all such cases.
</P>
<P>
But Senate officials were pessimistic they could force the House bill
through since it had drawn strong objections from members of
both parties previously.
</P>
<P>
DeLay and Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri, the majority whip, said
their viewing of videotape of Schiavo convinced them she wanted
to live and they were not persuaded by her husband's
claim that she would prefer to be allowed to die.
</P>
<P>
"I think the sanctity of life overshadows the sanctity of marriage,"
said DeLay.

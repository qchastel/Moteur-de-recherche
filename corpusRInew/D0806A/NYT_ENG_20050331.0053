FOLLOWING PROTRACTED COURT BATTLE, TERRI SCHIAVO DIES

PINELLAS PARK, Fla.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terri Schiavo, the severely brain damaged Florida
woman who became the subject of an intense legal and
political battle that drew responses from the White House to
the Halls of Congress to the Vatican, died Thursday, 13
days after her feeding tube was removed on the order
of a state court judge.
</P>
<P>
Schiavo, 41, died just before 10 a.m. Thursday in the Pinellas
Park hospice where she had lived, off and on, for
several years, her parents' attorney said. But even as she
died, the searing emotions that surrounded her final days remained,
following a national debate over whether she should have been
reconnected to a tube that provided her with nourishment and
hydration.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer, David Gibbs, said Schiavo's brother and sister were with
Schiavo until just before she died.
</P>
<P>
"While they are heartsick, this is indeed a sad day for
the nation, this is a sad day for the family,"
Gibbs said. "Their faith in God remains consistent and strong.
They are absolutely convinced that God loves Terri more than
they do. They believe that Terri is now ultimately at
peace with God himself.
</P>
<P>
"They intend to comfort themselves with their faith and with their
family at this time."
</P>
<P>
CNN reported that Schiavo's husband, Michael, was with her when she
died.
</P>
<P>
Her parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, came to the hospice shortly
after they learned of her death and prayed at her
bedside, said Brother Paul O'Donnell, a Franciscan Friar who has
served as a spokesman for the parents. They left shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
As word of her death spread through the crowd outside the
hospice, some people sang hymns, others began praying.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Schiavo died, her body was transported to the medical
examiner's office, where an autopsy will be performed, at her
husband's request.
</P>
<P>
Just before noon, President Bush said he was saddened to hear
of Schiavo's death.
</P>
<P>
"I urge all those who honor Terri Schiavo to continue to
work to build a culture of life, where all Americans
are welcomed and valued and protected," the president said, "especially
those who live at the mercy of others.
</P>
<P>
"The essence of civilization is that the strong have a duty
to protect the weak. In cases where there are serious
doubts and questions, the presumption should be in the favor
of life."
</P>
<P>
Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, who had tried to intervene in the
matter several times to keep Schiavo connected to her feeding
tube, said after learning of her death that "this issue
transcends politics and policies." He also called this "the toughest
issue" in his tenure.
</P>
<P>
"Her experience will heighten awareness of the importance of families dealing
with end-of-life issues, and that is an incredible legacy," he
said. "The politics takes care of itself.
</P>
<P>
"As a society, as we live longer, it's important for us
to deal with these issues. I wish I could have
done more. That's the sadness in my heart."
</P>
<P>
The fight between Schiavo's husband to have his wife's feeding tube
removed, saying he was fulfilling her wish not to live
in a vegetative state, and her parents, who said she
could still recover if she was given proper treatment, lasted
seven years and made its way from the state courts
to the Supreme Court, and back again, several times. On
Wednesday night, the Supreme Court refused, for the sixth time,
to intervene in the matter.
</P>
<P>
The family's dispute also resulted in a new state law in
Florida and an emergency session of the House of Representatives
that produced a new federal law signed by President Bush
in the early hours of the morning of March 21.
</P>
<P>
A range of judges consistently sided with Michael Schiavo, but her
parents would not give up, going from court to court
and appealing to politicians and to people who believed that
removing the tube was tantamount to taking a life.
</P>
<P>
"Not only has Mrs. Schiavo's case been given due process, but
few, if any similar cases have ever been afforded this
heightened level of process," Chief Judge Chris Altenbernd, of the
2nd Court of Appeal in Florida, wrote earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The legal fight provoked a great national discussion, with polls showing
most people did not believe politicians should be involved in
personal issues of one family trying to decide whether a
family member should be kept alive. But it also provoked
a great outcry among an ad hoc coalition of Catholic
and evangelical lobbyists, street organizers and legal advisers, some of
whom demonstrated outside the hospice in recent days, and picketed
outside the homes of Michael Schiavo and Judge George W.
Greer of Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court, who originally ordered the tube
removed.
</P>
<P>
Snippets of a video tape the Schindlers made of their daughter
three years ago in which she appears to be smiling,
grunting and moaning in response to her mother's voice, and
to follow a balloon with her eyes, has become ingrained
in the national consciousness after being replayed on news channels
over and over again.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Theresa Marie Schiavo was born Dec. 3, 1963, and grew up
in Huntingdon Valley, Pa. She was the oldest child of
Robert and Mary Schindler, a shy, sensitive girl who loved
animals, John Denver and "Starsky and Hutch." She struggled with
her weight but lost more than 50 pounds in her
senior year of high school.
</P>
<P>
The newly thin Terri Schindler met Michael Schiavo in her second
semester at Bucks County Community College. He was her first
and only boyfriend. They became engaged after five months of
dating and married in 1984 in a large, formal Roman
Catholic wedding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Within two years the couple moved to St. Petersburg, Fla., where
he worked as a restaurant manager and she as an
insurance company clerk. The Schindlers shortly followed with their younger
children, Bobby and Suzanne, and Schiavo continued her close relationship
with her family while her husband worked nights. She also
grew even thinner and had no luck becoming pregnant even
after she consulted a fertility specialist. She weighed no more
than 110 pounds on Feb. 26, 1990, the day her
ordinary life changed irrevocably.
</P>
<P>
Michael Schiavo said he heard a thud about 4 a.m. and
rose from bed to find his wife collapsed on the
floor. By the time paramedics arrived and resuscitated her, oxygen
depletion had caused grievous brain damage. Doctors said her heart
had stopped because of an undiagnosed potassium deficiency, possibly a
result of bulimia. They said she had lapsed into a
persistent vegetative state, meaning she could breathe on her own
and had periods of wakefulness, but was incapable of thought,
memory or emotion. Mr. Schiavo tried for several years to
rehabilitate his wife, even taking her to California for an
experimental brain treatment, but nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
He filed a malpractice suit against the obstetrician who had overseen
Schiavo's fertility therapy, contending that the potassium deficiency should have
been detected. In January 1993, the couple was awarded $750,000
in economic damages for her and $300,000 for loss of
companionship for him.
</P>
<P>
A month later, on Valentine's Day, both the Schindlers and Schiavo
say, a fight over the award signaled the beginning of
their estrangement. The way Mr. Schiavo has described it, he
was visiting his wife when the Schindlers walked in and
Mr. Schindler asked how much money he would receive from
Mr. Schiavo's part of the malpractice settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Schindlers say the fight was about what treatment their daughter's
money would go toward, with the Schindlers advocating rigorous therapy
and Mr. Schiavo wanting basic care. As the rift deepened,
Mr. Schiavo's hopes for his wife's recovery apparently evaporated. In
1994, court records show, he decided not to have her
treated for a urinary tract infection, a move prompted, he
later testified, by her doctor's advice.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 Mr. Schiavo petitioned the local probate court for permission
to remove his wife's feeding tube, a move the Schindlers
immediately challenged.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, Judge George W. Greer of Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court gave
Mr. Schiavo permission to remove his wife's feeding tube after
a monthlong trial in which Mr. Schiavo and two of
his relatives testified that on several occasions, Schiavo had told
them she would not want to be kept alive artificially.
</P>
<P>
Schiavo's feeding tube was first removed in April 2001, but was
reinserted after only two days so that her parents could
present new evidence.
</P>
<P>
The case first drew national attention in October 2003, when Greer
ordered the tube removed a second time. After six days,
Governor Bush and the state legislature intervened.
</P>
<P>
The legislature rushed through a law empowering Gov. Bush to order
the tube reinserted, overriding years of court rulings and infuriating
Mr. Schiavo, who sued on grounds that the measure was
unconstitutional. The Florida Supreme Court agreed with him and knocked
down the law, but it prolonged the case, and Schiavo's
life, for well over a year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Greer ordered that Schiavo's feeding tube be removed for
the third and final time on March 18. But with
her parents stepping up their fight, even President Bush and
Congress tried to avert her death with an unprecedented law
that let the Schindlers take their case to a federal
court.
</P>
<P>
In a series of events, Congress passed the measure on March
21 just after midnight, less than three days after doctors
removed the tube as protesters gathered outside Schiavo's hospice. President
Bush, who had rushed back to Washington from his Texas
ranch to sign it, did so in the middle of
the night.
</P>
<P>
Its backers hoped that the law would lead a federal court
to quickly order Schiavo's feeding tube reinserted, at least giving
her parents more time to press their case. But one
court after another turned down the parents, with the latest
defeat coming Wednesday night, when the Supreme Court again refused
to take up the matter.
</P>
<P>
Her parents, devout Catholics, even attracted the attention of the Vatican.
Last year, they filed a motion to set aside the
judge's authorization to remove the feeding tube, pointing to Pope
John Paul II's statement in the spring that it was
wrong to withhold food and water from people in vegetative
states.
</P>
<P>
The Vatican, which typically stays out of local affairs, has recently
been pointed about Schiavo. On March 21, the Vatican's official
newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, said: "Who can judge the dignity and
sacredness of the life of a human being, made in
the image and likeness of God? Who can decide to
pull the plug as if we were talking about a
broken or out-of-order household appliance?"
</P>
<P>
Thursday, after hearing of her death, Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins, head
of the Vatican's office for sainthood, told reporters that pulling
Schiavo's feeding tube had been "an attack against God," The
Associated Press said.

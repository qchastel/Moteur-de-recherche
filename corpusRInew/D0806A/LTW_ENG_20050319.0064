Congress Crafts Plan for Court to Hear Schiavo Case
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the clock running down on how much longer Terri
Schiavo can remain alive, congressional leaders Saturday announced an
unprecedented agreement that would allow Schiavo's parents to petition
the federal courts to have a feeding tube replaced for their
brain-damaged daughter.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which involves emergency weekend sessions of both
the House and Senate, marks the first time Congress has intervened
directly in an individual right-to-die case.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came in dramatic fashion, trumpeted by
conservative Republican leaders who persuaded Democrats to agree to
the measure as long as it pertained only to the 41-year-old Florida
woman and did not open the way for moving other such emotionally
charged cases into the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
The White House announced Saturday night that President Bush would
fly to Washington from his Texas ranch Sunday to sign the emergency
legislation. Press secretary Scott McClellan said the president was
standing with ``all those'' working to save Schiavo's life.
</P>
<P>
Outside the nursing facility in Florida where Schiavo is being
cared for, her mother had pleaded earlier Saturday for lawmakers and
the president to intervene. ``Please, please, please save my little
girl,'' said Mary Schindler. A vigil was kept at the facility in
Pinellas Park; three people were arrested when they tried to enter the
hospice.
</P>
<P>
Schiavo's husband, Michael, who has fought to have her feeding tube
removed, said Congress was ``getting into something they know nothing
about.''
</P>
<P>
``And it's sad,'' he said. ``If they can do it to me, they can do
it to everyone in this country.''
</P>
<P>
Terri Schiavo's case has become a cause celebre for evangelical
Christians, who have opposed efforts by her husband to end the medical
measures that have kept her alive for the past 15 years. Schiavo
suffered severe neurological damage as a result of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Schiavo's case, which raises difficult issues of assisted suicide
and right to life, has been championed by conservatives and
evangelical Christians, who turned to congressional Republicans for
help after a Florida court ordered the feeding tube removed last
Friday. Democrats kept a low profile on the issue, but some quietly
cooperated with GOP leaders in the back-stage negotiations this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the Democrats agreed to allow the Republicans to move
forward with a series of elaborate and unusual parliamentary maneuvers
ending in action on the narrowly drawn legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Senate, meeting Saturday evening, passed a special adjournment
resolution that opened the way for the House and Senate to meet in
emergency session Sunday and take up legislation allowing federal
courts to consider accepting jurisdiction in the case. Until now, it
has been in the hands of Florida state courts, which have supported
Schiavo's husband.
</P>
<P>
If a federal judge should decide to accept the case, a court order
could be issued to reinstall the feeding tube while the matter was
under consideration.
</P>
<P>
The House is poised to consider the measure Sunday under a
unanimous consent rule. If that fails, it will take up the measure
again at 12:01 a.m. Monday by suspending the House's regular calendar
and voting on the measure by voice acclamation, Republican leaders
said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate would act soon afterward, sending the measure to
President Bush for his signature. The White House has indicated Bush
would sign it.
</P>
<P>
Few members of Congress are likely to be on hand for these votes,
since most have already begun their Easter recess. But in this case,
only a majority of members present and voting is needed for approval.
</P>
<P>
The fast-moving legislative timetable may raise the curtain on an
equally dramatic legal gambit.
</P>
<P>
Schiavo's parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, would presumably to
turn to the U.S. Court for the Middle District of Florida and ask a
federal judge to keep their daughter alive against her husband's
wishes.
</P>
<P>
Assuming they file the petition sometime Monday, Schiavo -- who is
physically incapable of feeding herself or accepting food by mouth --
will already have gone three days without sustenance in the form of
fluids and nutrition. Medical experts say a human being generally can
live only about seven days without fluids.
</P>
<P>
Give the high emotions aroused by the case, any legal action by the
parents in federal court almost certainly would be challenged by
Michael Schiavo. The result could be legal skirmishes and appeals
eventually reaching all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
But the congressional action alone marked a clear victory for
Schiavo's parents, as well as for their supporters, religious groups
and the conservative wing of the Republican majority in Congress. It
turned what had been a largely local and personal struggle over one
woman's right to live or die into a high-stakes Washington political
issue with highly charged religious and moral overtones.
</P>
<P>
``We are confident this compromise addresses everyone's concerns,''
said House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who has taken the lead
in championing the parents' cause.
</P>
<P>
``We are confident it will provide Mrs. Schiavo a clear and
appropriate avenue for appeal in federal court, and most importantly,
we are confident this compromise will restore nutrition and hydration
to Mrs. Schiavo as long as that appeal endures.''
</P>
<P>
Democratic Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota worked with his
Republican counterparts in putting together the measure titled:
``Relief of the Parents of Theresa Marie Schiavo.'' He encouraged his
Democratic colleagues to approve the bill because it is ``carefully
crafted and narrowly targeted'' for the sole use of Schiavo's father
and mother.
</P>
<P>
``The legislation does no harm,'' he said, ``while the longer term
legal matter is resolved.''
</P>
<P>
Not all Democrats saw it that way. Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., said
it was ``unconscionable that Congress has decided to continue to
intercede.''
</P>
<P>
He added that he will object to the unanimous consent proposal in
the House on Sunday, which could delay action until just after
midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
Schiavo's husband has pursued the effort to end his wife's life
because, he has said, while she left no written, living will, she had
made it clear to him before the heart attack occurred that she would
never want to be kept alive in such a dire medical condition.
</P>
<P>
Her parents have fought tirelessly to keep her on life support,
even to the point of asking her husband to relinquish to them his
position as her legal guardian since he has become involved with
another woman and has fathered children of his own.
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation says that the Middle District of Florida
``shall have jurisdiction to hear, determine and render judgment'' on
a petition from the parents ``relating to the withholding or
withdrawal of food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain
(Terri Schiavo's) life.''
</P>
<P>
It adds that ``any parent of Theresa Marie Schiavo shall have
standing to bring a suit under this act'' into the federal courts. It
also makes clear that ``nothing in this act shall constitute a
precedent with respect to future legislation'' and that it shall have
``no effect'' on other families faced with assisted suicide
situations.
</P>
<P>
DeLay, in announcing the compromise, stressed that the clock is
Terri Schiavo's greatest enemy.
</P>
<P>
``The longer we wait, the worse dehydrated she will get,'' he said.
``Most people need to understand she will not die of starvation. She
will die of dehydration, and that takes no more than seven days and
the longer you go without fluids, the more possible that infections
set in.
</P>
<P>
''And once infections set in it will spread throughout the body
like wildfire. I've had doctors tell me that. That's why we're
expediting this as fast as we can do it so we can get that feeding
tube back in.``
</P>
<P>
DeLay, who for days has been personally chastising Michael Schiavo,
did not spare him on Saturday either. ''I don't have a whole lot of
respect for a man that has treated this woman in this way,`` he said.
''What kind of man is he?``
</P>
<P>
Michael Schiavo said he felt like the government had just trampled
all over his personal life. ''It's just incomprehensible that a
government can walk all over somebody's private judicial matter
because of their own personal feelings,`` Schiavo said on CNN's
''Larry King Live.``

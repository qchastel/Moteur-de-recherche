<P>
In one of the fiercest life-
and-death battles in the United States, the state House in Florida
passed a bill Thursday to extend life support for a brain-damaged 
woman.
</P>
<P>
The bill would block the removal of the feeding tube that has 
kept Terri Schiavo, 41, alive for the past 15 years. A Florida 
appeals court has authorized the removal, which is scheduled on 
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Schiavo's husband and legal guardian Michael Schiavo has 
engaged in a seven-year court battle with her parents. Schiavo has
urged the removal of the feeding tube, saying his wife would 
rather die in her condition, and her parents insisted that Schiavo
be kept alive.
</P>
<P>
Some doctors have testified that Terri Schiavo is in a 
persistent vegetative state, after a sudden heart attack, with no 
hope for recovery, but Schiavo's parents would not give up any 
signs of hope.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time the Florida legislature acted over the
fate of Schiavo. In October 2003, Florida Governor Jeb Bush 
invoked a law rushed through the state legislature to overrule a 
court ruling authorizing the removal of the life support for 
Schiavo. But the Florida Supreme Court ruled later that his rule 
was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The US House of Representatives passed legislation late 
Wednesday that would allow such a case to be moved to federal 
courts, which have twice turned down Schiavo's request to 
intervene. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, Republican from 
Tennessee on Thursday urged the Senate to pass a more limited 
version of the legislation to save Schiavo.

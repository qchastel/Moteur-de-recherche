Supreme Court rejects appeal on behalf of brain-dead Florida woman

<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court refused on Monday to step in and keep a severely
brain-damaged woman hooked to a feeding tube, all but ending a long-running
right-to-die battle pitting her husband against her parents.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time the Supreme Court dodged the politically charged case
from Florida, where Republican Gov. Jeb Bush successfully lobbied the
Legislature to pass a law to keep 41-year-old Terri Schiavo on life
support.
</P>
<P>
The decision was criticized as "judicial homicide" by Mrs. Schiavo's father,
Robert Schindler, but applauded by her husband, Michael Schiavo, who contends
his wife never wanted to be kept alive artificially.
</P>
<P>
The court's action is very narrow, affecting only Schiavo.
</P>
<P>
More broadly, sometime after returning from their winter break, the justices
will consider the Bush administration's request to block the nation's only law
allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients die more quickly. Oregon voters
passed that law in 1998, and more states could follow if justices find that the
federal government cannot punish doctors who prescribed lethal doses of
federally controlled drugs.
</P>
<P>
Terri Schiavo was 26 when she suffered brain damage in 1990 after her heart
temporarily stopped beating because of an eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
Most of the legal wrangling in the case has involved whether she is in a
persistent vegetative state with no chance of recovery and whether her husband
has a conflict of interest because he lives with another woman and has two
children with her.
</P>
<P>
The legal battle between Mrs. Schiavo's husband and parents began in 1993 and
appeared to reach its climax in 2003 when Michael Schiavo won a court decision
ordering that the feeding tube be removed. But it was reinserted six days later,
after the Legislature passed "Terri's Law."
</P>
<P>
The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the law was an unconstitutional effort to
override court rulings. The nation's high court refused without comment to
disturb that decision.
</P>
<P>
"It's judicial homicide. They want to murder her," Schindler said. "I have no
idea what the next step will be. We're going to fight for her as much as we can
fight for her. She deserves a chance."
</P>
<P>
George Felos, the attorney for Michael Schiavo, said his client will have his
wife's feeding tube removed as soon as pending appeals are over and a stay is
lifted.
</P>
<P>
"You've got to look at it from his perspective _ he's a citizen living in
Clearwater (Florida) and up against the weight of the governor and Legislature
of the state of Florida _ a governor whose brother is president of the United
States. That was a very, very difficult and imposing fight. He was very relieved
that the rule of law prevailed," Felos said.

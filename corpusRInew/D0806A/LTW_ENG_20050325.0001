Supreme Court Turns Aside Schiavo Case

<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday turned
aside the case of Terri Schiavo, dimming her parents' hope of saving
her, while religious activists made a final appeal to Florida Gov. Jeb
Bush to defy the courts and intervene.
</P>
<P>
``I can't go beyond what my (legal) powers are, and I'm not going
to,'' said a frustrated Bush, who expressed sympathy for Schiavo's
family.
</P>
<P>
Terri Schiavo's condition deteriorated visibly seven days after her
feeding tube was removed by court order. Death was expected within a
few days.
</P>
<P>
Mary Schindler visited her daughter early Thursday and left in
tears. Terri ``looked like she just got out of Auschwitz,''
anti-abortion activist Randall Terry said Schiavo's sister told him.
</P>
<P>
George J. Felos, the lawyer for Terri's husband, said Michael
Schiavo was saddened by the protracted legal maneuvering but ``very
grateful'' for Thursday's court action.
</P>
<P>
The tone of resignation from Bush sparked anger and disappointment
among protesters standing vigil outside the hospice where Schiavo was
being cared for. Terry, who has been advising the Schindlers, said
``there will be hell to pay'' if the politicians whom religious
conservatives had helped elect let Schiavo die.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court did not explain its decision to turn aside the
right-to-die case, just as it had done in four previous appeals. None
of the justices registered a dissent.
</P>
<P>
That action was followed by rulings Thursday from Pinellas County
Circuit Judge George W. Greer, who barred the state from attempting to
take custody of Schiavo, 41, and reaffirmed that she would not want to
be kept alive through artificial means.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, a potassium imbalance brought on by an eating disorder
caused Schiavo to have a heart attack, which cut off oxygen to her
brain. She has been in what doctors say is a persistent vegetative
state ever since. Schiavo can breathe on her own but cannot eat or
drink.
</P>
<P>
For seven years, Schiavo's husband and parents, Bob and Mary
Schindler, have waged a court battle over her care.
</P>
<P>
The Schindlers maintain that her condition could improve with
therapy.
</P>
<P>
But in 2000, Greer sided with Michael Schiavo and issued his first
order to remove Terri's feeding tube. In the years since, the tube has
been removed and reinserted twice, following court challenges.
</P>
<P>
Greer on Thursday issued a detailed account of why he felt his
original finding remained valid. He said no treatment breakthroughs
had occurred that would offer Schiavo any quality-of-life
improvements.
</P>
<P>
The state immediately appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which
refused to overrule Greer.
</P>
<P>
Outside the Woodside Hospice, about 100 protesters prayed for
Schiavo's rescue as the Schindlers and their lawyers made another
desperate plea to a federal district court judge for intervention. As
of Thursday evening, U.S. District Judge James D. Whittemore had yet
to rule.
</P>
<P>
While the day's legal arguments were being made, the dying woman's
sister and brother made short visits to her room.
</P>
<P>
``It's very frustrating,'' Bobby Schindler said as he shuttled
between the hospice and a thrift shop across the street, where his
family has taken refuge to avoid Michael Schiavo. ``Every minute that
goes by is a minute that Terri is being starved and dehydrated to
death.''
</P>
<P>
Bush, the president's brother, had petitioned Greer to allow the
Florida Department of Children and Families to take protective custody
of Schiavo. On Wednesday, he cited an affidavit from a Florida
neurologist who contended that Schiavo might have been misdiagnosed as
being in a persistent vegetative state instead of a ``minimally
conscious'' one.
</P>
<P>
But Greer disagreed, saying again Thursday that ``by clear and
convincing evidence, it was determined (Schiavo) did not want to live
under such burdensome conditions and that she would refuse such
medical treatment/assistance.''
</P>
<P>
The drama surrounding Schiavo has played out against a political
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress last weekend interrupted its spring recess to
push through a law that allowed the Schindlers to take their case
through the federal court system after they had exhausted all avenues
in the state courts. President Bush rushed back to the White House
from his Texas ranch to sign the legislation in the predawn hours
Monday.
</P>
<P>
But polls show that about two-thirds of Americans say the
government should stay out of such personal matters as end-of-life
decisions.
</P>
<P>
The protesters outside the Woodside Hospice on Thursday appealed to
Gov. Bush to disregard the rulings of more than two dozen state and
federal judges over the past seven years and take custody of Schiavo
by force.
</P>
<P>
``There's a constitutional crisis looming in the state of
Florida,'' said the Rev. Pat Mahoney of the Washington-based Christian
Defense Coalition. ``The question is, will Gov. Bush allow a district
court judge to tell him how to run his state?''
</P>
<P>
Terry accused the governor and the Department of Children and
Families of raising the Schindlers' hopes of rescuing their daughter,
only to cave in to ``a runaway judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
``The governor,'' said Terry, ``blinked.''
</P>
<P>
By evening, the crowd outside the hospice had grown to about 150.
</P>
<P>
``There seems to be no justice in the justice system forthcoming,''
said Paul Reese, from Carlisle, Pa., as he held up a sign urging
prayers for Schiavo.
</P>
<P>
``It's still the duty of the governor of the state to see that the
laws are upheld,'' Reese said. ``The Constitution of the state of
Florida guarantees the life of all innocent people.''
</P>

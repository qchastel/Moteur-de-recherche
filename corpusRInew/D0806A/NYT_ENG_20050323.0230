FLORIDA SENATE REJECTS MEASURE TO INTERVENE IN SHIAVO CASE

<P>
As expected, Florida lawmakers refused to intervene Wednesday
in the case of severely brain-damaged Terri Schiavo, despite eleventh-hour
lobbying by her brother and mounting pressure from Christian conservatives
and anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
"The Senate spoke, and that's it," said Sen. Daniel Webster, the
Republican who unsuccessfully shepherded a measure to keep the 41-year-old
woman alive.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour emotional debate by nearly half of the Senate's 40
senators included personal anecdotes, readings from Scripture and vociferous objections
by those who voted against the measure and were subsequently
targeted by hate-mail, vitriolic telephone calls and whose offices were
even invaded by irate Schindler family supporters.
</P>
<P>
"I am not pulling the plug on her to take away
her life. No one in this room is. But what
we could do today ... might arguably delay her death,"
said Sen. Rod Smith, (D).
</P>
<P>
Doing so, he said, would be the "cruelest fate."
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing in my view is not to release one's
soul to peace when that person has declared that's what
they want," said Smith, the only gubernatorial candidate with a
vote on the measure.
</P>
<P>
He cast his vote with the majority that voted 21-18 against
Webster's bill Wednesday. Last week, the same 21 voted against
a different version of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Webster began the debate by excoriating the "Republican nine," a bloc
of senators who joined with 12 Democrats to successfully kill
an amendment to the measure last week, and who stuck
together Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Jim King, the Republican who was Senate president when
lawmakers approved "Terri's law" in 2003, defended last week's vote.
</P>
<P>
"We were being asked to make a bill that we had
absolutely no interest in passing at all, ever, better. For
those of us with our view, why would we ever
want to do that?" queried King, who called "Terri's law"
the biggest regret of his lengthy legislative career.
</P>
<P>
The day unfolded as Schiavo's brother, Bobby Schindler, walked the Senate
halls while dozens of protestors lined the walls of the
four-story building where lawmakers' offices are located, kneeling or carrying
signs saying "We are begging for Terri's life."
</P>
<P>
Early on, Schindler's efforts were rebuffed by several senators, some of
whom barricaded themselves inside their offices. One aide asked Senate
security to remove Schindler and his escort, anti-abortion activist Carole
Griffin.
</P>
<P>
Even Schindler once appeared dismayed by the intimidating presence of his
sister's supporters, some of whom traveled from across the nation
to maintain a vigil that shifted from the Capitol to
the governor's mansion to and the hospice where Terri Schiavo
lay.
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid they'll do more harm than good," he whispered to
Griffin.
</P>
<P>
Senators echoed the thought during the debate Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I would have people who refer to themselves
as Christians walk across my door and say some of
the mean things that they've said about people in this
building," said Sen. Larcenia Bullard, (D), a Baptist.
</P>
<P>
Bullard asked the people trying to sway her vote to "stop
playing God and refer back to the Bible."
</P>
<P>
During the senate debate, Bush held a hastily-planned press conference in
his usual press conference room announcing DCF's plans to take
emergency action to "stabilize" Schiavo. Pinellas Circuit Judge George Greer
later issued an injunction keeping DCF and the Florida Department
of Law Enforcement away from Schiavo.
</P>
<P>
Senator Dennis Jones, (R), said Bush's push to get DCF involved
is an abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's illegal," Jones said. "I think the message has
been said. We need to let death with dignity take
its course and quit . . . grandstanding."
</P>
<P>
Several dozen sign-clutching demonstrators organized by Randall Terry, an anti-abortion activist
and founder of Operation Rescue, crashed the press conference. All
but three of the protestors left after a security guard
announced that only credentialed press would be allowed to stay.
The last three retreated after Terry motioned them out of
the room.

<P>
A Florida appeals court Tuesday cleared 
the way for a brain-damaged woman to be taken off her life support, 
but a lower court blocked implementation of the decision pending a 
further hearing.
</P>
<P>
The decisions were the latest in a lenghty legal battle between 
Terri Schiavo's husband, who wants to remove the feeding tube that 
has been keeping the 41-year-old alive for 15 years, and her parents 
who want to prevent what they term "cold-blooded murder."
</P>
<P>
Florida's Second District Court of Appeal on Tuesday formally 
issued the decision that effectively allows Michael Shiavo to have 
the life support tubes removed.
</P>
<P>
But Pinellas County Judge George Greer immediately suspended 
enforcement of the decision until Wednesday, when he is due to 
consider a request to extend a previously imposed stay.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have said that Schiavo has been in a persistent 
vegetative state for the last 15 years after suffering a heart 
attack and has no hope of recovering.
</P>
<P>
But her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler say she could recover if 
given the proper treatment. They are backed by Florida Governor Jeb 
Bush, a brother of the US President.

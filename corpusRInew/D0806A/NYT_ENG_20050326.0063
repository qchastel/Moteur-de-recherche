IN FLORIDA, LATEST APPEAL IN SCHIAVO CASE IS REJECTED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PINELLAS PARK, Fla.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judge George Greer of Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court,
who nine days ago ordered the removal of the feeding
tube keeping Terri Schiavo alive, on Saturday again rejected a
motion from her parents seeking to have the tube reinserted.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, said that they
would appeal Greer's decision to the Florida Supreme Court, but
would not pursue the case in federal courts. They said
they would also continue pressing political leaders, including President Bush
and Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, to intervene further in
the case.
</P>
<P>
But time, they said, had all but run out.
</P>
<P>
"She does not want to die," Robert Schindler said after a
late-morning visit to his daughter's bedside. "She is fighting like
hell to stay alive. I want the powers that be
to know that it is not too late to save
her."
</P>
<P>
Gov. Bush, who has become a particular target of the protesters'
scorn in recent days, has said that he has done
all he can under the law. Advisers to the family
were openly hostile to him on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Gov. Bush has stopped taking our calls," said Randall Terry, a
longtime anti-abortion activist and an adviser to the Schindlers. "But
we have not given up hope for a miracle."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, protesters maintained their vigil outside the Woodside Hospice House where,
in a room deep inside the complex, Schiavo edged closer
to death. The crowds were slightly smaller on Saturday than
they had been earlier in the week, but the passions
remained high.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Schindlers argued in their motion filed late Friday
before Greer that they had new evidence that Schiavo was
more able to communicate than had previously been supposed, pointing
to a meeting they said occurred on March 18 between
the stricken woman and one of the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
At that time, they said, Schiavo made two vowel sounds, "Ahhh"
and "Waaa," in response to a questioner who asked if
she wanted to live. They interpreted the sounds as an
effort to say that she did indeed want to live.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Michael Schiavo, her husband, argued that it was already
known that Terri Schiavo responded to some stimulations by making
sounds, but the court had already ruled that this was
merely a reflex, not an effort at communication.
</P>
<P>
In his tersely worded ruling, issued shortly after noon, Greer noted
that the lawyers had waited a full week to mention
the response to the courts, even though they had also
appeared before an emergency hearing in federal court earlier in
the week. By failing to mention the incident at that
earlier hearing, he ruled, they had given up the right
to bring it up at all.

Suspected rebels detonated a bomb inside the home of peasant family
in southwest Colombia early Friday, killing a 19-year-old man, police
said.
</P>
<P>
The victim's mother, who was also in the house, escaped unhurt from
the attack in the village of Santander de Quilchao, 340 kilometers
(210 miles) southwest of Bogota, said police Col. Mario Florez.
</P>
<P>
Florez said he suspects Colombia's largest rebel group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, was behind the
attack because the bomb was of the kind the group typically uses.
</P>
<P>
Florez said there was no apparent motive for the attack.
</P>
<P>
"It really doesn't make sense at this point. Why would the FARC bomb
the home of this peasant family?" he said.
</P>
<P>
The FARC and another smaller rebel group have been fighting the
government for 40 years in a conflict that claims more than 3,000
mostly civilian lives a year.

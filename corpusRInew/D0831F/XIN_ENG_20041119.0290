The office of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Colombia
Friday urged the Colombian government to speed up proposals leading
to the release of hostages kept by guerrilla forces.
</P>
<P>
Michael Fruhling, the office director, told the press it is
indispensable to have a humanitarian agreement between the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the government to
release the hostages including politicians, three US citizens, and
members of the military. Some of them have been in the hands of
rebels for six years.
</P>
<P>
FARC, the country's largest rebel organization, intended to swap
these hostages for 500 imprisoned rebels.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded setting up two demilitarized zones in the south for
the prisoner swap.
</P>
<P>
The government rejected FARC's request but announced last month
releasing 50 jailed guerrillas as the first step to build confidence.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government insisted any rebels freed in the exchange
be exiled from Colombia or enter a government program to
reincorporate them into civilian life.
</P>
<P>
FARC, established in the 1960s, has about 17,000 members at present.
It has been in a warring state with the government since their
cease-fire negotiations failed in February 2002.

The leadership of Colombia's main leftist rebel army, the FARC, has
ordered its troops to try to kill Presidsent Alvaro Uribe, Defense
Minister Jorge Alberto Uribe said late Wednesday.

<P>
"There is information from multiple sources indicating that the FARC
(Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) not only have the plan they
have had since the president opted to seek office, but also have
ordered its units to push hard to try to kill him," the minister told
reporters.

<P>
"The order is specific and comes from multiple sources, It is an
instruction that has come from the FARC leadership. It would be
another attempted strike, let's hope it never goes further than
that," the defense chief added.

In June police said they broke up a series of planned attacks during
a visit by Uribe to the city of Cali.

The president, when on the campaign trail, narrowly escaped a FARC
attempt on his life April 14, 2002 in the port city of Barranquilla
when a bomb went off just as his armored car passed.

Alvaro Uribe, who has been president since August 7, 2002, is
pursuing an aggressive strategy against armed irregulars with his
Patriot Plan, the biggest military offensive in four decades against
the Marxist FARC.

With some 17,000 troops, the FARC is the largest and longest fighting
rebel force in the Americas.

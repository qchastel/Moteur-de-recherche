<TEXT>
<P>
Colombia's Supreme Court of Justice on Wednesday approved the
extradition of two paramilitary leaders and one rebel FARC chief to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Washington had requested their extradition to face narco-trafficking
and money laundering charges in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the US request for paramilitary leaders
Salvatore Mancuso and Carlos Castano -- who mysteriously disappeared
in April -- as well as rebel chief "Simon Trinidad" of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia "complied with Colombian
legislation."
</P>
<P>
Mancuso became the top paramilitary leader in Colombia after
Castano's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader known as "Simon Trinidad" is locked up in a
maximum-security prison, making him the seniormost FARC leader
captured by Colombian authorities.

The United States on Wednesday warned US citizens of a possible spike
in "terrorist activity" in Colombia in the coming week as the
left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) mark the
one-year anniversary of the death of one of their commanders.
</P>
<P>
The State Department, through the US embassy in Bogota, urged
Americans in Colombia to boost their security precautions ahead of
the October 19 anniversary of the death of Edgar Gustavo Navarro,
believed to have been responsible for the taking of three US hostages
in February 2003.
</P>
<P>
"The embassy wishes to inform American citizens throughout Colombia
of the possibility of increased terrorist activity in connection with
the upcoming October 19 Anniversary of a FARC leader's death," it
said.
</P>
<P>
"Americans are urged to maintain a heightened level of vigilance and
to continue practicing good security measures during this time," it
said in a notice to US citizens, a copy of which was provided to AFP
in Washington by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
Navarro, who was killed in combat last year, is thought by Colombian
authorities to have been behind the abduction of the three Americans
-- Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes and Keith Stansell -- after their
anti-drug flight crashed in a FARC stronghold in the Colombian
Amazon.
</P>
<P>
The trio remain in captivity despite a five-million-dollar US reward
for information leading to their release and an August offer from
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe to swap 50 imprisoned rebels for
their freedom along with that of 22 politicians and 34 soldiers and
police officers held by the FARC.
</P>
<P>
The FARC with about 17,000 fighters and a smaller leftist guerrilla
group, the National Liberation Army (ELN) with some 6,000 members,
have been locked in a 40-year civil war against the Colombian
government. The conflict has claimed more than 200,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Both groups, along with the right-wing paramilitary United Self
Defense Force of Colombia (AUC), are designated "foreign terrorist
organizations" by the United States and subject to US sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Uribe has appealed for more international support in his country's
war against the rebels. The United States is a major donor to his
efforts, having given Colombia 3.3 billion dollars in aid since 2000.

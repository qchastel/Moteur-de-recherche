Colombian government ready to meet with rebels on prisoner exchange,
but wants some hostages released first
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colombia's hardline government said Friday it is willing to meet with
members of the country's main leftist rebel group in an unprecedented
offer aimed at freeing dozens of rebel hostages, including three
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Before any face-to-face meeting can take place, however, the rebels
must agree to swap 15 hostages for 15 rebels jailed on minor charges,
said Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
Despite mistrust on both sides, Restrepo said the government is
willing to release the 15 jailed rebels first, provided the rebel
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, at least expresses a
willingness to reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
"All we're looking for is a minimum sign of hope and we will start
the ball rolling," Restrepo told local radio.
</P>
<P>
After any initial prisoner exchange, the meeting, which could last up
to five days, would take place in the Vatican's embassy in Bogota or
at another diplomatic mission in the capital, according to the
government proposal, which was first announced Thursday night and
then amplified Friday.
</P>
<P>
The FARC had no immediate response.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for a total of 50 jailed rebels to be freed in
return for about 60 so-called political prisoners the FARC is holding
in jungle hideouts. The FARC's hostages include politicians, police
officers, soldiers and three U.S. contractors whose small plane
crashed in rebel-held territory early last year.
</P>
<P>
Restrepo said the government would allow the Red Cross to escort to
the capital any FARC members taking part in the talks and would
return them home when the talks end, accompanied by the Roman
Catholic Church representatives.
</P>
<P>
Augusto Castro, vice president of the Catholic Church's ruling body
in Colombia, said he hopes the FARC reacts positively to the offer.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal addresses the need to find a solution at a time when
we are all concerned about being on a street with no exits," said
Castro.
</P>
<P>
The previous administration of President Andres Pastrana held
face-to-face peace talks with the FARC for three years inside a safe
haven as large as Switzerland in the jungles and cattle country of
southern Colombia. Those talks collapsed, and the government
rescinded the safe haven, in 2002 after the FARC rebels hijacked an
airliner and kidnapped a senator who was aboard.
</P>
<P>
In their last communique, the FARC on Oct. 20 said it wanted two new
safe havens to be created in southern Colombia in which talks on a
prisoner exchange would be held. The government rejected providing
additional safe havens to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The FARC and a smaller rebel group have been battling a succession of
elected governments in this Andean nation for 40 years.

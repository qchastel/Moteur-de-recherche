The rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) has killed
another indigenous leader, the National Indigenous Organization of
Colombia (ONIC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pervis Pacheco, leader of the Kankuamo Indians, was killed in Urumita
municipality, south of La Guajira department after he had fled his
community under threat from the FARC, the ONIC said.
</P>
<P>
Pacheco is the fourth indigenous leader murdered in less than a week
in Colombia.

<P>
On Tuesday, the FARC, the largest rebel organization in the country
with up to 20,000 combatants, killed the Yanacona Indian leader
Plinio Piamba and his son.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the rebel group was believed to be responsible for the
death of 70-year-old Mariano Suarez, the top civil and spiritual
leader of the Arhuaca Indians.
</P>
<P>
ONIC, which gathers some 800,000 Indians in Colombia, condemned the
killing and asked non-governmental organizations in Colombia and
abroad for intervention.
</P>
<P>
The Office of the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner condemned
the murder of Suarez and demanded the FARC respect the rights of the
indigenous communities and international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been plagued by a four-decade civil war, in which
leftist rebels, far-right paramilitaries and government troops fight
each other, killing about 3,500 people every year.

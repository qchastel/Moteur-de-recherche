Super fast spacecraft zooms toward Pluto on decade-long mission

The fastest spacecraft ever launched began the first full day of its 3-billion
mile journey to Pluto, where it will study the last unexplored planet and the
mysterious icy area that surrounds it.
</P>
<P>
The New Horizons spacecraft blasted off aboard an Atlas V rocket Thursday
afternoon in a spectacular start to the US$700 million mission. Despite the
speed _ it can reach 36,000 mph (58,000 kph) _ it will take 9 1/2 years to reach
Pluto and the frozen, sunless reaches of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
"It looked beautiful," said Ralph McNutt Jr. of the Johns Hopkins University
Applied Physics Laboratory, one of the mission's scientists. "I was getting a
little bit antsy."
</P>
<P>
The 1,054-pound (480-kilogram) spacecraft was loaded with seven instruments that
will photograph the surfaces of Pluto and its large moon, Charon, and analyze
Pluto's atmosphere. Two of the cameras, Alice and Ralph, are named for the
bickering couple from TV's "The Honeymooners."
</P>
<P>
New Horizons also contained some of the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer
who discovered Pluto in 1930. His widow, Patricia Tombaugh, was in tears as she
watched the launch.
</P>
<P>
"It was so beautiful and we've waited so long," said Tombaugh, 93, of Las
Cruces, New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
NASA had postponed the liftoff two straight days because of wind gusts at the
launch pad and a power outage at the spacecraft's control center in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Pluto is the solar system's most distant planet and the brightest body in a zone
known as the Kuiper Belt, which is made up of thousands of icy, rocky objects,
including tiny planets whose development was stunted for unknown
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe studying those "planetary embryos" can help them understand
how planets were formed.
</P>
<P>
Some astronomers question whether Pluto is technically a planet. Pluto is a
celestial oddball _ an icy dwarf unlike the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus,
Earth and Mars and the gaseous planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune.
</P>
<P>
"We're realizing just how much there is to the deep, outer solar system," said
Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator. "I think it's exciting that
textbooks have to be rewritten, over and over."
</P>
<P>
Because it was launched in January, the spacecraft will be able to use Jupiter's
gravity as a sling to shave five years off the trip, allowing it to arrive as
early as July 2015.
</P>
<P>
The probe, powered by 24 pounds (11 kilograms) of plutonium, will not land on
Pluto but will photograph it, analyze its atmosphere and send data back across
the solar system to Earth.
</P>
<P>
The launch went off without incident, to the relief of anti-nuclear activists
who had feared an accident could scatter lethal radioactive material.
</P>
<P>
The probe will rely on the natural decay of the plutonium to generate
electricity for its instruments. NASA and the Energy Department had put the
chances of a launch accident that could release radiation at 1 in 350. As a
precaution, the agencies brought in 16 mobile field teams that can detect
radiation and 33 air samplers and monitors.
</P>
<P>
NASA administrator Michael Griffin said he had an answer for those who may
question spending so much on the mission to a place in space too far away to
observe in any detail from Earth.
</P>
<P>
"Of what value do you think it might be to be able to study the primordial
constituents from which the solar system and all the planets and we, ourselves,
were formed?" Griffin said.

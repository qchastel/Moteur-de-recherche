IS A NEW PLANET IN THE STARS? ASTROLOGERS RECHECK THE CHARTS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the not-too-distant future, maps of the solar system may be
redrawn to add another planet -- or perhaps take one
away. Last month, when scientists announced the discovery of a
possible 10th planet, some 9 billion miles from the sun,
they reignited a long-running debate about what a true planet
is.
</P>
<P>
They are grappling with whether the newly found celestial body, known
for now as 2003 UB313, should be granted planetary status,
and if it is not, whether Pluto, a like-size ice
ball in a far orbit of the sun, should be
stripped of the title.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers are afire over the shake-up, and their musings have been
lighting up the news media. But they aren't the only
ones excited about the discovery. Their mystical cousins, astrologers, have
also been jolted; they are speculating about what it might
mean for their cosmic readings and prophecies. After all, they,
too, are students of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
Astrologers often employ the maxim "as above, so below." Now suddenly
that which is "above" may be radically changed.
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting," said Richard Brown, an astrologer from Toronto. "I'm immediately
on the Internet, and I'm just jumping up and down."
</P>
<P>
Michael E. Brown (no relation to Richard), an astronomer and a
member of the team that discovered 2003 UB313, said he
has been peppered with inquiries from astrologers seeking to know
the exact moment he made his observation. Brown, a professor
of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, subsequently
posted the time of discovery on his Web page for
their benefit, he said, because he has always appreciated astrologers'
enthusiasm for the heavens. "The astronomical world frequently sits around
and bickers," he said. "It's nice to see a group
sit around and take pleasure in new discoveries."
</P>
<P>
If 2003 UB313 is a 10th planet, astrologers say it may
have a profound influence over people's lives, and thus on
the forecasts astrologers make. But its potency cannot be discerned
until perhaps several years after the astronomical debate is settled,
when astronomers have had time to chart its orbit. So
astrologers are not inclined to do anything hasty. There will
be no tearing up of charts, no hurriedly penciling in
a new planet and certainly no crossing out of Pluto,
a body that many astrologers hold near and dear.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, astrologers seem to have reached an unspoken consensus
to take a wait-and-see approach. Wait and see if there
is a 10th planet. Then wait and observe its influence
on human life. Astrologers have been searching the sky for
centuries for clues to how the positions of stars and
planets could affect life on Earth. Their celestial observations intrigued
Chaucer, Shakespeare and even Galileo. The profession still thrives, supported
in no small part it seems by people who say
they do not really believe in it, as evidenced by
the enormous popularity of horoscopes in magazines, newspapers and on
the Web. Last year America Online's most popular search term
was "horoscope."
</P>
<P>
A Gallup Poll telephone survey conducted in June found that 25
percent of Americans believe that the position of the stars
and planets can affect people's lives.
</P>
<P>
"We like to think of ourselves as the second-oldest profession," said
Richard Brown, the astrologer.
</P>
<P>
Michael Brown said, "I think of it as entertainment," adding that
his wife reads her horoscope in the newspaper each morning,
though not because she believes the predictions will come true.
</P>
<P>
But to some critics, the discovery of a potential 10th planet
is just more evidence that astrology is humbug. If astrologers
were able to detect the influences of planets on people's
lives accurately, should they not have noticed the influence of
a 10th planet long before astronomers detected it?
</P>
<P>
"You would think astrologers would have noticed after 2,000 years of
making predictions that every 20 years or so things would
get messed up," said Phil Plait, an astronomer at Sonoma
State University, in Rohnert Park, Calif. "And then someone would
say, 'Maybe there's another planet out there."'
</P>
<P>
Astrologists argue that they have never asserted that the known planets
and stars account for every last detail of human life.
"We assume there are going to be other planets," said
Deb McBride, an astrologer in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
Leigh Oswald, an astrologer in London, said unknown forces may determine
when scientists discover new planets. "A planet is discovered when
it's appropriate for humanity to understand it," she said. "In
other words, when we are ready for it."
</P>
<P>
Throughout history, when faced with the addition of a new planet,
many astrologers have duly figured out how to use it
in their calculations. Pluto, the most recently discovered planet, is
so tightly woven into astrological charts, to lose it would
be unthinkable, Oswald said. "It's been observed to have a
huge influence on people's lives."
</P>
<P>
Because Pluto is an outer planet, it operates on a level
that affects humanity as a whole as well as individuals,
astrologers say. (The farther out a planet is, theoretically, the
more global its effects.) Named for the Greek god of
the underworld, Pluto brings about unexpected changes. "It's usually dark,"
McBride said. "It's usually a huge upheaval in someone's life."
That upheaval -- in a person's health, family or career
-- is generally followed by a rebuilding, a resurrection, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Pluto is in Sagittarius right now, which to astrologers means it
is exerting an influence on larger social forces like religions,
ideologies and cultural traditions. "When you put Pluto in a
sign like Sagittarius, you start getting religious wars, differences in
cultures," McBride said.
</P>
<P>
Astrologers are especially eager to learn 2003 UB313's permanent name, because
in their business, a celestial object's name is essential to
its interpretation. "Naming is important, particularly when a name has
a mythological charge to it," said Barry Perlman, a San
Francisco astrologer. "You're connecting it to a lineage of cultural
traditions."
</P>
<P>
Even though a planet's name is chosen by mere mortals, astrologers
do not consider the choice a matter of chance. Rather,
they see it arising from an alignment of unseen forces
that affect the collective human unconscious. They find it no
accident that Pluto, for example, was discovered in 1930, in
the era of the rise of Nazism and the development
of the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
Michael Brown has been informally calling the possible new planet Xena,
after the title character from the cult television series "Xena:
Warrior Princess." (He has given equally playful nicknames to other
planetary bodies he has discovered, including Santa, Easter Bunny and
Flying Dutchman.)
</P>
<P>
The official name of 2003 UB313 has yet to be determined,
however. First, the International Astronomical Union, which has the last
word in naming celestial objects, has to decide if it
is a planet, something that is unlikely to happen before
2006, Brown said. He would not reveal the name his
team has nominated, but allowed that it is neither Xena
nor the name of any Greek or Roman god.
</P>
<P>
With or without a new planet, some astrologers say they already
have plenty to study, because they believe that celestial bodies,
from the moon to the billions of stars, can be
incorporated into readings. "There's a whole treasure trove that we
haven't used," said John Cook, an astrologer from New York
City.
</P>
<P>
Like many astrologers, Cook is fascinated by the work of astronomers,
but he knows the feeling is rarely mutual. "Every time
people meet an astronomer, they ask them what their sun
sign is, and they hate that," Cook said with a
chuckle.
</P>
<P>
But Michael Brown, a Gemini, doesn't mind. "I'm happy that they're
thinking about the solar system," he said, "even if I
don't agree."

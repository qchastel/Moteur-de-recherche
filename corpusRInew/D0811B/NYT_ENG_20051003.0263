ESSAY: WHAT'S A PLANET, ANYWAY?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In my daughter's circle of friends, one 3-year-old named Jared can
reel off the names of all the planets. He and
his parents are pretty proud, justly in my estimation, of
this achievement. Little does he know, however, that the lords
of astronomy are working against him.
</P>
<P>
For the last 18 months, a committee appointed by the International
Astronomical Union has been pondering in frustrating exactitude whether the
word "planet" means anything anymore.
</P>
<P>
Last month Nature reported that the committee was ready to propose
dumping the bare term "planet" in favor of an expanded,
more embellished set of terms like "terrestrial planets," "trans-Neptunian planets"
and so forth.
</P>
<P>
But that turned out to be a false alarm, according to
the committee's chairman, Iwan Williams of Queen Mary College in
London. He said in an e-mail message that although a
majority favored the redefinition, many other ideas were blooming and
contending so fractiously that he despaired of ever reaching general
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Williams said, "Up to this point I have been hoping for
a consensus, but I guess we might need to go
for a majority vote."
</P>
<P>
The solar system is much more complicated now, astronomers say, than
in 1930, when Clyde Tombaugh added Pluto to the inventory
of wandering lights circling the sun. In addition to Earth,
Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Neptune, Uranus and Pluto, schoolchildren
now learn that there are also comets and asteroids bumping
about in the night.
</P>
<P>
But there are also the Oort cloud, a hypothesized halo of
cometary bits hibernating in deep, deep space, and the Kuiper
Belt, a ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. Not
mention the dozens of moons circling the planets.
</P>
<P>
Pluto is the big problem. Is it a planet or not?
Some astronomers have long argued that its small size, less
than one-fifth the diameter of Earth, and a weird tilted
orbit that takes it inside Neptune every couple of hundred
years make Pluto more like a Kuiper Belt body than
a full-fledged planet.
</P>
<P>
A furor arose five years ago when my colleague Kenneth Chang
reported that the new Rose Center for Earth and Space
at the American Museum of Natural History in New York
had demoted Pluto, calling it a "Kuiper Belt object" rather
than a planet.
</P>
<P>
The controversy became more desperate this summer when astronomers discovered a
new object larger than Pluto orbiting in the Kuiper Belt
at a distance of 9 billion miles from the sun.
Michael E. Brown of the California Institute of Technology, its
discoverer, has said it will be fine with him if
Pluto is demoted to a minor planet, but, he argues,
if Pluto is a planet, so is the new object,
which he nicknamed Xena, making it the 10th planet. Last
Friday Brown announced that Xena has a tiny moon, making
it seem even more planetlike.
</P>
<P>
Brian Marsden, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, directs
the astronomical union's Minor Planet Center, a clearinghouse for solar
system discoveries. Marsden says he thinks that both Pluto and
Brown's Xena should be called minor planets. He is one
of those who support the idea of categorizing planets into
groups.
</P>
<P>
But according to Williams, other members of the panel have championed
other ideas. For example, some say that planets should be
larger than 2,000 kilometers (or about 1,250 miles) in diameter
(Pluto's diameter is about 1,500 miles). Neil DeGrasse Tyson, of
the Rose Center, who is not a member of the
astronomical union committee, said the proposed naming scheme sounded a
lot like the museum's system. He said, however, that the
need to assign adjectives to the word "planet" might mean
it was time to retire the term altogether.
</P>
<P>
Asked what he would replace it with, Tyson said he hoped
the geologists could come up with something and offered up
words like "terrestrials," for balls of dirt and rock like
Earth; "Jovians," for giant gaseous planets like Jupiter and Saturn;
comets; and so forth.
</P>
<P>
The panel members disagree on more than just the definition of
a planet. At last report they could not even agree,
it seemed, on whether they were making progress. Within the
space of a few minutes the other week, I received
one e-mail message from Marsden saying he was optimistic and
another from Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington
complaining that his morning e-mail gave him no sense that
they were near bringing the issue to a close.
</P>
<P>
In another e-mail message, Boss described the process as "like trying
to shovel frogs into a wheelbarrow -- they keep jumping
out again."
</P>
<P>
The new object, now known poetically as 2003 UB313, is destined
to languish nameless until the astronomical union panel comes to
a conclusion and thus decides which part of the astronomical
bureaucracy is responsible for major planets or minor planets and
will have to approve a new name.
</P>
<P>
"Every time it looks as though we might be approaching a
consensus, rather severe disagreement has a way of breaking out
again," Marsden said. "It is all very unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
Even the idea that a majority of the committee was leaning
anywhere was hotly disputed by S. Alan Stern of the
Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., who is the principal
investigator of a coming National Aeronautics and Space Administration mission
to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.
</P>
<P>
Stern has suggested that the criterion of planethood be roundness --
a body big enough for gravity to have conquered geological
and mechanical forces. That would include in the roll call
of planets not only Pluto, but dozens of objects he
thinks are yet to be discovered out in the Kuiper
Belt.
</P>
<P>
"I think it'll be obvious very shortly that dwarf planets surely
outnumber the planets our fathers' generation thought of as the
mainstream," Stern said. If it should turn out in the
years to come that Earth is not actually a very
good example of a planet, that would not be the
first instance in which astronomers have painted themselves into a
corner, linguistically.
</P>
<P>
Being limited to looking in the practice of their science, astronomers
tend to characterize and classify new phenomena by their appearances
-- their colors, for example. Objects that resemble one another
then get lumped together under the name of their progenitor
until enough differences accumulate to start a new category.
</P>
<P>
So it was that a starlike object known as BL Lacertae,
the progenitor of a kind of exploding galaxy, was eventually
said to not be a good example of a BL
Lacertae object.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers are not alone in having a silly name problem, but
they may be alone in agonizing so much about it.
Physicists have shown little restraint in creating names like neutrinos,
quarks, squarks, gluons, photinos, selectrons, strangeness and charm, not to
mention strings and branes.
</P>
<P>
No commission regulates what physicists call things. "Basically physicists are too
undisciplined to let anyone else tell us what to name
something," said Gordon Kane of the University of Michigan. "It's
mainly whatever name catches on."
</P>
<P>
Williams of the astronomical union said there was no deadline for
his committee's decision on planetary nomenclature. The urgency, he said,
comes from the need to find a way of giving
Brown's Xena an official name. Early this week Williams circulated
a new proposal, defining anything with a radius of more
than 1,000 kilometers (roughly that of Pluto) as a planet,
asking for a vote within two weeks. So far there
are no indications of a groundswell.
</P>
<P>
Boss, of the Carnegie Institution, who hopes that the adjective-planet compromise
will catch on in astronomy, said he thought the public
would be "thrilled" to realize that astronomy had progressed so
far as to require a re-sorting of the primary components
of the solar system. "Science marches on," he said, "and
this brouhaha is a sterling reminder of both the joy
and the pain of this process."
</P>
<P>
I cannot argue with his logic and his desire for clarity.
But at the risk of being a curmudgeon, and in
the interest of 3-year-olds everywhere who are reaching for a
basic comprehension of how the universe is put together and
where they stand, I think the astronomers should take a
page from the lawyers and jurists we're hearing so much
from these days.
</P>
<P>
I think they should adopt "stare decisis," Latin for "stand by
that decided."
</P>
<P>
By precedent Pluto is a planet. If we agree on that,
then we can look forward to many more planets.
</P>
<P>
There were smiles all around the office here when the putative
10th planet was announced last July. There is something ennobling
and hopeful about living at a time when a 10th
planet is added to the solar system, and maybe an
11th and 12th as planned surveys of the trans-Neptunian void
are carried out. It is like being young again and
finding out your family is larger than you thought.
</P>
<P>
It is like living in an expanding universe.

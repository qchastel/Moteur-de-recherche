'THE PLANETS': NINE FAMILIAR PLANETS, NOW WITH PERSONALITY-PLUS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're so far away, yet somehow so close. The planets make
their appointed rounds at distances measured in millions or billions
of miles, yet their personal magnetism, so to speak, and
the visible presence of beloved orbs like Venus and Mars,
make them feel almost like family -- all part of
the same happy solar system.
</P>
<P>
And what a collection of personalities they turn out to be
in Dava Sobel's warm, whimsical portrait album of the nine
planets, with the moon thrown in for good measure. Sobel,
the author of "Longitude" and "Galileo's Daughter," has aimed "The
Planets" squarely at a mass audience receptive to the romance
of the heavens, ready to have its mind boggled by
weird and wonderful facts, and eager to coo and trill
over verbal baby pictures of peppy little Mercury and seductive
Venus.
</P>
<P>
"The Planets" has a little something for everyone. Myth, poetry, science
fiction, geology, mineralogy, cosmology, and even etymology find their way
into Sobel's almost fablelike narratives, which, if you remove a
few technical terms, could make splendid bedtime read-aloud material. Each
planet has a personality, a face, and a rich inner
life.
</P>
<P>
Sobel excels at evoking the saturated colors, the strange weather, and
the eerie atmosphere of the planets. Gassy Jupiter, with no
solid surface or terrain, is nothing but weather, unchanged by
seasons because the planet sits upright on its axis. "Every
identifiable feature resolves into a cloud bank, a cyclone, a
jet stream, a thunderbolt, or a curtain of auroral lights,"
Sobel writes. "On Jupiter, a storm may continue for centuries,
innocent of landfall."
</P>
<P>
Even Sobel's orbits take on a poetic quality. Mercury races around
the Sun much faster than it spins. It takes six
weeks to get from sunup to high noon, but only
88 days to complete a journey around the sun. "Thus,"
Sobel writes, "the years hurry by, while the days drag
on forever." Among many other things, Mercury is the god
of commerce, reflected in words like "merchant" and "mercantile."
</P>
<P>
"The Planets" is a grab bag of fascinating facts like these.
Because the thick carbon-dioxide clouds that swathe Venus allow only
red light to penetrate, "the landscape presents itself as a
monochrome in the sepia tones of old photographs." Seismologists can
actually hear Earth's iron-nickel core turning inside the still-molten outer
core, at a speed almost one second a day faster
than the rest of the planet. When spring arrives on
Mars, white frost disappears, as if by magic, back into
the carbon-dioxide atmosphere whence it came, without pausing to melt.
</P>
<P>
The gee-whiz factor looms large, in other words. But along the
way Sobel manages to sneak in a coherent account of
how each planet was discovered and named, how it moves
in the solar system, and what puzzles remain for scientists
to solve. She does not shy away from terms like
"magnetosphere" or "regolith." But she makes sure to translate numbers
and physical data into images that seize the imagination.
</P>
<P>
To imagine the almost unimaginable flatness of the rings of Saturn,
whose average depth is roughly equivalent to a 30-story building,
picture a sheet of tissue paper the size of a
football field.
</P>
<P>
Sobel occasionally overplays her hand. She tells the story of Mars
in the first person, assuming the role of Allan Hills
84001, a Martian meteorite discovered near the South Pole in
1984. This is twee. Sobel, in a brief preface recalling
her earliest infatuation with the planets, describes a class play
in which a student twirling two Hula-Hoops played Saturn and
she appeared as the Lonely Planet. The talking Mars rock
belongs in that play.
</P>
<P>
Also annoying is the dual chapter on Uranus and Neptune, which
takes the form of an imaginary letter from Caroline Lucretia
Herschel, the sister of the astronomer William Herschel, to the
American astronomer Maria Mitchell. As an exercise in Victorian prose
style, it rates a B. As a strain on the
reader's patience, it flies right off the charts.
</P>
<P>
What about Pluto, that little scamp at the far end of
the solar system? It's a problem. It achieved planetary status
when astronomers sensed a certain something pulling at Uranus and
Neptune. Originally, it was assumed that Planet X was 10
times Earth's mass. Since being discovered in 1930, Pluto has
had its size downgraded drastically, to the specklike dimensions it
has today, about 1,500 miles in diameter and a mass
only two-thousandths of Earth's. Then, in 1989, Voyager 2 erased
Pluto's reason for being. It found that Neptune and Uranus
actually balanced each other's orbital anomalies, and there was no
need to posit a ninth planet.
</P>
<P>
Sobel comes up with a happy ending. In the 1990s, astronomers
discovered all sorts of Pluto-like bodies in the Kuiper Belt,
a doughnut-shaped zone that extends outward from Neptune to a
distance 50 times greater than the distance from the Earth
to the sun. So things are looking up for Pluto,
which may have its best days ahead of it, not
the last planet, perhaps, but as "the first citizen of
a distant teeming shore."

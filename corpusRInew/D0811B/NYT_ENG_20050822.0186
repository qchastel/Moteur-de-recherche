A SKY WATCHER STAKES HIS CLAIM TO A NEW PLANET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PASADENA, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Between feedings and diaper changes of his newborn
daughter, Michael E. Brown may yet find an 11th planet.
</P>
<P>
Once conducted almost exclusively on cold, lonely nights, observational astronomy these
days is often done under bright California sunshine.
</P>
<P>
When he has a few spare minutes, Brown, a professor of
planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, downloads images
taken during a previous night by a robotically driven telescope
at Palomar Observatory 100 miles away. Each night, the telescope
scans a different swath of sky, photographing each patch three
times, spaced an hour and a half apart.
</P>
<P>
In any one of the photographs, a planet or some other
icy body at the edge of the solar system looks
just like a star. Unlike a star, it moves between
the exposures.
</P>
<P>
Brown's computer programs flag potential discoveries for him to inspect. He
quickly dismisses almost all of them -- double images caused
by a bumping of the telescope, blurriness from whirls in
the atmosphere or random noise.
</P>
<P>
But sometimes, like last Jan. 5, he spots a moving dot.
</P>
<P>
Brown had rewritten his software to look for slower-moving and more
distant objects.
</P>
<P>
On that morning, he was sitting in his Caltech office --
unremarkable university turf sparsely decorated with a not-full bottle of
Jack Daniel's, a dragon mobile, a dinosaur toothbrush, a Mr.
Potato Head and other toys and knickknacks that long predated
parenthood -- and re-examining images from nearly a year and
a half earlier, Oct. 21, 2003.
</P>
<P>
The first several candidates offered by the computer were the usual
garbled images.
</P>
<P>
Then he saw it: a bright, unmistakably round dot moving across
the star field.
</P>
<P>
He did a quick calculation. Even if this new object reflected
100 percent of the sunlight that hit it -- and
nothing is perfectly reflective -- it would still be almost
as large as Pluto.
</P>
<P>
Without any additional data, Brown knew he had discovered what could
be the 10th planet.
</P>
<P>
He noted the time: 11:20 a.m. Brown knew that astrologers would
ask because they had asked for that information after earlier
discoveries of smaller objects in the Kuiper Bel.
</P>
<P>
He thought about a bet he had made with a friend,
for five bottles of champagne, that he would discover something
larger than Pluto by Jan. 1, 2005, a deadline that
had passed five days earlier. He sent her an e-mail
message asking for a five-day extension.
</P>
<P>
Brown seems destined for future astronomy textbooks, either as the discoverer
of the first new planet in 75 years or as
the man who pushed Pluto out of the planetary pantheon.
Astronomers have long argued over whether Pluto should be called
a planet and speculated that ice balls larger than Pluto
might be hiding in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of
debris beyond the orbit of Neptune. Several objects approaching the
size of Pluto have been discovered in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Brown and two colleagues, David Rabinowitz of Yale and Chad Trujillo
of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, were the first to
point to something that is almost certainly larger than Pluto.
</P>
<P>
"If people want to get rid of Pluto, I'm more than
happy to get rid of Pluto and say this one
isn't a planet, either," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
"If culturally we would be willing to accept a scientific definition,
that would be great," he continued. "The only thing that
would make me unhappy is if Pluto remained a planet,
and this one was not one."
</P>
<P>
So far, little is known about the new planet, which carries
the temporary designation of 2003 UB313. It is currently 9
billion miles from the sun, at the farthest point of
its 560-year orbit.
</P>
<P>
A couple of centuries from now, its elliptical trajectory will take
it within 3.3 billion miles of the sun, closer than
portions of Pluto's orbit. And the orbit is surprisingly askew.
While most of the solar system circles the Sun in
a flat plane, the new planet's orbit is tilted about
45 degrees from the plane.
</P>
<P>
Planet finding was not a career goal for Brown. Until recently,
he was among those who argued that nothing in the
Kuiper Belt deserved to be called a planet, not even
Pluto.
</P>
<P>
Brown, 40, grew up in Alabama, a child of the 1970s.
His father, an engineer at IBM, had moved to Huntsville
to work on the giant Saturn rockets, which were being
designed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center to carry astronauts
to the moon.
</P>
<P>
When he was finishing his undergraduate degree in physics at Princeton,
he thought he would pursue theoretical work in cosmology, devising
ideas about how the universe came together.
</P>
<P>
Then James Peebles, a physics professor at Princeton, mentioned to him
how astronomy needed more observers actually looking at the sky.
</P>
<P>
"That was it," Brown recalled. "As soon as he said it,
I was like, OK."
</P>
<P>
In graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, he still
planned to work on the far, far away -- distant
galaxies that blast out loud radio signals. His thesis adviser,
Hyron Spinrad, had his graduate students also work on comets,
because he was interested in them and could not get
help otherwise. Brown was captivated as well. "I thought, this
stuff is cool," he said.
</P>
<P>
That brought his interests inside the solar system. Later, Brown came
across a tiny, little-used 24-inch telescope at the Lick Observatory
outside San Jose, Calif. "You find the telescope first and
then find your thesis program," he said.
</P>
<P>
His thesis topic turned out to be the volcanoes on Io,
one of the moons of Jupiter, and how the gases
from the volcanoes are swept up into Jupiter's magnetic fields,
accelerated into orbit around Jupiter and then slammed back into
Io at 125,000 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
He entered the planet-searching business through a chance opportunity. When he
arrived at Caltech a decade ago, the 48-inch Samuel Oschin
Telescope at Palomar was just finishing up a large sky
survey. While many astronomers clamor to use Palomar's main 200-inch
telescope, Brown realized he could easily get ample time on
the smaller one.
</P>
<P>
So, just as he did at Lick, he looked for a
project to fit the telescope.
</P>
<P>
The first Kuiper Belt object had been discovered a few years
earlier, and Brown thought it would be useful to do
a systematic sweep of the sky to look for others.
In past centuries, the trick to discovering a planet was
knowing exactly where to look. Now, computers and automated telescopes
have allowed a new strategy: look everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Brown has a love of code names, so he and his
colleagues decided that if they ever found something larger than
Pluto, they would give it the code name Xena, after
the television series.
</P>
<P>
It was also partly a nod to Planet X, a long-hypothesized
massive planet in the outer solar system.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, Brown and Trujillo turned up their first big find:
a Kuiper Belt object about 775 miles wide, or about
as large as Pluto's moon, Charon. They named it Quaoar,
after a god in Native American mythology, and learned their
first lesson in astronomical discovery: find a pronounceable name. (Quaoar
is pronounced KWAH-o-wahr.)
</P>
<P>
A year later, Brown, Trujillo and Rabinowitz of Yale found something
stranger, an object larger than Quaoar and much farther out,
8 billion miles. And stranger yet, its 11,000-year orbit carried
it out as far as 84 billion miles, far beyond
anything else known in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
Initially, they excitedly thought it might be larger than Pluto and
called it Xena for a few days. But further measurements
and calculations indicated it was probably no larger than three-quarters
the diameter of Pluto. When they announced the discovery last
year, they gave it the name of Sedna, after an
Inuit goddess.
</P>
<P>
The name was easily pronounceable, but it irritated some astronomers, especially
amateur asteroid searchers, who felt Brown had again flouted the
International Astronomical Union's naming rules. The rules prohibit discoverers from
publicly announcing any name, even a tentative one, before the
union approves it, a process that takes months to years.
The critics wanted the union to rebuke Brown and reject
the name.
</P>
<P>
One amateur astronomer, Reiner M. Stoss, even proposed Sedna as a
name for a small asteroid discovered earlier, to thwart Brown.
</P>
<P>
Brown acknowledged, "I consciously broke the rules," but he felt that
the preliminary designation, 2003 VB12, was too obscure and confusing
for a noteworthy addition to the solar system. "I thought,
this is stupid," he said. "This object needs to have
a name before it goes public."
</P>
<P>
After Sedna, the astronomers also realized that there could be more
discoveries lurking in their photographs.
</P>
<P>
Brown finds that betting is an effective way to spur scientific
progress. He would have found the planet sooner or later,
but late last year he realized that his best hope
for winning the champagne bet was to sift through thousands
of candidates in the old images.
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 20, going through the images from the previous May,
he discovered a new bright Kuiper Belt object.
</P>
<P>
It was big, but not big enough. He gave that one
the code name of Santa.
</P>
<P>
When he later discovered a moon around Santa, he gave the
moon the code name Rudolph. (When he discovered yet another
Kuiper Belt object in April, he continued in the holiday
vein and named that one Easter Bunny. He even had
a code name for his daughter before she was born.
The whiteboard in his office had a list of tasks
labeled "TDBP" -- To Do Before Petunia.)
</P>
<P>
He spent Christmas through New Year's examining old images.
</P>
<P>
Nothing turned up.
</P>
<P>
Then on Jan. 5 -- not Jan. 8 as he had
said at his news conference -- he finally found one
he could call Xena. "What if it's the size of
Mercury?" he mused in his notes.
</P>
<P>
This time, Brown decided to play by the International Astronomical Union's
rules and did not announce his real intended name for
2003 UB313, leading to rumors that he had officially proposed
Xena.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brown, on family leave until the end of year, found
a new set of data to work with: his daughter
Lilah's sleeping and eating patterns.
</P>
<P>
In the hospital, he and his wife had, like many new
parents, written down a record of feeding and sleeping times.
</P>
<P>
Brown wrote a computer program to generate colorful charts from the
information and put them online at lilahbrown.com.
</P>
<P>
"Who wouldn't be fascinated?" Brown asked. "Well, I guess, most people."
</P>
<P>
Black bars indicate the times that his wife, Diane Binney, is
breast-feeding Lilah. Blue bars indicate when Brown is giving her
a bottle. Green bars indicate the hours Lilah is awake
and content; red bars indicate the fussy times.
</P>
<P>
Brown said he hoped to find a pattern in Lilah's sleep
cycle -- she has been waking up, on average, every
2.5 hours. If one nap lasted only 1.5 hours, would
that mean the next nap would last 3.5 hours, giving
her parents a chance to rest?
</P>
<P>
A chart with cloudlike splatter of data points gave the unfortunate
answer. "There is absolutely no correlation," Brown said.

Scientists Discover 2 New Moons Circling Pluto
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have found that
Pluto has not one, but three moons.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is likely to prompt searches for undiscovered moons
elsewhere and shed light on the evolution of the Kuiper Belt, the vast
icy region of space beyond Neptune where Pluto resides.
</P>
<P>
``Pluto just became even more interesting,'' said Hal Weaver, a
planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in
Laurel, Md., and co-leader of the team that made the discovery.
</P>
<P>
The newly discovered moons are constantly being pelted by objects
in space, sending out debris that give Pluto an unusual appearance,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
``They should generate rings around Pluto,'' said Alan Stern, of
the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., the other
co-leader. But so far, no one has seen them.
</P>
<P>
The most distant planet from the sun, Pluto is only about 1,475
miles in diameter, or two-thirds the size of earth's moon -- so tiny
that some scientists question whether it qualifies for planethood at
all.
</P>
<P>
``It tells us that Pluto is a much more complex world than we
previously imagined,'' Richard Binzel, a planetary scientist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of the latest discovery.
``How do you get so many moons around such a small planet?''
</P>
<P>
Moons have been discovered orbiting every planet in the solar
system except Venus and Mercury. Jupiter, by far the largest planet,
has 38 known moons.
</P>
<P>
Like earth's moon, most are believed to have formed when meteors or
other space objects collided with the nearby planet, shooting debris
into space that are gradually shaped by gravitational forces.
</P>
<P>
``It' the easiest way for a planet to get such a huge satellite,''
Binzel said.
</P>
<P>
Training Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys on Pluto on May 15
and again three days later, scientists found two very faint satellites
moving in a counterclockwise orbit. They were about 5,000 times
fainter than light from the planet itself.
</P>
<P>
The new moons are 30 to 100 miles in diameter and orbit about
30,000 miles and 40,000 miles away from Pluto, respectively. The
closer moon takes about 25 days to orbit, the more distant takes about
38 days.
</P>
<P>
Charon, the moon discovered in 1978, is 12,000 miles from Pluto and
orbits the planet once every 6.4 days.
</P>
<P>
The observations were confirmed by Hubble images taken on June 14,
but they must be reconfirmed by the Hubble in February before the
International Astronomical Union will consider names for the moons.
For now, they're known as P1 and P2.
</P>
<P>
Pluto itself was discovered in 1930 and named for the Roman god of
the underworld. Its orbit ranges from 2.7 billion miles to 4.6 billion
miles from the sun. Earth is 93 million miles from the sun.
</P>
<P>
Some astronomers say Pluto's small size, its highly elliptical
orbit and methane ice surface make it more like a Kuiper Belt object
and less like the outer gas giant planets, such as Jupiter and
Neptune.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at New York's Hayden Planetarium caused an uproar when
they put only eight planets in a display that opened in 2000 and
classified Pluto as a Kuiper Belt object. The debate intensified this
summer with discovery of a Kuiper Belt object, UB313, that is larger
than Pluto.
</P>
<P>
But experts say discovery of the moons may help Pluto keep its
planetary status.
</P>
<P>
``It's going to be harder and harder not to call it a planet,''
said Stephen Maran, a retired astronomer from the Goddard Space Flight
Center and author of the book ``Astronomy for Dummies.''

<P>
The IAU has currently assigned a group of astronomers to develop
criteria for planethood.
</P>
<P>
Stern, who is a member of the IAU group, said the discovery of the
moons will likely add support to keeping Pluto a planet. He also is
principal investigator of New Horizons, an unmanned National
Aeronautics and Space Administration mission designed to probe Pluto
and the Kuiper Belt over the next 15 years. Launch is scheduled for
January.
</P>
<P>
``I think just on a visceral level, the fact that Pluto has a whole
suite of companions, I think will make some people, in the public at
least, feel better about its status,'' Stern said.

A US astronomer announced Friday he 
had discovered what could be a 10th planet in the outer reaches of 
the solar system nearly 15 billion kilometers (nine billion miles) 
from earth.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, the discovery by Professor Mike Brown of the 
respected California Institute of Technology would be the first of a 
planet since Pluto was identified in 1930.
</P>
<P>
The body is "the 10th planet of the solar system," said Brown, a 
professor of planetary astronomy in a phone conference from CalTech 
in the town of Pasadena. "It's the farthest object ever discovered 
to orbit around the sun."
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely bigger than Pluto," he said of the body made up 
of ice and rock.
</P>
<P>
The planet is a typical member of the Kuiper belt, but its sheer 
size in relation to the nine known planets means that it can only be 
classified as a planet, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
Currently about 97 times further from the sun than the Earth, 
the planet is the farthest-known object in the solar system, and the 
third brightest of the Kuiper belt objects.
</P>
<P>
But Brown conceded that the discovery would likely rekindle 
debate over the definition of "planet" and whether Pluto should 
still be regarded as one.

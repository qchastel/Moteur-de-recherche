WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (AFP)

<TEXT>
<P>
US lawmakers passed legislation allowing tighter government
regulation of steroid precursors here Monday, one day after the death
of former baseball star Ken Caminiti, an admitted steroid user.
</P>
<P>
The Anabolic Steroid Control Act would add androstenedione,
norandrosterone and similar testosterone-production enhancing
substances to a list of anabolic steroids regarded as controlled
substances.
</P>
<P>
The legislation allows the US Drug Enforcement Agency to regulate
these products as anabolic steroids under the Controlled Substances
Act.
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire admitted taking andro during a record-breaking 70 home
run season in 1998, back when the substance was not banned by the US
baseball league, which only began steroid testing of players this
season.
</P>
<P>
"This important legislation will help us reach our goal of zero
tolerance in the battle against steroids," major league commissioner
Bud Selig said.
</P>
<P>
"This will allow us to test for steroid precursors, just as we are
currently testing for steroids, as part of our regular testing."
</P>
<P>
A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act, toughening penalties
for anabolic steroid offenses near sports facilities, was put forth
on March 1 and passed by the US House of Representatives in June.
</P>
<P>
Caminiti, who played in the major leagues for 15 years, died of an
apparent heart attack Sunday at age 41. He had admitted to using
steroids during his Most Valuable Player season in 1996, when he hit
.326 with 40 homers and 130 runs batted in for the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
As with athletics, baseball has been criticized since the BALCO Labs
steroid scandal broke a year ago.
</P>
<P>
BALCO founder Victor Conte and vice president James Valente,
athletics coach Remi Korchemny and Greg Anderson, the personal
trainer for baseball star Barry Bonds, have all pleaded not guilty to
steroid distribution charges in the case.
</P>
<P>
Grand jury testimony saw many top sports figures testify, including
San Francisco star Bonds and Gary Sheffield and Jason Giambi of the
New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
Drug testing was a key part of the labor deal baseball club owners
signed with players in 2002. After between five and seven percent of
players tested positive in anonymous testing last year, a tougher
testing programme was installed, although global sports officials
have called relatively light penalties by Olympic standards
laughable.

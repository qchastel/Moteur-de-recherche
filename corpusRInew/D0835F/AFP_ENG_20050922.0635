BALTIMORE, Maryland, Sept 22

Major League Baseball star 
Rafael Palmeiro may not be the only Baltimore Oriole in hot water 
after he told an arbitration panel that a teammate provided him with 
an unknown substance.
</P>
<P>
Citing two unnamed sources, the Baltimore Sun reported Thursday 
that Palmeiro told the panel of the substance. But it is still 
unsure if the substance has been linked to his positive steroid 
test.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported last month that Palmeiro tested 
positive for the anabolic steroid stanozolol which is most notably 
linked to the Olympic sprinter Ben Johnson of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Johnson was stripped of his gold medal in 1988 after testing 
positive for that steroid.
</P>
<P>
Palmeiro, one of four players in baseball history with 3,000 
hits and 500 home runs, was suspended for 10 days in August for his 
positive test after his grievance was denied by an arbitration 
panel.
</P>
<P>
A congressional committee is looking into Palmeiro's reported 
claim as part of an investigation into whether he committed perjury 
when he emphatically denied ever using steroids at a hearing before 
Congress in March.
</P>
<P>
After his positive steroid test, Palmeiro told an arbitration 
panel that he never "intentionally" used steroids. However, he could 
not explain how the drugs got into his body.
</P>
<P>
The Orioles sent Palmeiro to his home in Texas earlier this 
month to rehab an injured knee. Palmeiro had gone two-for-26 and 
played under intense scrutiny since returning from his 10-day 
suspension.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Palmeiro is hitting .266 with 18 homers and 60 
RBI in 100 games this season.
</P>
<P>
With 569 homers and 3,020 hits in his 19-year career, Palmeiro 
was believed to be headed for the Hall of Fame. But that was before 
his legacy was soiled by the positive steroid test.

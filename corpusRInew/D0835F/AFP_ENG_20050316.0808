US lawmakers rebuke baseball leaders for weak doping plan

WASHINGTON, March 16

<TEXT>
<P>
US lawmakers ripped into Major 
League Baseball's new drug testing plan, describing it as shamefully 
inadequate on the eve of a Congressional hearing into rampant 
steroid taking by stars.
</P>
<P>
The option of imposing fines rather than mandatory bans for 
steroid offenses raised questions about the quality of MLB's 
anti-doping plan as well as the trustworthiness of leaders to police 
the game.
</P>
<P>
Revealing weak points of the plan, US House of Representatives 
Government Reform Committee chairman Tom Davis and ranking minority 
member Henry Waxman sent an open letter to baseball commissioner Bud 
Selig and union boss Don Fehr.
</P>
<P>
"Our preliminary review raises questions about whether the new 
policy is as comprehensive and effective as ... claimed," Davis and 
Waxman wrote, pointing up numerous weaknesses compared with World 
Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) standards.
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of questions about the discrepancies between 
Major League Baseball's public presentation of its new drug testing 
effort and the language of the new policy. We hope you will come 
prepared to address these questions."
</P>
<P>
Major League Baseball, which presented its plan to lawmakers 
Monday in advance of the hearings, began steroid testing last season 
and unveiled a toughened plan January 13 that Selig said "will 
eradicate steroid use."
</P>
<P>
Despite tough talk, baseball's policy shows possible fines with 
no bans for any steroid offender.
</P>
<P>
First offences were stated as punishable by "a 10-day suspension 
or up to a 10,000-dollar fine" with second offences a 30-day ban or 
25,000-dollar fine, then 60-day ban or 50,000-dollar fine, one-year 
ban or 100,000-dollar fine.
</P>
<P>
"One hundred thousand dollars is less money than some players 
earn in one game," Davis and Waxman noted.
</P>
<P>
The penalty for a fifth violation is at the commissioner's 
discretion.
</P>
<P>
US Senator John McCain ripped Selig and Fehr in a letter for 
misrepresenting the standards of baseball's anti-doping plan and 
hinted that lawmakers were ready to take action if baseball leaders 
would not impose mandatory bans.
</P>
<P>
"I can reach no conclusion but that the league and the players' 
union have misrepresented to me and to the American public the 
substance of MLB's new steroid policy," McCain wrote.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the league and the players' union to modify the new 
policy. To do anything less than that would constitute a violation 
of the public's trust, a blow to the integrity of Major League 
Baseball and an invitation to further scrutiny of the league's 
steroid policy."
</P>
<P>
Steroid offenders who are fined rather than suspended are not 
identified under baseball's plan and even those suspended have no 
mandatory public confirmation the ban was for steroids, results 
being "strictly confidential".
</P>
<P>
Compare that to the two-year public ban for steroid first 
offenders in Olympic sports and lifetime ban thereafter under WADA 
rules and it's easy to see why baseball's plan was eyed with scorn 
and skepticism.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the public assurances of Major League Baseball 
officials, we have questions about the effectiveness of its new drug 
policy," Davis and Waxman wrote.
</P>
<P>
"There appear to be major differences between Major League 
Baseball's new policy and the independent, widely respected testing 
program of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"The Olympic policy appears comprehensive, strict, independent, 
and transparent. Major League Baseball's program appears to raise 
questions on all four counts."
</P>
<P>
The baseball policy excludes four anabolic steroids - boldione, 
danazol, quinbolone and dihydroepiandrostone - that are banned for 
Olympians.
</P>
<P>
"Designer" steroids covered under Olympic doping guidelines are 
not under baseball's plan.
</P>
<P>
"The failure of Major League Baseball to cover designer steroids 
would appear to be a significant omission," Davis and Waxman wrote.
</P>
<P>
"According to experts, hundreds of potential "designer" steroids 
already exist. Major League Baseball is still confronting a major 
scandal cgation is 
launched into drug testing and the league and union "have 
successfully resisted an investigation at the trial court level" 
with the entire program subject to renegotiation if suspended beyond 
a year.
</P>
<P>
"This provision appears designed to discourage responsible 
independent oversight," Davis and Waxman wrote.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, Major League Baseball confirmed only that 
the draft given Monday to lawmakers was indeed the plan being used 
since March 3.
</P>
<P>
"We expect player ratification within days," Fehr said.

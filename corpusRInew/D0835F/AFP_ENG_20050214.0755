Baseball steroid woes worsen with new book's doping claims

<TEXT>
<P>
Steroid controversy swirled around 
Major League Baseball here Monday as a new book with doping 
accusations hit the stands and players began pre-season training in 
Florida.
</P>
<P>
Former major league slugger Jose Canseco's new book "Juiced: 
Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits and How Baseball Got Big" 
includes claims he injected steroids into several of baseball's 
biggest, literally, stars.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk about Canseco's book," Major League 
Baseball commissioner Bud Selig said Monday. "I'm not going to 
comment on a book I haven't read or seen."
</P>
<P>
Canseco claimed to inject steroids into former one-season home 
run record setter Mark McGwire, New York Yankees star Jason Giambi 
plus Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez when they 
were teammates in Texas and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
All have denied any wrongdoing but the stigma of the accusation 
in the wake of the BALCO steroid scandal revelations and the lack of 
steroid testing prior to 2004 in the major leagues has cast 
suspicion over numerous 1990s stars.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was the right thing to do," Yankees star Tino 
Martinez said of the book. "The guys who were named will have to 
answer questions every day of spring training and will always have 
that allegation hanging over them."
</P>
<P>
Canseco admitted using steroids himself throughout a 16-year 
career in which they were not banned by Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
The 30-team league only began a ban last year. Weak penalties 
were toughened for the upcoming season but remain far below the 
two-year ban imposed under World Anti-Doping Agency rules.
</P>
<P>
Selig was irate at the notion that major league owners and 
players profited from blind eyes to steroid takers because they 
boosted crowds and helped erase long-term labor woes that included 
wiping out the 1994 World Series.
</P>
<P>
"I've heard people say over and over that the owners liked it 
and the players liked it and it brought money in," Selig said. "It's 
so without merit that you wonder how people can even talk about 
it."
</P>
<P>
Adding to the steroid chaos was a report on Fox News Channel 
that Barry Bonds, who has admitted taking BALCO products but said he 
was unaware they were steroids, knowingly used steroids and was 
fearful of being discovered.
</P>
<P>
That report came from Kimberly Bell, who says she was Bonds' 
mistress for nine years and that he admitted using steroids in 1999 
and 2000. Bell has said she intends to write a book on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Bonds' lawyer admits the ballplayer had a relationship with Bell 
but said the steroid claims are to promote the book and come after 
failed attempts to collect money from Bonds.
</P>
<P>
Bonds, 38, is approaching the all-time home run record of 755 by 
Hank Aaron. But a major sponsor pulled out promotional plans in the 
wake of steroid revelations about Bonds.
</P>
<P>
Selig said if Bonds becomes the all-time homer king, his mark 
would be hailed as any other despite the shadow of doping looming 
over recent acheivements.
</P>
<P>
"Breaking records will be celebrated like all records will be 
celebrated," Selig said. "I'm not going to comment on anecdotal 
evidence or no evidence at all."
</P>
<P>
The problem is that there is no evidence because of the lack of 
a testing program. Being clean now that tests are ongoing is no sign 
of purity in past years and the reduced size of several past top 
hitters nags at skeptics.
</P>
<P>
As Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's vice president of 
baseball operations, told ESPN, there is likely no way McGwire can 
distance himself from Canseco's claims despite his repeated denials 
of taking performance enhancers.
</P>
<P>
"There's really not the proof out there to make this possible," 
Alderson said Monday, noting that more and more fans are unhappy.
</P>
<P>
"There's a great deal of suspicion on the part of fans," he 
said. "What I think the fans are most interested in is fixing the 
problem rather than what has happened in the past."
</P>
<P>
Alderson, general manager of the Oakland A's during the era when 
Canseco was powering them into the playoffs. supported the idea that 
Canseco was seeking attention for his book and other moneymaking 
projects.
</P>
<P>
"I think there's something to that," Alderson said, adding that 
"it doesn't seem he's making any effort to make any progress" in 
combating steroids in baseball.
</P>
<P>
Asked if general managers should question the players mentioned 
in the book, Alderson said, "Is it up to a general manager to ask if 
a player is cheating on his wife?"
</P>
<P>
Tony La Russa, manager of the A's during Canseco's era and now 
manager of the reigning National League champion St. Louis 
Cardinals, predicted a bad fate for Canseco.
</P>
<P>
"He'll be a pariah in baseball," La Russa said.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, USA Today reported that the Yankees admitted 
removing the word "steroid" from Giambi's contract during 2001 
talks, saying they felt they were protected on the issue by broader 
language elsewhere in the deal that banned "illegal drugs" or 
"chemical use and dependency."
</P>
<P>
Giambi is set to play for the Yankees as part of his seven-year 
contract worth 120 million dollars but faces the new accusation as 
he prepares for a new season.
</P>
<P>
"You can't control what people are going to write and say," 
Yankees star Derek Jeter said of Giambi's situation. "You just take 
care of what you can control."

SELIG REFUTES STEROID USE IS RAMPANT IN BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>

Responding to criticism that Major League Baseball has not done enough
to deter steroid use among players, Commissioner Bud Selig said
in a telephone interview Friday that the testing program put
in place two years ago showed a significant drop in
positive tests in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Selig said 1 to 2 percent of players in the major
league program tested positive last year, down from 5 to
7 percent in 2003. If about 1,200 players were tested
in 2004, then 12 to 24 tested positive. "This year
I believe we will clean that up," he said.
</P>
<P>
And in the minor league steroid testing program, which began in
2001, Selig said positive results had gone from 11 percent
in 2001 to 4.8 percent in 2002 to 4.0 percent
in 2003 to 1.7 percent last year. Selig said the
results refuted "the thought that this is running wild."
</P>
<P>
Selig was reacting to concerns that baseball's steroid testing program was
not tough enough. A House committee has announced it will
investigate steroid use in baseball, and Selig has been invited
to testify along with a number of present and former
players, among them Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Mesa, Ariz., on Saturday, Selig would
not say whether he would appear before the committee.
</P>
<P>
Rob Manfred, baseball's chief labor relations executive, said he was also
encouraged by the 2004 major league results.
</P>
<P>
"One person from our perspective is too much," he said in
a telephone interview. "However, I think the 1 to 2
percent shows that the steps we have taken have allowed
the game to make progress."
</P>
<P>
The tests were conducted under an agreement between the players and
management in 2002. That program was criticized as too lenient.
Even the penalties under baseball's latest plan are light compared
with those of other sports. A first-time offender draws a
10-day suspension. In international track and field, a first-time offender
is out for two years.
</P>
<P>
"I often hear it's a weak program," Selig said. "The average
player would lose $140,000 if he is suspended for 10
days. Another huge deterrent is naming people."
</P>
<P>
Selig defended baseball's record in trying to clear up the steroid
problem, saying he had devoted the last seven years dealing
with it since learning in 1998 that McGwire used the
supplement androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
Selig said baseball had researched and studied androstenedione, initiated a minor
league testing program, urged Congress to ban over-the-counter sales of
steroid precursors and made steroids a priority in negotiations for
a new collective bargaining agreement.

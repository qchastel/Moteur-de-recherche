<P>
The US Congress has launched an 
undercover probe into illegal steroid use in Major League Baseball 
as well as other professional and amateur sports, a senior member of 
Congress said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have an ongoing investigation. We are doing other 
investigations undercover into professional and amateur sports," 
said Representative Tom Davis, chairman of the House Government 
Reform Committee, who last week called some of baseball's most 
fabled sluggers before a daylong hearing on steroid use in the 
sport.

<P>
"We've held other hearings on drug abuse, but nobody comes to 
them. You bring professional baseball players and the world comes to 
it," Davis told the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a good start, but we consider steroid abuse to 
still be rampant and we're going to have a lot more to say," the 
Virginia Republican said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday a roster of baseball's heavy-hitters, including Mark 
McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa, testified at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Asked Sunday whether baseball officials knew about the probe, 
Davis responded: "They do now."
</P>
<P>
A top baseball official with Major League Baseball said they 
were caught off guard by news of the probe.
</P>
<P>
"That's the first we heard of that," said Rob Manfred, an 
executive vice president with the league told CBS.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the committee has the authority to conduct 
investigations. We understand that steroids are an illegal substance 
in the United States, and anybody who uses those substances is 
obviously at risk, not only under our policies but more importantly, 
under the laws of the United States," Manfred said.

Baseball stars issued subpoenas for US Congrees steroids 
hearing

WASHINGTON, March 9
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steroid-tainted baseball stars Mark 
McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi and Jose Canseco were among 11 
people issued subpoenas here Wednesday to testify next week before a 
US Congress hearing on steroids.
</P>
<P>
Curt Schilling, Frank Thomas and Rafael Palmeiro also were 
ordered to speak March 17 to a House of Representatives Government 
Reform Committee hearing in a session that could blow the lid off 
Major League Baseball's steroid scandal.
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds, the superstar most nagged by steroid accusations, 
was not given the chance to clear his name as he was not invited or 
subpoenaed. Bonds said last week he would testify if his attorney 
thought it was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
"If you bring Bonds up, he's going to be the whole show at this 
point,"  committee chairman Tom Davis told ESPN, saying he hoped to 
avoid a "witch hunt".
</P>
<P>
Players would be under oath and risk perjury if lying in 
testimony, so they face a hot seat if asked whether or not they took 
steroids. They could say yes or no or refuse to answer for 
self-incrimination, a practical guilt admission.
</P>
<P>
"It should be about lifting baseball up out of this cloud - no 
witch hunts, no intention to force somebody into a position where 
they will be prosecuted," committee member Dennis Kucinich told 
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
"The hearings have to be conducted in a way that is not 
prosecutory. It should not be a witch hunt. It should not be about 
poutting people in jail. It should be about looking at the issue, 
raising the discussion.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Giants star Bonds admitted taking products that 
have been identified by prosecutors as steroids as part of the BALCO 
doping scandal.
</P>
<P>
Bonds' personal trainer, Greg Anderson, is among four men 
charged in a steroid distribution ring in the BALCO case. All have 
pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
Bonds owns the major league one-season home run record and could 
eclipse Hank Aaron's career homer record in 2006, but Bonds' BALCO 
link and baseball's lack of steroid testing for key years in his 
career have clouded the feat.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about one individual," Kucinich said. "We need to 
look at the overall effect."
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers have stressed sending a message to American youth 
about the harmful nature of taking steroids, something US President 
George W. Bush mentioned 14 months ago in a State of the Union 
speech.
</P>
<P>
Also issued subpoenas were Robert Manfred, Major League Baseball 
executive vice president; players union executive director Don Fehr; 
San Diego Padres general manager Kevin Towers and former Oakland 
general manager Sandy Alderson, now Major League Baseball's vice 
president of baseball operations.
</P>
<P>
Several players had said they would not attend the hearing. Now 
they must do so or face contempt citations.
</P>
<P>
"Jose Canseco, Donald Fehr and Rob Manfred have already told the 
committee they will testify," Davis said.
</P>
<P>
"The remaining witnesses, however, made it clear - either by 
flatly rejecting the invitation to testify or by ignoring our 
repeated attempts to contact them - they had no intention of 
appearing before the committee.
</P>
<P>
"They have left the committee no alternative but to issue 
subpoenas."
</P>
<P>
Manfred objected to the subpoenas, saying, "It is singularly 
inapporiate to subpoena certain players" because it would tarnish 
their reputations.
</P>
<P>
"We have made an offer (to make witnesses available) that should 
be sufficient to answer any questions about what has gone on with 
regard to Major League Baseball and steroids." Manfred said.
</P>
<P>
Canseco's new book "Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash 
Hits and How Baseball Got Big" named several top stars as steroid 
users, including retired St. Louis star McGwire, New York Yankees 
star Giambi and Palmeiro, a Baltimore teammate of Dominican standout 
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
Sosa and McGwire were involved in an epic homer race in 1998 
where both surpassed the old homer record, one that helped revive 
interest in the sport.
</P>
<P>
"It's important the American people know the facts on baseball's 
steroid scandal and it's important all Americans, especially 
children, know about the dangers of drug use," Davis said.
</P>
<P>
"Consistent with our jurisdiction over the nation's drug policy, 
we need to better understand the steps MLB is taking to get a handle 
on the steroid issue and whether news of those steps and the danger 
posed by steroid use, is reaching America's youth."
</P>
<P>
Baseball executives and union leaders have agreed to toughen 
penalties for this season after imposing the first steroid tests 
last season. An off-season testing program has been started.
</P>
<P>
But a 10-day ban for first-time offenders, 30 days for second 
offenses and 60 days for third-time cheaters is still far shy of 
two-year bans for Olympic sports - a tougher level of testing that 
does not govern US sports leagues.

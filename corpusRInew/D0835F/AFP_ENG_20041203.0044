<P>
Baseball star slugger Barry Bonds told a grand jury that he used a
clear substance and cream from a firm embroiled in a doping scandal,
but he never thought they were steroids, the San Francisco Chronicle
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On its website, the newspaper cited a transcript of Bonds' testimony
to support a claim that would forever taint the 40-year-old Major
League Baseball star's historic home run feats.
</P>
<P>
Bonds hit a single-season record 73 home runs in 2001 and has a
career total of 703 homers - 53 shy of breaking Hank Aaron's all-time
American homer record.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Bonds, testifying on December 4 of last year,
told a federal grand jury investigating the BALCO steroid scandal
that he received and used "clear" and cream substances obtained from
personal trainer Greg Anderson.
</P>
<P>
Anderson, BALCO founder Victor Conte, BALCO executive James Valente
and athletics coach Remy Korchemny are all charged with steroid
distribution. All have pleaded not guilty. A trial is expected to
start in March.
</P>
<P>
Bonds testified that he thought the substances, believed to be the
previously undetectable steroid THG, were a rubbing balm for
arthritis and nutritional supplement flaxseed oil.

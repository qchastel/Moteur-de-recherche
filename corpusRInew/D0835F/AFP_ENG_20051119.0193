US prosecutors track baseball steroid cheats

NEW YORK, Nov 19
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors are seeking access 
to urine samples taken from Major League Baseball (MLB) players in 
2003 while the MLB Players Association fights to protect the 
identity of 104 steroid cheats.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers from the US Attorney's office and the baseball union 
argued in a San Francisco court hearing last Tuesday over granting 
access for prosecutors in the ongoing BALCO steroid case that has 
already produced four convictions.
</P>
<P>
Three federal judges backed the union last year with rulings 
that said the government improperly used search warrants, preventing 
the government from keeping urine samples and identifying paperwork 
linking them to players.
</P>
<P>
The 2003 tests were taken as an anonymous study to judge the 
level of the steroid problem in the sport, results finishing well 
above the five percent level needed to create a punishable steroid 
testing program in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Union officials, who agreed Tuesday to a tougher punishment 
program for steroid and amphetamine dope cheats, want samples and 
records to stay at the labs where they are stored rather than given 
to BALCO investigators, fearing a leak to the public as happened 
with the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
The union argues the government should not be able to take 
records for hundreds of athletes, only from 10 with links to the 
BALCO case that were outlined in a search warrant - including stars 
Barry Bonds, Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
Samples and records from the 2003 survey were to have been 
destroyed, but when the BALCO steroid scandal began just before the 
end of the 2003 season, prosecutors filed subpoenas for all the 
samples and paperwork.
</P>
<P>
Baseball bosses and union leaders objected. Talks on a 
compromise of seizing only 10 samples failed and the fight 
continues.
</P>
<P>
US chemist Patrick Arnold, 39, has pleaded innocent to charges 
of conspiring to distribute performance-enhancing drugs to athletes. 
He is due back in court later this month.

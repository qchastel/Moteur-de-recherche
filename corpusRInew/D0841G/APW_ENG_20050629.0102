<P>
Canada's House of Commons passed landmark legislation Tuesday to legalize gay
marriage, granting same-sex couples legal rights equal to those in traditional
unions between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
The bill passed as expected, despite opposition from Conservatives and religious
leaders. The legislation drafted by Prime Minister Paul Martin's minority
Liberal Party government was also expected to easily pass the Senate and become
federal law by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Although gay marriage is already legal in seven provinces, the bill now grants
all same-sex couples in Canada the same legal rights as those in traditional
union between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands and Belgium are the only other nations that allow gay marriage
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
It was the last major piece of legislation before Parliament recessed for summer
and comes on the first anniversary of Martin's leadership.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three of Martin's Liberal lawmakers voted against the bill and a Cabinet
minister resigned Tuesday over the contentious legislation. But enough allies
rallied to support the bill that has been debated for months.
</P>
<P>
Martin, a Roman Catholic, hailed Tuesday's 158-133 vote as a necessary step for
human rights and the protection of minorities.
</P>
<P>
"We are a nation of minorities," Martin said. "And in a nation of minorities, it
is important that you don't cherry pick rights. A right is a right and that is
what this vote tonight is all about."
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 34,000 gay and lesbian couples in Canada, according to
government statistics.
</P>
<P>
Alex Munter, national spokesman for Canadians for Equal Marriage, which has led
the debate in favor of the law, was triumphant after the vote: "The genius of
Canada, almost unparalleled in the world, is built on shared identity, out of
respect for each other."
</P>
<P>
Munter noted that is has been 30 years since the first homosexual couple applied
for a marriage license in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"This has been a long, arduous road," he said. "Lesbians and gay people are your
brothers and sisters, neighbors, friends and co-workers. At the end of the day,
no argument in favor of exclusion can withstand what people see with their own
eyes: That it is wrong to treat people that they care about in a way that
diminishes their personal choice."
</P>
<P>
Churches have expressed concern that their clergy would be compelled by law to
perform same-sex ceremonies, with couples taking them to court or human rights
tribunals if refused. The legislation, however, states that the bill only covers
civil unions, not religious ones, and no clergy would be forced to perform
same-sex ceremonies unless they choose to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church, the predominant Christian denomination in Canada, has
vigorously opposed the legislation, as well as major Islamic and Sikh
organizations whose members believe the law would rock the foundations of
traditional family.
</P>
<P>
Charles McVety, a spokesman for Defend Marriage Canada and president of Canada
Christian College, called the vote an "onerous breach of trust and the
deconstruction of so much that is dear to our hearts."
</P>
<P>
Flanked by clergymen, McVety vowed his group would work topple MPs who supported
the legislation in the next general elections.
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of the formal fight against the redefinition of
marriage," McVety said. "We will, in the next election, be able to correct this
incredible democratic deficit before us today."
</P>
<P>
The debate in Canada began in December, when the Supreme Court ruled that
passage of same-sex legislation would not violate the constitution.
</P>
<P>
According to most polls, a majority of Canadians supports the right for gays and
lesbians to marry. In the United States, gay marriage is opposed by a majority
of Americans, according to an Associated Press-Ipsos poll taken in November,
shortly after constitutional amendments in 11 states to ban same-sex marriage
were approved.
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts is the only state that allows gay marriages, although Vermont and
Connecticut have approved same-sex civil unions.
</P>
<P>
Roberta Sklar, communications director for the National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force in Washington, D.C., said same-sex American couples applaud
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
"We know that it has been somewhat contentious in Canada, but at the same time
the Canadians have largely approached this issue in a rational and democratic
way and are providing a very positive model for the rest of the world," Sklar
said.
</P>
<P>
Though hundreds of foreigners have come to Canada to seek civil ceremonies since
gay marriages were first allowed in Ontario and British Columbia in 2003, not
all countries or states recognize the unions. While a slew of Israeli men were
married in Toronto City Hall earlier this year, for example, the Israeli
Interior Ministry does not recognize those unions.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the federal government does not recognize same-sex
marriage and most states refuse to acknowledge marriage certificates from gay
and lesbian couples, regardless of where they wed.
</P>
<P>
"Same-sex marriage rights are extremely variable in the United States and
whether Canadian marriages will be respected, state by state, is something yet
to be determined," Sklar said.

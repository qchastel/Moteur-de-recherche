Judge Throws Out Louisiana Ban on Gay Marriage

<P>
A judge on Tuesday threw out an amendment to the
Louisiana Constitution banning gay marriage, a ruling applauded by
civil-rights advocates but dismissed by social conservatives as a
temporary hitch in their campaign to limit the legal rights of gay and
lesbian couples.
</P>
<P>
District Judge William Morvant said that the Louisiana Legislature,
which wrote the amendment this spring before voters overwhelmingly
approved it in September, had failed to make it narrow enough.
</P>
<P>
According to state law, constitutional amendments are valid only if
they have a single legal purpose. This one, Morvant ruled, had two:
The first was to ban gay marriage; the second was to ban civil unions
and domestic partnerships. Morvant said the second ban was
accomplished with this sentence: ''A legal status identical or
substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals
shall not be valid or recognized.``
</P>
<P>
That phrasing was not contained in early drafts of the amendment.
It was added during legislative debate at the behest of lobbyists who
wanted to go beyond a gay-marriage ban, said Evan Wolfson, executive
director of Freedom to Marry, a nonprofit group that works nationwide
for ''marriage equality.``
</P>
<P>
''The Christian Coalition got greedy,`` he said. ''You know the old
saying: Pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered.``
</P>
<P>
Michael Johnson, an attorney for the Alliance Defense Fund, a
nonprofit group that opposes gay marriage, said Morvant's decision
would be appealed.
</P>
<P>
''Clearly the people knew what the amendment was intended to do and
they agree with it,`` Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
Gene Mills, executive director of the Louisiana Family Forum,
another group fighting to ban gay marriage, said that he
''fundamentally disagreed`` with the judge's decision. He described it
as a minor setback. ''This is the third quarter, late in the game,``
Mills said. ''We anticipated opposition in the legislative process,
and we overcame it there. We anticipated opposition at the
pre-amendment level, and we overcame it there. We've got to play a
whole other quarter of ball. And we think we will be successful in the
end.``
</P>
<P>
Gay-rights supporters had argued that the amendment was unnecessary
since Louisiana already had a law banning gay marriage. But opponents
argued that without a constitutional amendment, gays could attempt to
''export`` marriages from other states to Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
If that happened, Mills said, institutions such as churches and
schools would be forced to accept homosexuality. And the public, he
argued, would be forced to underwrite the costs of gay relationships,
such as AIDS. While heterosexual relationships result in children, he
said, ''You don't get the equivalent in a homosexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
``You get disease,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 78 percent of voters in Louisiana supported the amendment,
one of 13 similar measures states are weighing this fall.
</P>
<P>
Missouri voters approved an amendment banning same-sex marriage
earlier this year. Measures are on the November ballot in Arkansas,
Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon and Utah. Most if not all are expected to succeed.
</P>
<P>
Randy Evans, an attorney representing a Louisiana gay-rights group
called Forum for Equality, predicted that Tuesday's decision would
send civil-rights advocates in other states scrambling to see if they
could bring legal challenges on similar grounds. And, he said, it will
``give a boost to people around the country who are fighting these
same amendments.''

<P>
Voters in eleven US states voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to impose
constitutional bans on gay marriage, one of the hottest issues in
this year's presidential election, results showed.
</P>
<P>
Returns showed that all 11 state referenda on constitutional
amendments that define marriage as being exclusively between a man
and a woman had passed across the nation.
</P>
<P>
The measures, similar in structure across the nation, succeeded in
Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, North
Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon and Utah.
</P>
<P>
The amendments generally passed with a 3-1 majority, except in Oregon
where earlier returns showed it had succeeded by about 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ohio's amendment was the most sweeping, also banning any legal status
"that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance or
effect of marriage."
</P>
<P>
That would create a legal barrier to civil unions, as well as
marriages for gay couples.
</P>
<P>
"It's a democratic tidal wave for marriage," said Matt Daniels,
president of the Alliance for Marriage, one of the groups that pushed
for the bans.
</P>
<P>
The move to change state constitutions reflected a growing public
debate on same-sex marriage after Massachusetts earlier this year
became the first US state to sanction such unions.
</P>
<P>
The politically and socially divisive issue drove a wedge between
civil rights lobbyists and conservative Christians earlier this year,
climaxing in a failed bid, backed by President George W. Bush, to
pass a federal constitutional amendment banning the practice.
</P>
<P>
The measure had been widely expected to pass in all 11 states where
it featured on the ballot, said Jennie Drage Bowser, policy analyst
with the National Conference of State Legislatures, which monitored
state ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
"Congress didn't really take this issue up this year in earnest and
this sends a message to Washington that a lot of Americans feel
strongly about this issue," she told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"But in many ways, these results also show that it's a state issue
and that the states can deal with it themselves without federal
government intervention," she said.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of legal bans on gay marriage were overjoyed that their
stance had been so heavily endorsed across the country.
</P>
<P>
"These state amendments are a political dress rehearsal for the
federal marriage amendment," the Alliance for Marriage's Daniels
said.
</P>
<P>
Gay activists were angry but unsurprised at the development and vowed
that the fight for legal equality for homosexual was far from over.
</P>
<P>
"We have lost a battle but the process has begun of winning the war,"
said David Buckel, director of the marriage project at gay rights
lobby group Lambda Legal, which vigorously opposed the amendments.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these states already had their legislatures write
discrimination into the statutes, and now they have enshrined it in
their constitutions," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Political observers had said that the emotional issue of legalising
gay marriage -- along with other issues including abortion and stem
cell research -- could mobilise conservative voters at the polls
Tuesday, boosting the re-election prospects for Republican Bush.
</P>
<P>
The midwestern state of Missouri approved a constitutional ban on gay
marriage by a huge margin in August, as did Louisiana in September.
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts legalized gay marriage in May while the eastern state
of Vermont allows civil unions. But in other states, the public
reception to such innovation was frosty.
</P>
<P>
"We knew going into these amendment fights that we were going to take
it on the chin in most places," said Matt Foreman, executive director
of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
</P>
<P>
But he said: "This issue is going to be resolved by the US Supreme
Court, and it's not going to give a damn what these state
constitutions say."

<P>
The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise
homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in
Europe to condone same sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
It will also give gay couples the right to adopt.
</P>
<P>
The plan "recognises all rights for homosexuals, when it comes to
qualifying for a pension, administering an estate, asking for a loan,
authorising surgery for a partner," cabinet spokeswoman Maria Teresa
Fernandez de la Vega told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"But also when it comes to asking to adopt a child."
</P>
<P>
The idea has been fiercely opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and a
senior cleric earlier this week blasted the plans.
</P>
<P>
"It would impose on society a virus, something false, which will have
negative consequences for social life," insisted Juan Antonio
Martinez Camino, spokesman for Spain's Episcopal Conference.
</P>
<P>
But according to an opinion poll conducted in late July, some
two-thirds of Spaniards are in favour of gay marriages and now the
cabinet has approved the bill such liaisons could become legal from
as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who
took office in April, has made legalising gay marriages a key element
of his social policy despite outrage from the Church.
</P>
<P>
Spain "is in the forefront of Europe and of the world in the struggle
against centuries of discrimination," de la Vega said. She said that
about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants were homosexual.
</P>
<P>
Once the reform becomes law Spain will join the Netherlands and
Belgium in allowing full homosexual marriage, though only the
Netherlands allows gay couples to adopt. Such unions are also legal
in six Canadian provinces and the northeastern US state of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
De la Vega said: "There are thousands of children already living in
Spain with homosexual parents and more than 50 studies show there are
no differences between children who grow up with homosexual parents
and others."
</P>
<P>
"Most Spanish people think what is important in adoption is the
well-being of the child quite apart from the sexual orientation of
the parents," she said.
</P>
<P>
Some 14 articles of the civil code will be altered so that the words
"man and woman" and "father and mother" are replaced by "partners" or
"parents".
</P>
<P>
According to Justice Minister Juan Fernando Lopez de Aguilar, "this
initiative has not been taken against anything or anyone"  and he
told the news conference that the government "is cooperating with the
(Roman Catholic) Church and considers that an open conflict with it
is not good."
</P>
<P>
"This law is part of the Socialist programme which has been voted for
by the Spanish,"said Beatriz Gimeno, president of the country's Gay,
Lesbian and Transexuals Federation.
</P>
<P>
"The Church has nothing to say about it. This interventionist
tendency by the Church is the virus and must be eradicated," .
</P>
<P>
The message focused particularly on countries supporting the US-led
coalition in Iraq and pointed out that their interests were
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
"We must start the resistance from now ... against the Crusader
campaign ... like resistance in Iraq, Afghanistan, in Palestine and
in Chechnya," he said, taking aim in particular at the United States,
Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
"Young Muslims, here is our message ... if we are killed or taken
prisoner, continue the path (of resistance) after us. Don't betray
God and his Prophet," said the voice attributed to be Zawahiri's.
</P>
<P>
"It's the era of Muslim resistance, after the (Arab) governments
submitted to the Zionist occupant. We should learn the lesson of
Chechnya, Afghanistan, of Iraq, of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
"Don't wait for the American, British, French, South Korean,
Hungarian and Polish forces to enter Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula,
Yemen and Algeria to start the resistance," the speaker added.
</P>
<P>
"We should start the resistance from now. The interests of the
Americans, English, Australian, French, Polish, Norwegian, South
Korean and Japanese are everywhere," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All (these countries) participated in the occupation of Afghanistan
or Iraq or Chechnya, or help Israel to survive," added the voice.
</P>
<P>
Zawahiri, the righthand man of Osama bin Laden, was last heard in a
videotape broadcast by the Qatar-based news channel on September 9 in
which he forecast a US defeat in Iraq and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The US intelligence agency, the CIA, said then it believed that tape
to be authentic and could have been recently recorded.

IN REVERSAL, SOCIAL SECURITY AGENCY ACCEPTS MARRIAGES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Social Security Administration reversed itself late Monday and
said that it would recognize marriage licenses issued for
heterosexual couples by the clerk of the town of New Paltz, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that after getting a better understanding of the legal
authority that local officials had to issue marriage licenses, they
decided to overturn a policy that had been in effect for most of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Until the reversal, the agency had refused to accept as
identification any marriage document issued in New Paltz since
February, when an official gained national attention by performing
same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
But Social Security officials failed to differentiate between the
village of New Paltz, where the homosexual weddings took place, and
the larger town of New Paltz, which refuses to recognize same-sex
marriages, and has the sole authority to issue legally binding
marriage licenses.
</P>
<P>
The village in Ulster County issued same-sex marriage affidavits to
about 300 gay couples. The town, which surrounds the village, has not
issued marriage licenses to any gay couple.
</P>
<P>
About 125 heterosexual couples have been married in New Paltz since
February. But it was not until a recently married local woman, Susie
Kilpatrick, went to a regional Social Security office on Dec. 3 to
legally take her husband's name that the new policy drew complaints.
</P>
<P>
When her application was rejected, Kilpatrick and her husband, Jeremy
Wilkening, sought help from their congressman, Rep. Maurice Hinchey.
Hinchey, a Democrat, wrote a letter urging the Social Security
commissioner to recognize that the policy was arbitrary and
overreaching.
</P>
<P>
Kilpatrick, 30, said she expected to try to change her name again
next year.
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted that this has been reversed," she said. "And we're
sympathetic and hopeful that someday this will be extended to all
couples that make the same lifelong commitments."
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by his office in Washington, Hinchey, on his
way back from Ukraine, said the Social Security Administration should
also overturn similar policies that remain in effect in Asbury Park,
N.J., and in other places around the country that have permitted gay
marriage ceremonies.

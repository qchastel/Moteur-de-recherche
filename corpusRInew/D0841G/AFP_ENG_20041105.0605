<P>
A court decision Friday made Saskatchewan the seventh Canadian
province to authorize marriage between people of the same sex.
</P>
<P>
Same-sex marriage is now allowed in more than half of Canada's 10
provinces and three territories.
</P>
<P>
Canadian media said five homosexual couples had asked to be married
in Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
Citing legal precedents elsewhere in Canada, the Saskatchewan court
ruled the Canadian law limiting marriage to a man and a woman is
contrary to Canada's constitutional protections for all citizens, and
is thus unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Same-sex marriage was first authorized in Canada in June 2003 by an
Ontario court, followed by court decisions in the provinces of
British Columbia, Quebec, Manitoba and Nova Scotia, and the Yukon
Territory.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has been saying for more than a year that it
wants to legalize same-sex marriage, but is awaiting a decision from
the Canadian Supreme Court on the constitutionality of a draft law it
has tabled on the question.
</P>
<P>
The government specifically wants a ruling on whether the draft law
protects the right of churches to refuse to officiate in same-sex
marriage.

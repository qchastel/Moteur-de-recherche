Dublin approves lesbian couple's challenge to Ireland over gay
marriage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lesbian couple who wed in Canada can seek to have their union
legally recognized in Ireland, a judge ruled Tuesday in a case he
predicted would have deep consequences for this predominantly
Catholic country.
</P>
<P>
High Court Justice Liam McKechnie said lawyers representing Ann
Louise Gilligan and Katherine Zappone had presented an arguable case
that merited a full hearing, likely to take place next year.
</P>
<P>
Gilligan and Zappone _ who were married in British Columbia in
September 2003 within months of the legalization of same-sex marriage
there _ are the first gay couple in Ireland to go to court to seek
state recognition of a foreign marriage.
</P>
<P>
The case is also a legal first for Europe, where Belgium and the
Netherlands already allow same-sex marriages and several other
nations grant homosexual couples similar tax, inheritance and
child-rearing rights as husbands and wives have. Britain and Spain
plan to follow suit soon.
</P>
<P>
Legal observers say the Irish women's case, if successful here, could
inspire similar lawsuits in the most conservative quarters of Europe,
where gay couples are denied the rights of married heterosexual
couples.
</P>
<P>
Zappone and Gilligan are demanding that Ireland's tax collection
agency, the Revenue Commissioners, allow them to file as a married
couple rather than as two single people, which involves paying more
tax.
</P>
<P>
The judge said the case "isn't simply about tax bands." He noted that
in a country where homosexuality itself was outlawed until 1993, any
move to accord gay couples the same legal rights as husbands and
wives would have "profound ethical, cultural and religious"
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned that his ruling offered no indication as to whether
the couple's complaint would be upheld or rejected, merely that it
contained sufficient merit to be heard.
</P>
<P>
Zappone, a member of Ireland's government-appointed Human Rights
Commission, and Gilligan, a Dublin philosophy lecturer, have been
partners for 23 years and live together in Brittas, a beachside
resort south of Dublin. They have worked together on poverty research
and feminist rights projects since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a happy day. This is a happy case," Zappone declared
outside the High Court, Ireland's second-highest court.
</P>
<P>
"We have been exceptionally blessed by our unconditional love for,
and fidelity to, one another," said Zappone, with her partner
standing beside her. "Yesterday and today are simply the first steps
to seek legal recognition of our lifelong love and faithfulness."
</P>
<P>
Their lead lawyer, Gerard Hogan, argued Monday that neither Ireland's
1937 constitution nor its more recent tax laws explicitly defines
marriage as solely between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
Hogan, one of Ireland's most prominent experts on constitutional law,
said the Revenue Commissioners "have discriminated against them in an
unjust and invidious manner, in breach of their constitutional rights
and the European Convention on Human Rights."
</P>
<P>
He conceded that the Irish Constitution drafted 67 years ago by
then-Prime Minister Eamon de Valera undoubtedly presumed that
"marriage" meant between a husband and wife, but argued that
constitutional law should not be trapped within "the permafrost of
1937."
</P>
<P>
The case, if successful, would have major implications for Ireland's
unmarried couples, both heterosexual and homosexual, in this
predominantly Catholic country of 3.9 million. The 2001 census
identified 77,600 households involving unmarried partners, among them
1,300 homosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
Under Irish law, married couples enjoy advantages over unmarried
couples, who pay higher income and inheritance taxes.

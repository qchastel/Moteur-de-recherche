Homosexual rights activists urged the
government Friday to grant homosexual couples the right to marry.
</P>
<P>
"Jennifer" (alias) met her Chinese girlfriend in England when she
was studying for her doctoral degree. When Jennifer graduated this
year, she faced the difficult choice of staying in England with her
girlfriend or returning to Taiwan to take care of her ailing mother.
Because Taiwan does not allow homosexual marriages or civil unions,
there is no way for Jennifer's girlfriend to come to Taiwan as her
partner.
</P>
<P>
Jennifer is just one of the cases revealed by the Taiwan Leshand
Association on lesbian couples' real life predicaments.
</P>
<P>
Gay couples are not doing any better either, according to the
Taiwan Tongzhi [Homosexual] Hotline Association, which revealed that
"Ted" (alias) , a gay man whose boyfriend underwent surgery for
cancer, was not allowed to take care of his boyfriend in the hospital
because the hospital did not consider him as a family member. The two
associations made the revelations during a Legislative Yuan hearing
Friday on the legalization of homosexual marriages.

<P>
Gender/Sexuality Rights Association Secretary-General Wang Ping
said that homosexuals should enjoy civil rights just like any other
people.
</P>
<P>
"If homosexuals are citizens equal to others, they should be
allowed to choose to enter into marriage or not. But at present, the
problem is that they cannot choose," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"Marriage, as a social mechanism, offers many rights and
protections. But homosexual couples cannot choose to marry, and
consequently they lose their entitlement to many civil rights, " she
said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association Public Affairs Director Ashley
Wu said that homosexual couples are facing great difficulties in life
and death because Taiwan does not allow homosexual marriages or civil
unions.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that his organization conducted a poll at the end
of 2005 on homosexual marriages, and the poll showed that 89 percent
of the homosexuals surveyed agree that homosexual marriages should be
legalized, and 81 percent consider it to be a legal right.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, 52 percent of the surveyed said that they want to be
entitled to the rights enjoyed by married people, including lower
taxes and the right to sign their partners' surgery consent forms.
</P>
<P>
"It is neither justified nor fair to deprive people of certain
rights because of their sexual orientation," he said.

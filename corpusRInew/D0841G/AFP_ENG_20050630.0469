The legal status of homosexual unions in the world
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, June 30
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Spanish government Thursday approved 
plans for homosexual marriage, including the right of gay couples to 
adopt, making the country the most liberal in Europe, with Belgium 
and the Netherlands, in the field of gay rights.
</P>
<P>
A country-by-country review of current legislation:
</P>
<P>
- BELGIUM: Marriage between homosexuals became legal on June 1, 
2003: since February 2004 it also covers foreigners. For the union 
to be valid one of the partners needs to be Belgian or to live in 
Belgium. Gay couples have the same rights as heterosexual couples, 
in particular insofar as inheritance and succession rights are 
concerned, but do not have the right to adopt.
</P>
<P>
- CANADA: The Canadian lower house of parliament approved on 
June 28 a bill legalising gay marriages and adoption. The bill is 
expected to be passed by the Senate at the end of July. Before the 
federal legislation the majority of provinces had approved gay 
marriages.
</P>
<P>
- NETHERLANDS: The Dutch Senate adopted in December 2000 
legislation authorising civil homosexual marriage, the first country 
to do so, and the adoption by two same-sex parents of children 
provided the children have Dutch nationality.
</P>
<P>
- NORTHERN EUROPE: Denmark was the first country in the world to 
authorise (on October 1, 1989) a "registered partnership" between 
gays. Homosexual couples have the same rights as heterosexual 
partners, except in the areas of insemination and adoption.
</P>
<P>
Norway (1993), Sweden (1994), Iceland (1996) and Finland (2001) 
followed suit. In all these countries the law gives gay couples the 
same legal and social rights as married heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is the only one to authorise adoption by gay couples 
(since February 2003). In Denmark gay couples can only adopt their 
own children from previous relationships.
</P>
<P>
- BRITAIN: A bill passed by parliament in March 2004 and 
expected to come into force in December this year, opens up the 
possibility for gays to sign a "civil partnership" which would 
authorise the continued payment of a pension in the event of the 
death of a partner or exempt the survivor from inheritance tax on 
property owned by the deceased partner.
</P>
<P>
In November 2002 a law was passed allowing gay couples to 
adopt.
</P>
<P>
- FRANCE: In October 1999 the Civil Pact of Solidarity (PACS) 
giving legal status to non-married couples, including gays, came 
into effect.
</P>
<P>
The two parties enjoy some but not all of the tax and social 
benefits of married couples, in particular in the field of 
inheritance. Single people may adopt but not avowed homosexual 
couples.
</P>
<P>
Noel Mamere, the Green party mayor of the Bordeaux suburb of 
Begles in southwest France, "married" two gay men in June but a 
court declared the ceremony void the following month.
</P>
<P>
- GERMANY: On August 1, 2001 a "registered partnership" came 
into effect which gives gay couples some rights enjoyed by 
different-sex married couples, such as; the possibility of adopting 
the name of the partner, inheritance rights, gifts and tax on 
possessions, health and unemployment insurance. But it does not 
confer the tax advantages enjoyed by married couples or the right to 
adopt.
</P>
<P>
The registered partnership allows an individual gay or lesbian 
to adopt a child while living in a gay couple. However the 
individual alone is legally responsible for the child and not the 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
- CROATIA: The parliament adopted a law in mid-July 2003, a law 
which provides gay couples with the same rights as defacto 
heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
- NEW ZEALAND: The New Zealand parliament adopted in December 
2004 legislation which confers to gay couples, who have officially 
declared their union, to have the same rights as heterosexual 
married couples. But the law does not change the marriage act which 
defines it as a union between a "man and woman."
</P>
<P>
- PORTUGAL: A 2001 law recognises de facto couples, regardless 
of sex, of more than two years and provides a number of tax benefits 
enjoyed by married couples. Adoption by homosexual couples remains 
illegal.
</P>
<P>
- SWITZERLAND: On June 5 referendum the Swiss voted in favour of 
a "registered partnership" for same-sex couples. The partnership is 
based on existing marriage laws but is distinct from them.
</P>
<P>
It bans adoption and medically-assisted reproduction. In the 
cantons of Geneva and Zurich forms of the French PACS operate for 
all administrative questions.
</P>
<P>
- SOUTH AFRICA: In September 2002 the South African 
constitutional court recognised the right of gay couples to adopt 
children.
</P>
<P>
- UNITED STATES: Since 2004 Massachusetts became the only US 
state to authorise gay marriages while Vermont and Connecticut, also 
in the northeast of the country, allow civil unions which offer 
homosexuals some of the rights enjoyed by heterosexual couples. The 
state of New Jersey in December 1997 allowed adoption by homosexual 
couples.

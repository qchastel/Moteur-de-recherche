Poland's senate approves draft bill allowing same-sex partnership
rights
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Poland's upper house of parliament approved a bill Friday that would
allow gay couples to gain legal partnership rights, immediately
drawing sharp criticism from the nation's powerful Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
The senate voted 38-23 with 15 abstentions to send the draft to the
lower house, or Sejm, where the bill was expected to meet resistance.
</P>
<P>
If it becomes law, the bill would allow gay couples to register with
city or town officials, which would give them inheritance rights and
other legal guarantees _ but not the right to adopt children.
</P>
<P>
Senator Maria Szyszkowska, a member of Prime Minister Marek Belka's
Democratic Left Alliance who authored the bill, said the decision
marks the "start of building tolerance in Poland."
</P>
<P>
But Father Jerzy Kloch, spokesman for the Polish Episcopate blasted
the measure, saying it violates Poland's constitution, which says "a
marriage is a union between a man and a woman."
</P>
<P>
"If this bill was implemented it would bring irreparable social
damage for marriage and family and upbringing of children," Kloch
said.
</P>
<P>
"The church has made its stand on the issue known many times during
meetings between the church and the government and we hope such law
will not be implemented in Poland."
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II, a native of Poland whose words carry great sway in
this predominantly Catholic country, last month reiterated his
outspoken opposition to gay marriage. He warned against attempts to
tamper with what he called "the irreplaceable" institution of
marriage-based family in an apparent reference to moves like granting
homosexual couples social benefits.
</P>
<P>
Szymon Niemiec, the head of Poland's Association of Gays and Lesbians
said the upper house's decision was a "huge success for Poland's
democracy" but acknowledged it would be an uphill struggle to get the
bill passed into law.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first, very difficult and very important step toward
making this a normal country," Niemiec told Polish news agency PAP.
</P>
<P>
"A long a hard road is still ahead of us, but the most important step
has been taken. This is a huge change."

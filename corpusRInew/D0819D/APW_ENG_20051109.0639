Neighbors join forces to patrol riot-scarred French towns

ASNIERES, France
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As night falls, residents-turned-sentinels are setting off on rounds of their
riot-hit towns looking to prevent more arson and attacks.
</P>
<P>
Several towns in the suburbs of Paris and elsewhere are organizing themselves to
restore order after France's worst violence since the May 1968 student riots.
Unlike police, the key to their success is gentle persuasion and a watchful
eye.
</P>
<P>
"We are not Rambos!" Manuel Aeschliman, the mayor of this town northwest of
Paris, reminds a dozen volunteers as they set off for their rounds. "No
intervention: If you see something, call it in."
</P>
<P>
In cities across France, residents are holding overnight vigils in their homes
and in public buildings liable to come under attack.
</P>
<P>
Aeschliman, a conservative politician close to hard-line Interior Minister
Nicolas Sarkozy, has been rounding up his neighborhood watch team at sunset
since rioters set fire to a dozen cars and a warehouse last week.
</P>
<P>
The group of stocky men and a couple women take turns patrolling until dawn,
splitting into teams of two armed with nothing more than a fire
extinguisher.
</P>
<P>
They shun the tag of vigilante, saying they are merely concerned citizens out to
dissuade rioters and help an overwhelmed police.
</P>
<P>
"This is a quiet town; it's pretty rare for anything to happen here," said Marc,
a 43-year-old architect, as he set off in his car with student
Capucine.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, they both declined to give their last names, saying they did not
want to be branded as informers.
</P>
<P>
All the volunteers patrolling Asnieres on Tuesday night were white, unlike the
majority of the rioters, many of them French-born children of immigrants fed up
with discrimination and bleak prospects in the projects.
</P>
<P>
In the suburb of Kremlin-Bicetre, south of Paris, residents of the Martinets
housing complex spontaneously banded together after violent clashes between
rioters and police at the weekend left 50 cars torched.
</P>
<P>
"We sleep in turns, one night out of two," said Muriel Prudent, 53, who has been
living in a small house between the towering housing blocks and a gas station
for more than 25 years. "We are all sticking together; it's important right
now."
</P>
<P>
Her neighbor Claude is afraid to walk the streets at night. He watches the
youths from the safety of his darkened first-floor window and warns neighbors by
telephone if he sees anything suspect.
</P>
<P>
"We are jumpy. Around us, everything has burned. It is no wonder we are scared,"
said shopkeeper Roland, a canister of tear gas tucked a jacket
pocket.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, volunteers are holding overnight vigils in public buildings likely to
come under attack. Lights turned on full blast to advertise their presence, they
cheerfully share pizza and sodas and talk through the night.
</P>
<P>
"We might as well welcome young people and residents and gather to talk," said
Helene Moctar, 19, who runs the "Le Village" youth center in
Saint-Martin-d'Heres, a town of 30,000 near the southern city of
Grenoble.
</P>
<P>
"We are all nonviolent and I think that all these initiatives, even if they
don't stop the violence, limit the damage."

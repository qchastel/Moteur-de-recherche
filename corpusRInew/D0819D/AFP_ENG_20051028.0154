Dozens of youths went 
on a rampage, burning vehicles and vandalising buildings in a tough 
Paris suburb Friday in an act of rage following the death by 
electrocution of two teenagers trying to flee police.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three cars were gutted by fire and the windows of a 
shopping centre were smashed in the riot in Clichy-sous-Bois, which 
finally ended before dawn. No arrests were made and there were no 
reports of injuries.

<P>
According to police, the violence erupted after two boys, aged 
14 and 16, died when they scaled a wall of an electrical relay 
station and fell against a transformer.
</P>
<P>
The two had been trying to escape from police responding to the 
attempted robbery of a nearby worksite, officers said. A third boy 
who had also jumped the wall was seriously hurt.

Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said the three had not been 
"physically pursued" by the police.
</P>
<P>
He added that measures should be taken to counter such urban 
violence, and said he aimed to equip police cars with cameras and 
officers with "non-lethal weapons."

<P>
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and 
Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy held a crisis meeting Friday on 
running riots that have plunged France into its worst explosion of 
urban violence in decades.
</P>
<P>
The number one and number two in President Jacques Chirac's 
embattled government huddled in Villepin's offices to discuss ways 
to tackle the troubles, which were headed into their ninth straight 
night with 30 vehicles being set alight in the Bobigny suburb east 
of the capital even as the ministers met.
</P>
<P>
Gangs of youths have gone on the rampage since October 27, when 
two teenagers were electrocuted in a tough, low-income suburb north 
of Paris as they hid in an electrical sub-station to flee a police 
identity check.
</P>
<P>
The riots have spread each night, eventually surrounding Paris 
then, overnight Thursday, flaring also in Marseille, Dijon and in 
Normandy -- and even in central parts of the capital itself.
</P>
<P>
Overwhelmed police have found themselves powerless to stop the 
conflagration, which has seen over 1,000 vehicles torched and more 
than 200 people arrested amid fears that the country's racial and 
social divisions were fuelling the violence, the worst seen since a 
1968 student revolt.
</P>
<P>
As the violence has progressed, it has taken on an increasingly 
dangerous tone, with widespread fire-bombings, occasional shots 
fired at riot squads -- and prosecutors revealing that a handicapped 
woman was deliberately set on fire.
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors Friday, a 56-year-old woman was unable 
to get off a bus targeted by a Molotov cocktail late Wednesday in 
the northern Paris suburb of Sevran. She was allegedly doused with 
petrol by one youth, then others threw a flaming rag on her. Rescued 
by the driver, she was taken to hospital with severe burns to 20 
percent of her body.
</P>
<P>
Overnight Thursday, more than 600 vehicles and several 
businesses were set on fire, and 78 people arrested in the Paris 
area, according to police.
</P>
<P>
Most of the arson has happened in the low-income neighbourhoods 
that lie well outside the capital, far from its famous monuments and 
tourist sights, although seven cars were also burnt in poorer 
northern and eastern districts in central Paris overnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Those responsible are groups of young Muslim men, the sons of 
families from France's former Arab and African colonial territories, 
who have said in interviews that they are protesting economic 
misery, racial discrimination and provocative policing.
</P>
<P>
The leader of one police union, Bruno Beschizza, described the 
riots as "urban terrorism", led by a radicalised minority of 
criminals and "Islamic radicals".
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy, who harbours ambitions of becoming president in 2007 
elections, has claimed that they are being orchestrated by unknown 
organisers.
</P>
<P>
But police commanders contradicted him Friday, saying "there was 
nothing to support the existence of an organisation behind the 
riots" and added that speculation of "a radical Islamic influence is 
baseless."
</P>
<P>
Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe of the opposition Socialist Party 
warned against hastily lumping together "one religion, Islam, and a 
few extremists" in apportioning blame.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the intensity and prolificacy of the violence has 
badly rattled the government, making it waver between the "zero 
tolerance" policies of Sarkozy and calls for a more conciliatory 
approach.
</P>
<P>
Marine Le Pen, daughter of extreme-right politician Jean-Marie 
Le Pen and deputy leader of his anti-immigration National Front 
party, called for a state of emergency to be declared in the 
worst-hit areas.

<P>
France was on high alert Friday for a 
possible upsurge of violence as the country headed into a long 
holiday weekend, two weeks after rioting broke out in a run-down 
suburb of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Rioters torched 463 cars across the country overnight and 201 
people were arrested, figures almost identical to the previous 
night, national police said.
</P>
<P>
The violence was still in marked decrease from the peak of the 
trouble on Sunday, when more than 1,400 cars were set alight across 
the country.
</P>
<P>
Seven policeman were injured in overnight clashes with youths, 
four of them in the eastern city of Lyon.
</P>
<P>
Exceptional security measures have been taken in the capital for 
Armistice Day commemorations to take place later Friday, with some 
2,200 police deployed for the event.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac and Defense Minister Michele 
Alliot-Marie were to attend the ceremonies on the capital's 
Champs-Elysees avenue.
</P>
<P>
Around the country, 12,000 police and gendarmes were to remain 
mobilised over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
France has been rocked by two weeks of car-burnings, arson 
attacks and rioting carried out mostly by young Arab and black 
residents of poor suburban residential estates, who complain of 
economic misery and racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The violence erupted following the accidental deaths of two 
teenagers electrocuted while hiding from police in an electrical 
sub-station.
</P>
<P>
Calm has been gradually returning to French cities after the 
government declared a state of emergency on Tuesday allowing the 
imposition of curfews, which have been declared in some 30 towns and 
cities.
</P>
<P>
Curfews for unaccompanied children under the age of 16 were 
still in effect in more than 20 towns on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his second public appearance since the rioting began on 
October 27, Chirac said Thursday that the country needed to learn 
lessons from the two weeks of unrest, while stressing the need to 
restore order.
</P>
<P>
"When the time comes and order has been established, it will be 
necessary to draw all the consequences from this crisis and do it 
with much courage and lucidity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever our origins we are all children of the republic. We 
can all claim the same rights but must of course all accept the same 
duties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said he would not permit any 
police excesses, after eight officers were suspended pending an 
investigation into an alleged assault on a young man in a Paris 
suburb.
</P>
<P>
Controversy has surrounded a call by the tough-talking Sarkozy 
for foreigners convicted over the rioting to be deported -- a 
measure denounced by left-wing parties and campaigning groups as a 
breach of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy also said on television Thursday he had no regrets about 
using the word "rabble" to refer to young troublemakers in poor 
suburbs -- a comment seen as having contributed to the eruption of 
violence.
</P>
<P>
"When I say they are rabble, that's what they call themselves," 
the minister stressed. "Let's stop calling them youngsters. If you 
call hoodlums 'youngsters' you risk making generalisations about 
young people."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin has outlined a twin-track 
initiative to defuse the unrest, invoking emergency measures under a 
law dating back to the Algerian war, as well as unveiling a package 
of social assistance for stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Thierry Breton meanwhile told Britain's 
Financial Times business daily Friday that France could lift 
restrictions on service industries and business start-ups to create 
jobs in the riot-hit suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Breton said he would present the prime minister with a batch of 
fresh ideas once the violence dies down.

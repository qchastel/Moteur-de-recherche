The recent riots in the French 
capital claimed Monday the first death as a man died of his 
injuries at a hospital after he was beaten in the riots, officials
said.

A spokesman for the Interior Ministry confirmed the death of 
Jean-Jacques Le Chenadec but gave no other details.

The man was attacked by a youth outside his home when he rushed
out of his apartment to distinguish the fire on a garbage can, 
said Alain Rahmouni, a national police spokesman. He was in a coma
after the attack.

French police said Monday that a total of 1,408 vehicles were 
torched and 395 arrests made overnight in a riot across the 
country.

These are the highest figures recorded since the troubles broke
out on Oct. 27.

At least 1,295 vehicles were burned and 312 people arrested 
during the night from Saturday to Sunday, police said in a 
statement.

The violence was triggered after the accidental electrocution 
of two teenagers in an electrical substation when they tried to 
flee a police identity check in Clichy-sous-Bois, a northeast 
Paris suburb.

The riot has spread to 200 city suburbs and towns, including 
Marseille, Nice, Toulouse, Lille, Rennes, Rouen, Bordeaux and

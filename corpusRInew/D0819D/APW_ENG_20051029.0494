Police detained 14 people Saturday after a second night of rioting that broke
out in a working-class Paris suburb following the deaths of two youths who were
electrocuted while trying to evade police, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of angry youths torched parked cars and threw rocks at police overnight
in Clichy-sous-Bois, north of the capital, lightly injuring 15 officers and a
journalist, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Mobile police units were called in after assailants opened fire on a police riot
vehicle, and restored order around 2 a.m. About 300 police were remaining on
site until further notice, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of local residents held a peaceful march after daybreak Saturday between
City Hall and the electrical transformer where the youths died seeking cover
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The regional government said about 400 youths took part in the rioting
overnight, but city officials insisted that estimate was too
high.
</P>
<P>
Major French TV networks led their afternoon newscasts with images of the
violence, showing officers firing tear gas and rowdy youths throwing rocks and
overturning large trash bins.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen people were arrested; five were later released, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's march, Mayor Claude Dilain called for calm, urging the public to
"remain dignified" amid lingering anger over the deaths of the 15- and
17-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen teens, wearing T-shirts with the words "Dead for Nothing" written
on them, marched at the front as the demonstrators walked past a string of
charred vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to The Associated Press by telephone, Deputy Mayor Olivier Klein said:
"We are all in shock."
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, many of our youths face tough social situations, and it is true
that the deaths of these two other youths upsets them a lot," he added. "The
anger and sadness are legitimate but must not translate into acts of
violence."
</P>
<P>
A first rampage broke out Thursday night after youths attacked firefighters
called in to help the two victims and a third youth who was later hospitalized
with serious burns.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said police denied having chased the two
youths and had arrived in the area to investigate an attempted
robbery.
</P>
<P>
State prosecutor Francois Molins, who is investigating the incident, said the
youths had fled police on the mistaken idea that they were being
pursued.
</P>
<P>
"The important element is what the third youth said," Molins told reporters.
"Some others began running and started saying that police were coming, and that
triggered the youths to flee."
</P>
<P>
"They thought they were being chased, when they weren't," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy has made cracking down on crime a priority. This week, he announced new
measures to deploy thousands of riot police to the country's toughest
neighborhoods and equip police night patrols with video cameras.

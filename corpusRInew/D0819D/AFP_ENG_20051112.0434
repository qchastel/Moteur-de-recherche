PARIS, Nov 13
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ban on public meetings imposed by the 
French government to avert fresh violence was expected to be lifted 
in Paris Sunday morning but youths clashed with riot police in the 
country's second city Lyon.
</P>
<P>
The Paris ban, which came into force at 10:00 am (0900 GMT) 
Saturday, lasts till Sunday at 8:00 am (0700 GMT) and prohibits "all 
meetings likely to start or fuel disorder."
</P>
<P>
No incidents were reported in Paris but police late Saturday 
said cars were set alight in the cities of Toulouse, in the south, 
as well as Lyon and the area of St. Etienne in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
Police said the situation in suburban areas throughout France 
was "much calmer" than on previous nights, with 315 vehicles torched 
by 4:00 am (0300 GMT) Sunday compared to 384 at the same time 
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A total 161 suspects were detained, against 162 at the same time 
the previous night.
</P>
<P>
During the 17th night of rioting two police officers were 
injured. One of them was hospitalized after being hit by a metal 
ball in the Paris suburb of La Courneuve.
</P>
<P>
Using emergency powers dating back to the time of the Algerian 
civil war, the government deployed more than 2,000 police and 
gendarmes in the capital after a series of Internet and text 
messages calling for violence were intercepted.
</P>
<P>
Acting under an ordinance that banned "all meetings likely to 
start or fuel disorder" police fanned out along main shopping 
streets and in the main railway stations. 
</P>
<P>
They were inspected on the Champs-Elysees by Interior Minister 
Nicolas Sarkozy, whose by now famous threat to power-hose the 
"rabble" in the racially-mixed Paris suburbs helped fuel a two-week 
nationwide orgy of rioting.
</P>
<P>
Paris has largely been spared the orgy of violence in suburbs 
around the capital and other cities, including the torching of 
thousands of cars and arson attacks on schools, kindergartens, 
gymnasiums and public buildings.
</P>
<P>
But for the first time Saturday afternoon, clashes between 
police and rioters erupted in the heart of a major French city, 
Lyon, where officers used teargas to disperse stone-throwing youths 
in the historic Place Bellecour in the city centre. 
</P>
<P>
By late evening it was reported that 11 youths had been arrested 
in Lyon, with nine kept in custody after two hours of clashes with 
police in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The number of car burnings also increased in Lyon with 24 cars 
set alight in what liked like a resurgence of violence in the 
southeastern city.
</P>
<P>
Lyon authorities ordered a 10:00 pm to 6:00 am (2100 GMT to 0500 
GMT) curfew in the city centre and 10 other localities for 
unaccompanied children under 16 for until Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Despite the emergency measures, police allowed peaceful 
demonstrations to go ahead, and several hundred people massed close 
to the police headquarters in the heart of Paris to protest 
"discrimination" against youths in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Many called for Sarkozy's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Another peaceful demonstration against the emergency laws was 
held in Toulouse. 
</P>
<P>
But car burnings began again in the southwestern city once the 
sun went down, with four vehicles going up in flames.
</P>
<P>
The violence, described as the worst in France since May 1968, 
erupted after the accidental deaths of two youths who were 
electrocuted in an electrical sub-station where they were hiding 
from police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the interior ministry announced that procedures are 
under way to expel foreign nationals convicted of rioting after the 
courts rejected an objection lodged by an anti-racist group.

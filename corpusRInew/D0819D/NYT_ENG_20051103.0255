RIOTING BY FRENCH-ARAB YOUTHS CONTINUES IN SUBURBAN PARIS

Angry French-Arab youths clashed with police and firefighters outside
Paris late Wednesday in the worst of seven consecutive nights
of violence set off by the accidental death of two
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
By late Thursday, more cars were burning in at least one
of the city's northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Gunshots were fired at police officers and firefighters in three separate
incidents Wednesday night, said Prefect Jean-Francois Cordet, the government's top
official in Seine-St.-Denis, a department north of Paris that includes
a belt of working-class neighborhoods with a large immigrant population.
</P>
<P>
In the clashes on Wednesday night, a police station was ransacked,
a garage was set on fire and a shopping center
and two schools were vandalized, Cordet said. Riot police forces
have used tear gas and rubber bullets to repel the
attacks.

<P>
Traffic was halted Thursday morning on a commuter rail line linking
Paris to Charles de Gaulle airport after stone-throwing rioters attacked
two trains. One passenger was slightly injured by broken glass,
according to local news reports. The violence picked up again
as night fell over the capital with burning cars reported
in the suburb of Stains.
</P>
<P>
Rampaging gangs have torched more than 200 cars in the past
week, and dozens of firefighters and police officers have been
injured, none seriously, since the deaths of two youths.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, who canceled a trip to Canada
this week because of the violence, urged citizens and the
police to restore order. "Law and order will have the
last word," he told senators on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The continuing violence has embarrassed the government and isolated the country's
tough-talking anti-crime interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, whom many people believe
exacerbated the situation with his vow to "clean out" the
troubled neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister's initiative has been met with scorn by many
people in the neighborhoods, who say they are being stigmatized
by his campaign and that the increased police presence has
resulted in harassment.
</P>
<P>
The latest violence began in the suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois a week
ago after two teenagers were electrocuted by a power transformer
while hiding from police. Local youths, who believed police had
chased the boys into the transformer's enclosure, took to the
streets, setting cars on fire in protest. A preliminary government
inquiry has since found that the youths were not being
pursued by the police.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the Interior Ministry on Thursday, stated that
a third boy who survived the incident said he and
his friends were aware of the danger when they entered
the transformer's enclosure. The report suggested that the boys were
hiding from the police because one of those who died
had a record of armed robbery and the other was
among a group that had broken into a construction site
earlier that evening.
</P>
<P>
The continuing unrest appears to be fueled less by perceived police
brutality than by the frustration of young men who have
no work and see little hope for the future.

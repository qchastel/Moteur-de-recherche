SEATTLE, Washington, Dec 24 (AFP)

<P>
The gubernatorial elections in Washington state and the US island of
Puerto Rico have finally ended, seven weeks after the close results
of their respective elections led to bitter political and legal
fights, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The more high-profile race in Washington state evoked memories of the
2000 presidential election quagmire in Florida, as a recount gave
Democrat Christine Gregoire a 130-vote lead over Republican contender
Dino Rossi.
</P>
<P>
Rossi had led the election by just 261 votes after the November 2
vote when 2.9 million voters cast their ballots, leading to an
automatic hand recount.
</P>
<P>
Rossi's lead shrank to 42 votes following the recount, but a new
review was ordered after authorities realized that 735 ballots from a
county around Seattle were never counted.
</P>
<P>
After the latest recount, Gregoire, the state's attorney general, led
by 130 votes.
</P>
<P>
"The election is over," Gregoire said.
</P>
<P>
But Rossi has refused to concede, reserving his right to challenge
the result in court. State law allows a challenge until January 20.
</P>
<P>
Washington's secretary of state, the state's top election official,
must certify the vote next week.
</P>
<P>
In the US commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Anibal Acevedo Vila of the
ruling Popular Democratic Party defeated former governor Pedro
Rossello by 3,228 votes, or 48.4 percent to 48.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The state's election commission will finish the recount Monday and
certify Acevedo Vila as the winner Tuesday in one of the island's
tightest elections.

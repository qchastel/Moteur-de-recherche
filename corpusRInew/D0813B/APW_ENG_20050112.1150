<P>
Democrat Christine Gregoire, winner of one of the closest governor's races in
U.S. history, was inaugurated Wednesday amid a legal challenge that could undo
her election.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire, 57, a scrappy three-term attorney general who took on the tobacco
industry and polluters, took the oath of office before a joint session of the
Legislature. Republicans had battled for weeks to delay her inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Backers of her Republican rival, Dino Rossi, continue to push for a whole new
election to decide the race.
</P>
<P>
Although the state is dependably Democratic, Gregoire narrowly lost the first
two vote counts. But when Democrats ordered one final hand recount, she pulled
ahead for the first time, winning by a minuscule 129 votes out of 2.9 million
ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
Republicans say widespread irregularities, including votes cast by felons and
dead people, spoiled the election to the point where it is impossible to truly
know who won.
</P>
<P>
Invoking a rarely used law that allows an election "contest," Republicans have
asked the courts to set aside the election and order a redo.

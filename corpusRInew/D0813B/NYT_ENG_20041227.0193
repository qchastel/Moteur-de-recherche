WASHINGTON: REPUBLICANS CRITICIZE RECOUNT

The head of the state Republican Party, Chris Vance, sharply criticized
ballot-counting procedures in King County, where a manual recount completed
last week nudged the Democratic candidate for governor, Christine O.
Gregoire, ahead of the Republican, Dino Rossi, by 130 votes.
It was the third count in the close race, and
the first time Gregoire had taken the lead. "We have
extreme concerns about the way King County conducted this election,"
Vance said, citing what the party claimed were illegally altered
ballots and changing standards for evaluating voter intent. Bobbie Egan,
a spokeswoman for King County Elections, responded, "We have followed
the letter of the law, and I think that's been
proven many times."

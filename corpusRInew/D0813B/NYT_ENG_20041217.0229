JUDGE KEEPS FOUND BALLOTS OUT OF VOTE FOR GOVERNOR

<P>
New ballots continued to pop up here in King County as the second
recount in the race for Washington governor descended into an
alphabet soup of intrigue and, in a neighboring county, a judge
issued a restraining order preventing King County from counting the
newfound ballots.
</P>
<P>
The fight over the new ballots began this week when a King County
councilman complained that his absentee vote had not been counted,
leading to the discovery of 573 absentee ballots that election
officials said had been rejected in error, including the
councilman's. On Friday morning, the number of newfound ballots grew
by 150 as King County announced it had failed to include in its
earlier count of 573 ballots those from voters whose last names began
with A, B and C. They were found tucked away in a cage holding all of
the county's ballots.
</P>
<P>
Because King County, which includes Seattle, is predominantly
liberal, the Democrats hope those 723 ballots can push their
candidate, Christine O. Gregoire, to victory.
</P>
<P>
The initial count after the Nov. 2 election had the Republican
candidate, Dino Rossi, ahead by 261 votes out of 2.9 million cast.
When the first recount, done by machine, ended last month, Rossi's
lead had shrunk to 42 votes.
</P>
<P>
The second statewide recount, done by hand, had Rossi leading by 50
votes as of Friday. King County, the state's most-populous county, is
the only one that has not completed the hand count.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon Judge Stephanie Arend of Pierce County Superior
Court ordered King County not to count the new ballots so the
Republican Party could gather more information on their origins.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans had gone to court in Pierce County, just south of
King County, because they wanted to ensure a fair hearing, said Chris
Vance, the state party chairman. State law allows plaintiffs suing
one county to be heard in a neighboring county for that reason.
</P>
<P>
This week the state Supreme Court said it would not force counties to
reconsider ballots they previously rejected if the counties chose not
to do so. King County elections officials had decided to review the
rejected absentee ballots, but Arend stopped them on Friday.

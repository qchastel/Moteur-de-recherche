GOVERNOR-ELECT DECLARED IN WASHINGTON RECOUNTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SEATTLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty-eight days after the election, Christine O. Gregoire was
declared the governor-elect of Washington on Thursday, the official
winner by an infinitesimal margin after two recounts in a
historically close race.
</P>
<P>
Far from conceding and bringing this long election to a close,
though, her Republican opponent, Dino Rossi, who earlier led in the
Nov. 2 election by 261 votes out of 2.9 million cast and was ahead in
the first recount by 42 votes, made it clear that he was not willing
to recognize that Washington now has a governor-elect. He indicated
that he was bound to contest the results but announced no specific
plans.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican who certified the results
of the final recount on Thursday, declaring Gregoire, a Democrat, the
winner by 129 votes, indicated that he did not expect things to end
here. Asked if he thought Gregoire would be inaugurated as scheduled
on Jan. 12, Reed, said: "I don't have enough information to be able
to make an educated guess. I'm not sure what's going to be brought
forward."
</P>
<P>
Reed said that while he believed in the accuracy of the election
results and had no reason to suspect fraud or misconduct, he said he
also believed that Rossi had the right to review the balloting for a
possible legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
Rossi, 45, a former state senator and wealthy real estate broker, had
sent Gregoire, 57, a letter on Wednesday evening asking her to join
him in requesting that the Democratic-controlled Legislature order a
new vote for governor. She refused, saying on Thursday that the most
accurate count of the three conducted was the hand count the
Democratic Party requested after an automatic machine recount gave
Rossi an edge of only 42 votes.
</P>
<P>
She said she was moving forward as the state's governor-elect.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire stopped short of asking Rossi to concede, saying: "I have
been called on many times to concede. It's up to Senator Rossi when
and if he will."
</P>
<P>
Gregoire, the state attorney general, had a gubernatorial air about
her at a televised news conference at the state legislative building
in Olympia as she congratulated her opponent for a campaign well run,
referred to statehouse reporters by their first names, tackled
questions about the budget and raising taxes and alluded to being
sworn in next month.
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to take the oath of office," she said. "Let us come
together as one Washington state."
</P>
<P>
Republicans, or any voter who wants to contest the results of the
final recount in court, have from now to 10 days after Gregoire is
sworn in to contest the election legally. Unless the Legislature
decides to issue Gregoire her "certificate of election" on another
date, Reed said, Republicans have until Jan. 22 to contest the
election.

Washington Dems Raise Funds for 3rd Recount

A month and a day after voters went to the polls, the
closest governor's race in Washington state history -- and one of the
nation's closest-ever statewide contests -- lurched forward Friday, as
state Democrats announced they had raised enough money to start a
third count, this one by hand, of nearly 3 million ballots.
</P>
<P>
The statewide hand recount is expected to take about two weeks and
seems certain to trigger court challenges from both Democrats and
Republicans. The Democratic Party said Friday it would ask the state
Supreme Court to rule that all ballots be counted under uniform rules
from county to county.
</P>
<P>
``We are going to count every vote in every county,'' said Paul
Berendt, chairman of the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
After the second count, Republican Dino Rossi led Democratic
Christine Gregoire by just 42 votes.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenally tight election appears to have motivated national
Democratic Party leaders -- stung by criticism of Al Gore's concession
in 2000 and Sen. John Kerry's concession last month -- to make sure
that the party not look weak-kneed when there is a legal avenue for
reversing an election's outcome.
</P>
<P>
The $730,000 down payment that will start a statewide recount came
from cash leftover in Kerry's presidential campaign, from the
Democratic National Committee and, in the past two days, from 15,000
smaller donations, many of them from individuals reached by Democracy
for America, an organization created by Howard Dean, the former
Vermont governor and presidential primary candidate.
</P>
<P>
``I am grateful and humbled by the outpouring of support for a hand
count of every vote,'' Gregoire said after learning her party had come
up with the money. ``With the election too close to call, a hand count
will finally determine the winner.''
</P>
<P>
The first machine vote count showed Rossi, 57, a self-made
businessman and former state senator who ran a strong campaign in this
Democrat-leaning state, ahead by 261 votes over Gregoire, 45, whose
three-terms as attorney general had made her a well-known name
statewide and who had been widely expected to win the election.
</P>
<P>
The second machine count, which was mandatory under state law,
whittled Rossi's winning margin down to just 0.0015 percent. By
comparison, George Bush's 539-vote victory over Al Gore in Florida in
2000 -- a margin of 0.0091 percent -- was robust.
</P>
<P>
When Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican, this week certified
Rossi as governor-elect -- a certification that by law allowed the
hand-count challenge announced here Friday -- he said the governor's
election was uniquely tight: ``We have checked with experts around the
nation, and nowhere has there ever been an election of this magnitude
that is this close.''
</P>
<P>
Exactly which ballots will now be recounted by hand is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
This week the Democratic Party sent a letter to Reed asking that
all ballots, including those disqualified in previous counts by county
canvassing boards, be included in the recount. Reed has said that only
votes counted in the first recount should be counted again.
</P>
<P>
According to Gregoire, state law allowing for a hand recount -- to
be supervised by observers from both parties -- was designed for just
this kind of cliffhanger election. Initially, Democrats wanted to only
recount Democratic-leaning King County near Seattle, but Gregoire said
it should be statewide.
</P>
<P>
``My request of the state Democratic Party is simple: count the
entire state or don't count at all,'' Gregoire said Thursday, when the
state Democratic Party was about $100,000 short of what it needed for
a down payment on the statewide recount.
</P>
<P>
If the recount reverses the outcome of the election, which many
Democratic Party leaders believe is likely, the state will pay for it
and Democrats will get their money back. The total cost of a recount
is expected to be about $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Rossi's campaign and the state Republican party leaders have been
saying for weeks that Gregoire should concede the election, for the
good of the state and so Rossi can get on with the preparatory work
for being governor.
</P>
<P>
But when reporters asked Rossi this week whether he would have
demanded a hand recount -- if he were behind by just 42 votes -- he
sidestepped the question.

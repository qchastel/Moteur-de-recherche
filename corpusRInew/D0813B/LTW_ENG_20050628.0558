Democrat Gregoire Is Certified as Gov.-Elect

<P>
One of the closest and most bizarre elections of any
state in U.S. history may have finally come to a close Thursday,
nearly two months after ballots were cast. Or maybe it didn't.
</P>
<P>
Democrat Christine Gregoire was certified Thursday as the
governor-elect, after losing two machine-read vote counts, but
prevailing in an unprecedented hand recount of the 2.9 million ballots
cast. Gregoire, the state attorney general, quickly convened a
post-election victory celebration with her family that winning
candidates usually throw within hours of the polls closing.
</P>
<P>
``An election night without end has concluded,'' Gregoire, 57, told
cheering supporters in Olympia, the state capital. ``And I am honored
to stand before you as governor-elect of the great state of
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
However, the angry Republican response was essentially:
Certification, schmertification.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire's opponent, former State Sen. Dino Rossi, vowed to
continue to contest the outcome, and he and his supporters also
stepped up calls for an extraordinary solution: a new vote entirely.
</P>
<P>
The confusing and downright wacky nature of the race was
highlighted Thursday when the two candidates held dueling public
events within a half an hour of each other.
</P>
<P>
Rossi went first, producing parents holding a photograph of their
son stationed in Fallujah, who, they said, received a ballot so late
that he threw it out, thinking it would not be counted. Democrats
disputed the assertion, but Rossi said it was evidence of an election
so ``muddied'' and botched that a new vote needed to be held.
</P>
<P>
``I wouldn't want to take office with this cloud overhead. I would
want a re-vote,'' said Rossi, 45, who last month had called on
Gregoire to concede when what he called the ``more accurate'' machine
recount had put him ahead by 42 votes.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire said the recount process had worked exactly as outlined in
state law, with the ``gold standard'' of a hand recount having
uncovered roughly 4,000 votes that for various reasons had gone unread
by the machines, as well as some absentee ballots that had been
wrongly disqualified. She dismissed the notion that a new election was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
``A do-over, to Mike and I, is only in golf,'' said Gregoire,
referring to her husband. ``We call it a mulligan. This is not golf.''
</P>
<P>
Gregoire was declared the winner Thursday by Secretary of State Sam
Reed, a Republican, putting him in the unusual position of having
certified both Rossi and Gregoire as governor-elect.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 24, Reed, following state election law, declared Rossi the
winner, by 42 votes, or a stunningly small 0.0015 percent of the vote.
But the Democrats, also following election law, demanded the hand
recount allowed for when a statewide margin is 150 votes or less.
</P>
<P>
It is that contentious process -- albeit one overseen by the
members of both major parties who make up county election boards --
that produced a different set of results, with Gregoire winning by 129
votes.
</P>
<P>
Reed said he believed the election was fair and not ``botched,''
but he did not declare it indisputably over.
</P>
<P>
``I would not say I think somebody ought to be conceding at this
point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
A new election would need authorization from the courts or the
Legislature -- where Democrats control both houses. The
constitutionality of another vote would surely be contested in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration is set for Jan. 12 and Republicans have hinted
they might boycott it.
</P>
<P>
If Gregoire is inaugurated, the event would mark a political
milestone: The first time any state would have a female governor and
two female U.S. senators.
</P>
<P>
The GOP moved quickly on several fronts Thursday to undermine
Gregoire's legitimacy, fighting for any leverage they can give Rossi
in his bid to become the first Republican governor here in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The powerful architect of several statewide anti-tax initiatives,
Tim Eyman, called on his supporters to ``bury Olympia'' with angry
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
``Tell them all that you demand a revote on the governor's race,''
Eyman wrote in an e-mail message. ``Tell them that they're kicking a
hornet's nest by rejecting your vote and your decision for governor.''
</P>
<P>
Other Republicans suggested Rossi supporters tie Ukrainian-style
orange ribbons around their car antennas. Democrats said the protest
was petulant.
</P>
<P>
Some election-law experts said Gregoire's victory would be less
than rock-solid until the state Supreme Court gets involved in the
certification issue.
</P>
<P>
The court's nine members are elected in non-partisan races. It did
essentially rule in Gregoire's favor earlier this month when it
ordered that roughly 500 previously uncounted absentee ballots in the
Democratic stronghold of King County be counted.
</P>
<P>
Those ballots, sealed in the inner envelopes a voter signs when
mailing in an absentee ballot, had been erroneously cast aside because
of a computer error.
</P>
<P>
Republicans protested, accusing King County of conducting a
partisan treasure hunt for votes, but Democrats noted that some more
Republican-friendly counties also turned up new ballots. Neither
Democrats nor Republicans objected to counting those votes.
</P>
<P>
While it's never happened in Washington state, a re-vote took place
in 1975 in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Senate race there came down to a two-vote difference between
the candidates, and in the ensuing legal fight, the two candidates
eventually agreed to a new vote, held 10 months after the first. The
Democrat won.
</P>
<P>
Invoking the tumultuous legal and political battle over the 2000
presidential contest in Florida, Gregoire said the manual recount had
amounted to an ``absolutely professional'' model for how a razor-close
election should be handled.
</P>
<P>
In Florida, a state court-ordered recount of the votes was halted
by the U.S. Supreme Court, leaving George W. Bush the winner.
</P>
<P>
``We worked together to ensure that votes were counted, problems
were revealed, mistakes were fixed,'' Gregoire said. ``We proved that
Washington state is not Florida, and now we move forward.''

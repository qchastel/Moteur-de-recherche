TRIAL FOR GOVERNOR'S SEAT SET TO START IN WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SEATTLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They still answer the phone "Rossi for Governor" at
the suburban office where Republican Dino Rossi runs the campaign
that has yet to die. And the candidate has hardly
been in exile -- making speeches, attending fundraisers and counting
the days until he gets his shot in court at
unseating the woman who beat him by 129 votes last
November.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be governor sooner or later," Rossi said. "I'm
working on sooner."
</P>
<P>
He may get his best chance starting Monday, when a two-week
trial is scheduled to begin before Judge John Bridges of
Chelan County Superior Court, in the apple country east of
the Cascade Mountains. Republicans have sued to overturn the results
of the gubernatorial election, which Christine Gregoire, the Democratic candidate,
won after two recounts and about 2.9 million ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
The trial will center on human and machine error in the
thinnest of margins: the 0.07 percent of the vote that
is being contested because felons or other illegal voters might
have cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
The judge has set a high bar before he will consider
throwing out the November results and ordering a new election,
or handing a victory to Rossi. The Republicans will have
to prove that Rossi received more votes than Gregoire, after
deducting hundreds of supposedly illegal votes, the judge has indicated.
</P>
<P>
It is a case that will pit one list of felons
against another; both sides have tallied hundreds of illegal voters.
But there is no way to know whom those people
voted for, short of calling them all to the witness
stand.
</P>
<P>
So while Republicans will argue that most of the felons voted
in the heavily Democratic King County, and therefore should be
deducted proportionally from Gregoire's total, the Democrats will counter with
their own experts who say that felons in the state
tend to vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
"The Republican base has always been nonunion, white, blue-collar males, and
that's who the felons are in the state of Washington,"
said Paul Berendt, chairman of the state's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
At the root of both arguments is an assumption that illegal
voters follow the same political pattern as legal voters --
a challenging legal proposition for throwing out an election, according
to election officials elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire said in an interview that if the courts were to
rule based on "guessing" which way voters would go because
of past patterns, it would set a dangerous precedent.
</P>
<P>
"If this type of argument is allowed to stand," she said,
"you would have no end to the challenges and trolling
for illegal votes after a close election. Elections would go
on and on and on."
</P>
<P>
Gregoire said she was confident of winning in court.
</P>
<P>
But Rossi was equally upbeat about his chances, even while acknowledging
that the proportional-analysis argument is not perfect.
</P>
<P>
"This is the closest we'll get to figuring out the intent
of these ballots," he said in an interview. "But if
you allowed illegal votes to stand, that would be worse."
</P>
<P>
Rossi also said the Republicans had done a better job of
finding people who should not have voted because their registrations
were never taken off the books after their criminal convictions.
</P>
<P>
"The difference between their felons and ours is we have all
the documentation," he said. "What you're going to see is
that a lot of their names won't stick once you
throw them up against the wall."
</P>
<P>
Republicans are also arguing that fraud occurred, pointing to errors made
in counting, sorting and certifying ballots in King County, which
includes Seattle. Democrats say errors are always a small part
of the election process and are not evidence of willful
fraud.
</P>
<P>
"The elections people have no idea how many people actually voted
in King County, but they say their tally is close
enough," said Chris Vance, chairman of the state's Republican Party.
"Well, excuse me, but close enough for government work doesn't
count in deciding who the governor is."
</P>
<P>
Rossi and Gregoire have been trying to buttress their images as
they wage their seemingly unending campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire, the former Washington State attorney general who led the states
in their legal settlement with the tobacco companies in the
late 1990s, has governed as if she had a big
mandate. The Legislature, which is controlled by the Democrats, passed
more bills this year than in any session in recent
history and raised gas taxes for $8.5 billion in transportation
projects.
</P>
<P>
"People have asked me if I would govern any differently if
I'd won by a million votes, and the answer is
no," Gregoire said. "There is nothing I can do about
the lawsuit, so I need to stay focused on the
business of the state."
</P>
<P>
Rossi has tried not to act like a governor in exile,
he said, and has rarely second-guessed Gregoire. A former real
estate investor and state senator, Rossi now works full time
trying to overturn the election. Until last week, he had
maintained a relatively low profile.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Polls show that Rossi's approval rating has risen, while Gregoire's has
fallen. And Rossi has been careful not to appear as
a sore loser, leaving it to Republican Party officials to
throw the sharpest punches.
</P>
<P>
Vance, for example, calls Gregoire "our fake governor."
</P>
<P>
In addition, conservative talk radio shows and the blogosphere are crowded
with critics who have hammered Gregoire while praising Rossi as
a victim of sloppy or criminal election processing.
</P>
<P>
But there is also considerable evidence that the public has grown
tired of the contested election and want to move on.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Elway, an independent pollster, said that his latest survey, of
400 registered voters in March, showed that a nearly two-to-one
majority wanted to accept the vote rather than hold a
new election. Elway's survey had a margin of error of
plus or minus five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
"In December, most people did not accept her as governor," Elway
said of Gregoire. "Now most people have, and they want
to move on."
</P>
<P>
Washington, like many states, is polarized between its Democratic urban centers
and Republican rural and suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
Leading up to this week's trial, Republicans have turned up the
heat on King County, trying to show that the Democratic-heavy
Seattle metro area has an incompetent elections divisions. Rossi has
enlisted the help of Slade Gorton, the former Republican senator
who was ousted by a narrow margin five years ago
by Maria Cantwell, primarily because of large Democratic turnout in
King County.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference, Gorton said King County "had the worst
election administration of any county in the United States."
</P>
<P>
But Democrats, who were once united in defending the county's election
operations, now say they plan to use evidence of mistakes
to help their case. They say that several hundred ballots,
which are likely to favor Gregoire, were never counted because
King County officials did not adequately try to verify them.
</P>
<P>
Berendt, the Democratic Party chairman, said, "We have a basic belief
that we're going to lay out in court that the
problems in King County hurt Gregoire more than they hurt
Rossi."

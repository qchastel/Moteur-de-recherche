JUDGE DISMISSES LAWSUIT OVER WASHINGTON ELECTION

<P>
Rejecting claims that fraud and illegal votes wrongly
put a Democrat in the governor's office, a judge in
this conservative area of eastern Washington dismissed a Republican lawsuit
on Monday that had sought to overturn the election of
Gov. Christine Gregoire.
</P>
<P>
The judge, John E. Bridges of Chelan County Superior Court, said
lawyers for the Republican candidate, Dino Rossi, had failed to
meet their burden of proof, providing no "clear and convincing"
evidence that illegal votes were responsible for Gregoire's 129-vote victory
over Rossi last year. It was the closest race in
the state's history.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence in this record that Ms. Gregoire received
any illegal votes," Bridges said in a ruling that had
been eagerly awaited by each side and seemed likely to
be appealed to the state Supreme Court. Bridges noted that
the only illegal votes that had been proved during the
trial were five cast by convicted felons; four were for
Rossi, and one was for a Libertarian candidate, Ruth Bennett.
</P>
<P>
Although Bridges cited widespread errors in the election, particularly in King
County, the state's most populous and liberal county, he said
it was plain that those human errors did not amount
to fraud. "There is no evidence that the significant errors
that occurred resulted from intentional misconduct or someone's desire to
manipulate the election," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling left Democrats euphoric.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire, in a statement, called the ruling "great news," and said
she hoped it meant that, almost five months after her
inauguration, "we can put this election behind us."
</P>
<P>
Other Democrats painted Rossi as a sore loser who had wasted
taxpayer time and money on a frivolous lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
"The Republicans never had a case," said Paul Berendt, the chairman
of the state Democratic Party. "There was no fraud, there
were no serious irregularities."
</P>
<P>
Berendt argued that the lawsuit was more about trying to burnish
Rossi's image at the expense of Gregoire. "They have shown
that they will say anything, they will spend anything and
they will do anything to tear down Christine, and that
needs to stop," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dale Foreman, a lawyer for the Republicans, rejected that accusation. "We
filed an election contest because we felt the election was
unfair," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the election, the more than 2.8 million ballots cast were
counted three times. The first two tallies gave Rossi a
victory by very small margins that shrank from one count
to the next, and the final count, conducted by hand,
put Gregoire in office.
</P>
<P>
Republicans claimed in court to have identified 754 votes cast by
felons, but they could not prove that even one had
cast an illegal ballot for Gregoire, largely, Foreman said, because
they did not interview the felons about which way they
voted.
</P>
<P>
Democrats did interview some of the felons, providing depositions from five
of them, including the four who said they voted for
Rossi.

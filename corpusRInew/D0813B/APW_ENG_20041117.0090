Washington calmly awaits new governor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks after the election, Washington state still doesn't have a
new governor. And voters are weathering the suspense the way Seattle
residents shrug off the rain.
</P>
<P>
"People in this part of the world tend to be rather pleasant. They
expect people to be civil in the way they behave," said Ken Hoover, a
political scientist at Western Washington University. "New York, this
isn't. That's why people like to live here."
</P>
<P>
The vote-counting is still going on. As of Tuesday night, Republican
real estate agent Dino Rossi led by just 19 votes out of 2.8 million
cast. Rossi had 1,367,365 votes to Democratic Attorney General
Christine Gregoire's 1,367,346.
</P>
<P>
Across the state, about 6,000 votes remained to be counted. Of the
four counties with the most votes outstanding, two favor Rossi and
two Gregoire.
</P>
<P>
Democrats scored a victory on Tuesday when a judge rejected the state
Republican Party's attempt to stop King County from counting hundreds
of provisional ballots. Party leaders sniped at one another, but even
their bickering conveyed a sense of superiority to other, messier
election dramas.
</P>
<P>
"We live in King County, not Broward County (Florida)," Seattle Mayor
Greg Nickels said. "Let's count every vote."
</P>
<P>
While protests broke out in Florida after the 2000 presidential
election, no angry mobs have stormed the county canvassing centers in
Washington _ not even slightly ticked-off mobs. People may be on the
edge of their seats, but they are sitting quietly and politely.
</P>
<P>
"Washington voters have come to expect to wait for returns," said
Bobbie Egan, King County elections spokeswoman. "Counting absentee
ballots just takes a long time."
</P>
<P>
Glacially slow vote-counting goes with the territory in Washington
politics.
</P>
<P>
In most states, mail-in ballots must be received by Election Day.
Washington and Alaska, however, require only that ballots be
postmarked by Election Day. With an estimated 60 percent of
Washingtonians voting by mail, close races can drag on for weeks as
absentee ballots trickle in to county offices.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 U.S. Senate race took several weeks of counting and
recounting before Democrat Maria Cantwell was declared the winner
over Republican incumbent Slade Gorton.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday is the deadline to finish counting, so Washington should
know who the next governor is by then. Unless, of course, there are
recounts.
</P>
<P>
Under state law, a recount must be held if the final margin of
victory is less than 2,000 votes. Six statewide vote recounts have
been conducted since 1968, though none of them changed the outcome.
</P>
<P>
Gregoire was heavily favored going into the race. If Rossi continues
trending upward, he could pull off a huge political upset and become
Washington's first Republican governor in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Some glitches have surfaced. Elections officials in Grays Harbor
County started recounting all 28,000 ballots Tuesday after
discovering a problem in the computer reporting system.
</P>
<P>
The pressure may be getting to some. Democratic State Party chairman
Paul Berendt wept openly after a judge ruled in favor of the party's
effort to track down 929 people whose provisional ballots were in
danger of being invalidated.
</P>
<P>
"We were just trying to get people their right to vote," he said. "It
meant a lot to me."
</P>
<P>
Outside the campaign headquarters, though, people are taking the
drawn-out election in stride.
</P>
<P>
"We're civilized enough out here. We have faith in our democracy,"
said Jean Wright, 44, a construction inspector in Olympia,
Washington's capitol city. "To have every vote counted, that's most
important to me." Still, she said, "I am dying to find out."

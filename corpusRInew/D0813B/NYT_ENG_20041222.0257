RECOUNT APPEARS TO REVERSE WASHINGTON GOVERNOR ELECTION

<P>
After a bitter and protracted recount fight in the Washington
governor's race, elections officials announced Wednesday that the
Democratic candidate, Christine O. Gregoire, was leading her
Republican opponent by 10 votes -- a minuscule margin but a stunning
reversal of the Nov. 2 election results.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results elated Democratic Party officials and came
only hours after the party scored another victory, when the state
Supreme Court agreed with the Democrats' contention that more than
700 newly discovered and erroneously disqualified ballots in heavily
Democratic King County should now be counted.
</P>
<P>
Since those ballots came from a county where Gregoire, 57, already
had a solid lead, the ruling could well allow her to increase her
extraordinarily tiny edge in a race that is the closest in state
history.
</P>
<P>
The day's events dealt a serious blow to state Republicans and Dino
Rossi, 45, a real estate executive and former state senator, who had
been certified the winner of the Nov. 2 vote after eking out a margin
of 261 votes out of almost 3 million cast. He later won a machine
recount by only 42 votes.
</P>
<P>
Official results from the manual recount will not be announced until
Thursday, after King County reviews the 723 disputed ballots.
Republicans, who fought hard to keep those ballots out of the tally,
were already vowing Wednesday to press election officials to consider
several hundred other disqualified ballots cast in other counties.
</P>
<P>
And whatever the final results, they are almost certain to be
contested.
</P>
<P>
"This count, this election, is not over," said Chris Vance, the
chairman of the state Republican Party. The Supreme Court, he said,
"basically threw the door open to start all over again. I think
that's crazy."
</P>
<P>
Vance said Republicans planned to "show up at 9 a.m." on Thursday "on
the doorstep of every county auditor with people whose votes weren't
counted for Dino Rossi."
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Gregoire, looking upbeat
for the first time since before the election, said she was not
personally asking Rossi to concede.
</P>
<P>
"I leave the decision about conceding to Mr. Rossi," she said. "I
have been called on many times to concede."
</P>
<P>
Gregoire steered clear of proclaiming victory. "It is too early to
declare victory," she said. "Although we are ahead right now, there
are still hundreds of votes left to be counted."

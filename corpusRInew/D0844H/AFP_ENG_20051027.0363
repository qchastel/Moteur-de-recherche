WASHINGTON, Oct 27
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Embattled President George W. Bush, 
acknowledging a serious political defeat, announced Thursday that 
his choice to fill a US Supreme Court vacancy, Harriet Miers, had 
withdrawn her nomination.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I have reluctantly accepted Harriet Miers's decision to 
withdraw her nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States," 
he said. "My responsibility to fill this vacancy remains. I will do 
so in a timely manner."
</P>
<P>
The move came as Bush languished at his worst level ever in 
public opinion polls and faced the possible indictment of senior 
aides in connection to a criminal investigation into the unmasking 
of a CIA agent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The court wields enormous influence over American life as the 
final arbiter of the US Constitution and ultimate court of appeal, 
and has ruled on issues like abortion, the death penalty and civil 
rights. Justices are named for life but can step down.
</P>
<P>
Bush had anointed Miers -- a longtime aide who serves as White 
House counsel, his official government lawyer -- on October 3 to 
replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
But the nomination immediately ran into trouble, with widespread 
accusations that the president had picked a crony, as well as a 
revolt from Bush's right-wing base supporters, who saw her as 
insufficiently conservative.
</P>
<P>
There was also a brewing battle between the Bush administration 
and the US Senate, which must confirm justices, over access to her 
legal writings at the White House and over whether Miers would have 
to answer questions about specific issues likely to come before the 
court.
</P>
<P>
The White House refused to provide the documents and insisted 
that Miers, who has never been a judge, would not answer any precise 
queries about her beliefs on volatile issues like abortion.
</P>
<P>
Miers, 60, will stay on as White House counsel and is expected 
to help the president choose his next nominee for the nine-seat US 
Supreme Court, according to Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
McClellan told reporters that Miers had telephoned Bush at 8:30 
pm Wednesday (0030 GMT Thursday) to let him know she was 
withdrawing, and formally offered him her resignation letter in the 
Oval Office 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, which was released by the White House, Miers said 
she was "concerned that the confirmation process presents a burden 
for the White House and our staff that is not in the best interest 
of the country.
</P>
<P>
"I have steadfastly maintained that the independence of the 
executive branch be preserved and its confidential documents and 
information not be released to further a confirmation process," she 
said.
</P>
<P>
Had she been confirmed, Miers would have joined Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the court and the third in its 
history.

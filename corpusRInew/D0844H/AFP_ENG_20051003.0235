<P>
US President George W. Bush has picked 
White House legal counsel Harriet Miers to be a new US Supreme Court 
justice, an administration official told AFP early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Miers, who was previously Bush's deputy chief of staff, has been 
picked to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her 
retirement in early July.
</P>
<P>
A formal announcement was expected at 1200 GMT Monday.
</P>
<P>
Miers will have to be confirmed by the US Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has been consulting with his aides and lawmakers on the 
issue over the past weeks, and White House spokesman Scott McClellan 
said Thursday the president "has been considering a diverse group of 
potential nominees." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier plans called for replacing O'Connor with federal judge 
John Roberts. But he was re-nominated to be US chief justice after 
the death of William Rehnquist in early September.
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who was sworn in as US chief justice last week, has his 
first day on the US high court on Monday.

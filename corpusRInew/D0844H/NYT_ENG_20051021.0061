EDITORIAL: WHAT'S UP WITH HARRIET MIERS?
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The chaos surrounding President Bush's Supreme Court nomination of Harriet Miers
gets curiouser and curiouser. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., ranking member
of the Senate Judiciary Committee, spoke for many Wednesday when
he said, "We'd actually like to know what the heck
is going on." Thank goodness Leahy and committee Chairman Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., are working in a bipartisan way to protect
the integrity of the Senate confirmation process and, ultimately, the
integrity of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
This nomination was in difficulty from the very start -- and
for the right reason: questions about Miers' qualifications. This is,
after all, a lifetime appointment to the country's highest court.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the challenge to Miers came from conservatives, who wanted a
nominee steeped in constitutional law and a firm believer in
hewing closely to the language in the Constitution. Miers has
never been a judge, and by all accounts has little
experience in constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
Bush sought to reassure at least the religious right by talking
about Miers' strong evangelical religious beliefs, implying that she could
be trusted to vote their way on culture-war issues, including
overturning Roe vs. Wade, the 1983 abortion ruling. Indeed, recent
news reports suggest the White House encouraged two judges in
Texas who know Miers to hold a conference call with
evangelical leaders in which the judges said flat out that
Miers would vote to overturn Roe. That rightly raised both
Republican and Democratic eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
But things just kept getting worse. First, Specter, who is a
very careful man, said Miers had endorsed the privacy concept
in Griswold vs. Connecticut, a landmark decision on which the
reasoning in Roe is based. But Miers denied she'd told
Specter that, leaving him dumbfounded and more than a little
miffed.
</P>
<P>
Finally came Miers' responses to a questionnaire sent her by the
Judiciary Committee. According to Leahy, members of the committee on
both sides of the aisle found the responses "inadequate," "insufficient"
and "insulting." Leahy and Specter asked her to do it
over, with greater emphasis on precision. As the New York
Times remarked, this amounted to "a do-over on a take-home
quiz."
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's Bush who needs a do-over. Leahy, Specter and their
colleagues in both parties now seem loaded for bear as
Miers' confirmation hearings approach, and that's a good thing. If
she comes out of those hearings looking as unqualified as
she looks going in, the committee should reject her and
ask Bush to send up another name.

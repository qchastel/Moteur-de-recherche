President Bush cites religion as a criterion for selecting Miers for high court

President George W. Bush said Wednesday that Harriet Miers' religious beliefs
figured into her nomination to the Supreme Court as a top-ranking Democrat
warned against any "wink and a nod" campaign for confirmation.

"People are interested to know why I picked Harriet Miers," Bush told reporters
at the White House. "They want to know Harriet Miers' background. They want to
know as much as they possibly can before they form opinions. And part of Harriet
Miers' life is her religion."
</P>
<P>
Bush, speaking at the conclusion of an Oval Office meeting with visiting Polish
President Aleksander Kwasniewski, said that his advisers were reaching out to
conservatives who oppose her nomination "just to explain the facts." He spoke on
a day in which conservative James Dobson, founder of Focus on Family, said he
had discussed the nominee's religious views with presidential aide Karl
Rove.

<P>
Not even a congressional recess nor Bush's preoccupation with hurricane recovery
and affairs of state shrouded the continuing controversy surrounding his
selection of Miers to replace the retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Debate
about Miers' credentials was prominent on the Sunday television talk shows and
has continued to occupy considerable attention on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Some of Bush's conservative critics say Miers has no judicial record that proves
she will strictly interpret the Constitution and not _ as Bush says _ "legislate
from the bench." They argue that Bush passed up other more qualified candidates
to nominate someone from his inner circle.

<P>
On a radio show being broadcast Wednesday, Dobson said he discussed Miers with
Rove on Oct. 1, two days before her nomination was announced. Dobson said Rove
told him "she is from a very conservative church, which is almost universally
pro-life," but denied he had gotten any assurances from the White House that she
would vote to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized
abortion.

<P>
Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said: "The rest
of America, including the Senate, deserves to know what he and the White House
know."
</P>
<P>
"We don't confirm Justices of the Supreme Court on a wink and a nod. And a
litmus test is no less a litmus test by using whispers and signals," the Vermont
senator said. "No political faction should be given a monopoly of relevant
knowledge about a nomination, just as no faction should be permitted to hound a
nominee to withdraw, before the hearing process has even begun."

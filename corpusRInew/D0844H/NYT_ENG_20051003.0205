BUSH NOMINATES HARRIET MIERS TO HIGH COURT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet
Miers on Monday for the U.S. Supreme Court, putting the
spotlight on a woman who has made a career out
of avoiding it.
</P>
<P>
"She has devoted her life to the rule of law and
the cause of justice," Bush said. "She will be an
outstanding addition to the Supreme Court of the United States."
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, Miers, a former Dallas lawyer, would replace Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement plans earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Miers, formerly Bush's personal lawyer, is now the White House counsel.
She came to Washington with Bush in 2001 as staff
secretary and became deputy chief of staff before becoming the
top White House lawyer when Alberto Gonzales became attorney general.
</P>
<P>
The announcement - which drew kind words from some Democrats and
skepticism from some conservatives - came just before Bush went
to the Supreme Court to watch Chief Justice John Roberts,
who won Senate confirmation last week, take the gavel.
</P>
<P>
The Miers nomination also drew charges by critics that Bush, again,
was turning to his insular world and tapping someone not
suited to the task. Moveon.org, which rallied against Bush in
the last election, called Miers another Bush "crony" riding his
coattails.
</P>
<P>
"Michael Brown taught us that vital national positions must be filled
with qualified candidates, not political friends with little experience," Eli
Pariser, the group's executive director, said, referring to the former
director of Federal Emergency Management Agency, a political appointee forced
out in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. "There is "no
information to indicate (Miers) meets the high bar necessary for
the next justice on the Supreme Court."
</P>
<P>
But Bush said that Miers' lack of judicial experience is a
positive. He noted that late Chief Justice William Rehnquist was
one of more than 30 justices whose first judicial service
came on the high court.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud to nominate an outstanding woman who brings a similar
record of achievement in private practice and public service," Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats agreed. New York Sen. Charles Schumer said that "somebody
whose experience is practical and real world is good" for
the court.
</P>
<P>
As White House counsel, Miers played a lead role in Bush's
judicial selections, including his pick of Roberts. In recent weeks,
she moved from head of the search committee to candidate
in a process that ended when Bush offered her the
job at a White House dinner Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The process harkened back to when Dick Cheney, head of Bush's
search for a running mate in 2000, wound up as
the running mate.
</P>
<P>
"I am very grateful for the confidence in me that you
have shown by this nomination," Miers told Bush Monday, "and,
certainly, I am humbled by it."
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, the court's first female, has often been the moderate swing
vote on a sharply divided court. Her replacement also could
become a pivotal vote.
</P>
<P>
Bush praised Miers' frequent "first woman" accomplishments and pronounced her his
kind of justice.
</P>
<P>
"Harriet Miers will strictly interpret our Constitution and laws," Bush said
in the Oval Office. "She will not legislate from the
bench."
</P>
<P>
He also recalled he had appointed Miers to head the Texas
Lottery Commission during a series of scandals in the 1990s,
an era that included a lawsuit by a former lottery
director who said officials protected a lottery contractor with information
about how Bush got into the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
"When I came to office as the governor of Texas, the
Lottery Commission needed a leader of unquestioned integrity," Bush said.
" I chose Harriet because I knew she would earn
the confidence of the people of Texas."
</P>
<P>
In accepting the nomination, Miers professed "great respect and admiration for
the genius that inspired our Constitution and our system of
government."
</P>
<P>
"The wisdom of those who drafted our constitution and conceived our
nation as functioning with three strong and independent branches have
proven truly remarkable," Miers said. "It is the responsibility of
every generation to be true to the founders' vision of
the proper role of the courts in our society."
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Miers has served Bush in a variety of private,
political and government roles. Most have been done in a
way that does not shed much light on her judicial
or political philosophy.
</P>
<P>
It's a career-in-the-shadows background that has both ends of the political
spectrum looking for answers as the process moved toward confirmation
hearings the White House would like completed by Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
Curiously, many of the nicer initial words came from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
"I like Harriet Miers," said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.,
who had recommended her to Bush.
</P>
<P>
"My first reaction is a simple one: It could have been
a lot worse," said Schumer.
</P>
<P>
"The president has not sent us a nominee who has already
hewed to the extreme wing of his party," Schumer said,
crediting Bush for realizing "that the views of the extreme
right wing of his party aren't the views of the
American people, or even close to it."
</P>
<P>
But in Miers, as with Roberts, Bush "sent us a nominee
who we really don't know that much about."
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Miers for over an hour, Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Penn., said, "Everything I know about Ms.
Miers is good, but I do not know a great
deal about her professional activities or her academic standing or
her work in her legal career, which appears to be
a very distinguished career."
</P>
<P>
From the right, the doubts came from the movement's leading radio
voice. During an interview with Vice President Cheney, Rush Limbaugh
noted that President Clinton "chose liberals that were liberals without
question, card-carrying ACLU members."
</P>
<P>
Limbaugh said the Miers nomination "has some people scratching their heads
because we've seemed to pick a nominee here that is
oriented in some way to placating Democrats."
</P>
<P>
Conservative columnist Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, said the
choice demoralized conservatives.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like he capitulated," Kristol said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
Cheney, on Limbaugh's show, defended the choice and said Bush, in
appointing Roberts and Miers, has "done more to change the
court ? than any of his predecessors in modern times."
The vice president disagreed "with the notion that something this
is an effort to appease the left."
</P>
<P>
Despite the assurances from the White House, several conservative groups came
out swinging against Miers. Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue,
an anti-abortion rights group, noted that "some" have put Miers
in the same category with "pro-abortion administration officials Condoleezza Rice
and Karen Hughes."
</P>
<P>
"We must be given a nominee that will restore the protections
of personhood to the pre-born. If your head was about
to be crushed, would you want to trust you life
to someone who will not state their position on your
murder? Newman said.
</P>
<P>
Miers' position on abortion is unknown. The closest she has come
to public involvement in that controversy came in 1993 when
she played a leading role in challenging the American Bar
Association's support for abortion rights. Miers, without voicing a position
on abortion, called for a referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Specter, an abortion rights advocate, said that episode offered no insight
on Miers' position.
</P>
<P>
"I believe more precisely she took the position that the American
Bar Association should not take a position on Roe," Specter
said. "I'm sure that will be the subject of inquiry,
and I would expect to go into that right at
the start, to put on the record exactly what those
facts are."
</P>
<P>
Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, which opposes abortion
rights, expressed doubts about Miers. Perkins recalled that Bush has
said his nominees "would be in the mold of current
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas."
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to believe he has abandoned that standard,"
Perkins said. "However, our lack of knowledge about Harriet Miers,
and the absence of a record on the bench, give
us insufficient information from which to assess whether or not
she is indeed in that mold. In the days to
come, Harriet Miers will have the chance to demonstrate such
a philosophy."
</P>
<P>
(Optional add begins)
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Miers said it's a question Supreme Court nominees should
not even be asked.
</P>
<P>
In February 1992, serving on an ABA convention panel in Dallas,
Miers was asked whether a president looking for a Supreme
Court nominee should ask how potential nominees about how he
or she would vote in abortion cases.
</P>
<P>
"Nominees are clearly prohibited from making such a commitment and presidents
are prohibited from asking for it," said Miers, then the
president-election of the State Bar of Texas.
</P>
<P>
Miers added that anybody who believes that line of inquiry is
proper displays "a misunderstanding of the separation of powers by
proposing that judicial nominees should mirror a president's views."
</P>
<P>
(Optional add ends)
</P>
<P>
Despite the initial kind words about Miers from Democrats, both sides
are anticipating a battle over the release of White House
documents that could shed light on her philosophy.
</P>
<P>
"Given how little we know about this nominee other than her
work as the President's lawyer, the White House needs to
disclose all documents requested by the Judiciary Committee, and Ms.
Miers needs to explain her thoughts on constitutional interpretation," said
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
Specter indicated little of that material would be released, noting that
much of Miers' White House work since coming to Washington
with Bush is covered by executive privilege and attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, "I expect the liberal left to
make demands upon the administration to produce information protected by
attorney-client privilege. Efforts such as these to derail a qualified
nominee like Miers should fail."
</P>
<P>
The White House took no official position on the release of
documents.
</P>
<P>
"Let's let those requests come in and then we will be
glad to talk about it," McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
Like some of the groups on the right, left-leaning groups said
they need to know much more about Miers.
</P>
<P>
"With no past judicial experience for the senators to consider, the
burden will be on Miers to be forthright with the
Senate and the American people," Neas said. "She must outline
her judicial philosophy and provide direct answers to questions about
how and whether she will uphold fundamental rights, liberties and
legal protections on which Americans rely."

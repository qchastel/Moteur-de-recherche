Conservatives urge Bush to withdraw Supreme Court nominee Miers

<P>
Conservative outrage over President 
George W. Bush's controversial pick of Texas lawyer Harriet Miers to 
fill a vacancy on the US Supreme Court was unabated Sunday as 
activists called on the White House to withdraw her nomination.
</P>
<P>
Among the most outspoken detractors was former presidential 
candidate Pat Buchanan, who, on NBC television's "Meet the Press" 
program, said Bush should name someone else to fill the vacancy on 
the US high court.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see the nomination withdrawn. If I were in the 
Senate today I would vote against it," Buchanan said. "My guess is, 
she will not be confirmed, and she will be withdrawn."
</P>
<P>
The Weekly Standard, a bible for dyed-in-the-wool conservatives, 
on Sunday called the choice of Miers "at best an error, at worst a 
disaster" which should be reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
"He has put up an unknown and undistinguished figure for an 
opening that conservatives worked for a generation to see filled 
with a jurist of high distinction," the magazine's editor Bill 
Kristol wrote.
</P>
<P>
"The best alternative would be for Miers to withdraw," the 
conservative pundit said. "Her nomination has hurt the president 
whom she came to Washington to serve."
</P>
<P>
Conservatives have been harshly critical of Bush's choice of 
Miers, fearing the president may have blown the best chance in 
decades for Republicans to move the high court -- the arbiter of 
legal disputes on a wide range of hot-button social issues -- 
definitively to the right.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, Miers would fill the seat of retiring Justice 
Sandra Day O'Connor, who was the first woman to serve on the Supreme 
Court and often a critical swing vote on the nine-member panel.
</P>
<P>
Miers, 60, currently is White House counsel, and served as 
Bush's personal attorney when he was governor of Texas. Her opinions 
on abortion and other burning issues are largely unknown and staunch 
conservatives have said they would have preferred a candidate whose 
views were clear.
</P>
<P>
Bush's rightwing supporters are further miffed that in choosing 
Miers, an old friend and longtime aide, the president passed over 
several better-known, better-qualified conservative candidates.
</P>
<P>
The distrust among conservatives is even greater because of a 
decision in 1990 by Bush's father, president George H.W. Bush, to 
nominate David Souter to the US high court.
</P>
<P>
Souter originally was thought to be a bedrock conservative, but 
in many key Supreme Court votes, he has sided with liberals.
</P>
<P>
Gleeful Democrats -- who have been enjoying the spectacle of 
Republicans battling amongst themselves -- have expressed relief 
that Bush appears to have avoided a major battle by nominating 
someone without an avowedly extremist agenda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, moderate Republicans have stuck by the president, at 
least outwardly, and decried the rush to dismiss Meirs.
</P>
<P>
"What you've had here on Harriet Miers is not a rush to 
judgment. It's a stampede to judgment.  She's faced tough -- one of 
the toughest lynch mobs ever assembled in Washington," said Arlen 
Specter, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
speaking on ABC television.
</P>
<P>
"She's intelligent, she's hard-working, unquestioned integrity. 
She fought her way up, couldn't get a job when she graduated from 
law school because she was a woman," Specter said in Miers's 
defense.
</P>
<P>
But he indicated there was some cause to worry about the 
qualifications of Miers, who has never served as a judge.
</P>
<P>
"When you deal in constitutional law, you're dealing in some 
very esoteric complicated subjects that require a great deal of 
background," Specter said. "And that kind of background doesn't come 
unless you are in the field or unless you're really studying it."
</P>
<P>
Bush on Saturday sought to reassure conservatives, saying in his 
weekly radio address that Miers was a solid conservative who would 
not drift to the left if seated on the high court.
</P>
<P>
"I chose Harriet Miers for the court both because of her 
accomplishments, and because I know her character and her judicial 
philosophy. Harriet Miers will be the type of judge I said I would 
nominate -- a good conservative judge," Bush said.

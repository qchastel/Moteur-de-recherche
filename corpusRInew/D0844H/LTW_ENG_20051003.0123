Miers Nomination Draws Full Range of Reactions

<P>
President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers for the
Supreme Court splintered the Republican Party's conservative base,
with reaction from key senators and groups ranging from hostility to
silence to praise.
</P>
<P>
Several right-leaning lawmakers and activists seemed bewildered by
the choice of a relatively little-known White House counsel who has
given money to Democratic candidates and who was recommended for the
job by Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. While numerous senators
urged colleagues to withhold judgment until more is known, some
outsiders vented their dismay that the president had not chosen
someone with unmistakably conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
``I know of nothing in Harriet Miers' background that would qualify
her for an appointment to the Supreme Court,'' said Roger Pilon,
founder of the libertarian Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional
Studies. William Kristol, editor of the influential conservative
magazine Weekly Standard, summarized his reaction as ``disappointed,
depressed and demoralized.''
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, which will confirm or reject Miers this fall, the
nomination triggered a mixture of praise and reserve that, on balance,
seemed to bode well for her confirmation, veteran staffers said. The
acclaim she received from GOP leaders was expected, they said. Less
predictable were the accolades from Reid, the Democratic leader, and
several conservative Republicans on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
``My conversations with Harriet Miers indicate that she is a
first-rate lawyer and a fine person,'' said Sen. Jeff Sessions.
R-Ala., one of the committee's most conservative members. ``Her legal
skills are proven and her reputation throughout the legal community is
excellent.'' Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), another committee Republican,
said Bush ``has made a solid pick for the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
But two other committee conservatives withheld judgment. Sen. Tom
Coburn, R-Okla., issued a two-sentence statement saying Miers
``deserves a fair and thorough hearing and confirmation process. I
look forward to learning more about her qualifications and judicial
philosophy.'' Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., made no public comments
despite several media requests.
</P>
<P>
The praise from Reid, who voted against Chief Justice John
Roberts's confirmation last month, turned heads in both parties. ``I
have to say without any qualification that I'm very happy that we have
someone like her,'' Reid told reporters as he greeted Miers in the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., said Reid had ``recommended her nomination to the president''
in a White House meeting two weeks ago. Reid spokesman Jim Manley said
the Democratic leader had ``urged the president to consider'' Miers.
</P>
<P>
Miers's supporters tried to appease conservatives by releasing
information suggesting she opposes abortion rights. Publicist Keith
Appell issued a statement saying, ``According to Kyleen Wright at
Texans for Life, Harriet Miers gave $150 to the organization -- then
known as Texans United for Life -- in 1989. Miers was a bronze patron
for their annual dinner in which Henry Hyde was the keynote speaker.''
Hyde, a U.S. House member from Illinois, is a leading opponent of
legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
Wright confirmed the contribution Monday, but said, ``I'm not sure
it says anything one way or the other.'' Wright said most of the
roughly two dozen bronze contributors were candidates, and Miers at
the time was on the Dallas City Council.
</P>
<P>
Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, issued a
statement expressing the ambivalence of several groups on the right.
``President Bush has long made it clear that his choices for the U.S.
Supreme Court would be in the mold of current justices Antonin Scalia
and Clarence Thomas,'' Perkins said. ``We have no reason to believe he
has abandoned that standard. However, our lack of knowledge about
Harriet Miers, and the absence of a record on the bench, give us
insufficient information from which to assess whether or not she is
indeed in that mold.''
</P>
<P>
Gary Bauer, 2000 presidential candidate and president of American
Values, said ``the future of the Supreme Court is too important to
leave to chance.''
</P>
<P>
In private, some conservative leaders voiced concern that Miers
could become ``another David Souter,'' the Supreme Court justice
picked by President Bush's father who has turned out to be a reliable
member of the court's liberal wing. They pointed to her 1988
contributions to Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign, the
re-election campaign of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and the
Democratic National Committee. The 1988 Democratic Platform endorsed
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
Some groups on the right flatly opposed Miers's confirmation
Monday. ``We must reject the nomination of Harriet Miers to the
Supreme Court, said Troy Newman, president of the anti-abortion-rights
group Operation Rescue. ``Miers is no Thomas or Scalia.''
</P>
<P>
Two prominent conservatives, however, endorsed Miers, including
American Center for Law and Justice Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow, who has
become a close White House ally. James Dobson of Focus on the Family
said, ``We welcome the president's nomination. ... (Bush) promised to
select competent judges who will 'not use the bench to write social
policy.' ... We believe that she will not prove to be a lone
exception.''
</P>
<P>
Almost unanimously, leaders on the left said senators must press
Miers to make explicit her judicial philosophy and her stands on the
right to privacy and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
``If she is confirmed, Harriet Miers may cast the deciding vote in
cases that will determine whether women and minorities have equal
opportunity in education and the workplace, whether we can be free and
equal members of society, and whether we can make our personal and
private family decisions without government intrusion,'' said Debra
Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women  Families.
``Senators have a duty to ask probing questions and learn Miers's
views before voting on her nomination.''
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the liberal Alliance for Justice said: ``Ms. Miers
must prove that she can put her years of service to President Bush and
powerful corporate interests behind her and be an independent voice on
the court. The burden is on Harriet Miers to demonstrate her fitness
for a seat on the Supreme Court to the Senate and the American people.
There is a tremendous amount at stake. Our rights and liberties hang
in the balance.''

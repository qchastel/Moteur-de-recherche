DOUBTS ABOUT MIERS (FOR USE

<P>
DOUBTS ABOUT MIERSTHANKS TO her friends in the White House, Harriet
Miers will face the Senate Judiciary Committee bearing a greater
burden than John Roberts, now the chief justice of the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Roberts, as a protégé of his predecessor, William Rehnquist, had strong
conservative and legal credentials, so his handlers from the Bush
administration bristled when some liberal groups began to question what
role his Roman Catholic upbringing and faith might play on
the court. Religion is not relevant to the appointment, they
said.
</P>
<P>
But Miers has few credentials of any kind to carry into
her confirmation hearings, expected to begin next month. So Bush
and his minions have tried to reassure skeptical conservatives by
pointing to her religious beliefs. Though raised a Catholic, Miers
is now an evangelical Protestant whose commitment to her faith
is portrayed by supporters as deep-seated and steadfast. "Part of
Harriet Miers's life is her religion," Bush said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Miers is smart enough to tell senators that her views and
actions on the bench would be based on the Constitution
and not religious scripture. But there will doubtless be a
focus on religion in her hearings, in large part because
of Bush's effort to have it both ways. Asked for
Miers's judicial philosophy, the White House has given us the
worldview of James Dobson, founder of the archconservative group Focus
on the Family. Dobson's support for Miers was solicited by
Bush's aide Karl Rove even before Bush introduced her to
the country, showing what constituency is most important to this
administration.
</P>
<P>
So senators will likely put Miers on the spot to extricate
herself credibly from a tangle of religious implications that now
threatens to become more of a trap than a safety
net. Beyond that, senators will rightly press Miers for evidence
of her ability to think independently and powerfully on constitutional
issues. Roberts was not well known before his nomination, but
what experience he had was gold-plated: clerking for Rehnquist; a
reputation as one of the most effective advocates before the
Supreme Court; and two years on the top federal appeals
court. And Roberts backed this up with an impressive grasp
and articulation of constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
Miers has no such experience. Liberals worry, understandably, that she might
be a lapdog for Justice Antonin Scalia, showing the same
kind of loyalty to Bush's favorite judge as she has
to Bush himself. But it would not be much better
if she were a lapdog for a more moderate or
liberal judge. In the long run, the Supreme Court needs
strong, independent minds.
</P>
<P>
It will be up to Miers to show senators, and the
nation, that she would not be beholden to Bush or
Scalia or any other influence, including the Bible.

Was It the Concern About the Concern?

Not two hours after the White House withdrew Harriet
Miers's Supreme Court nomination Thursday morning, Trent Lott,
R-Miss., walked out of the Senate chamber with a spring in his step.
</P>
<P>
``I raised red flags the first day,'' the senator from
I-told-you-so said. Asked if there was a sense of relief in the
Republican caucus, Lott paused, smiled and, in his barbershop-quartet
bass, sang out to disbelieving reporters: ``Happy Days Are Here
Again!''
</P>
<P>
Senators came to bury Miers Thursday, not to praise her.
Republicans blamed the withdrawal on demands for White House
documents. Democrats blamed right-wing ideologues. But few seemed
distraught that the nation would be spared the equivalent of a
televised bar exam before the Senate Judiciary Committee next month.
</P>
<P>
As is customary, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., was first to the
microphones. The first bulletins on Miers crossed the wires at 8:54
a.m. At 9:32 a.m. Schumer announced a news conference -- for 10 a.m.
``Harriet Miers is a fine and capable person, but this was clearly the
wrong position for her,'' he announced.
</P>
<P>
Sen. George Allen, R-Va., was not far behind, at 10:22. ``I
appreciate Harriet Miers's decision to withdraw,'' the conservative
said.
</P>
<P>
The ostensible reason for the withdrawal -- what Miers called
``protection of the prerogatives of the Executive Branch'' from
senators' demands for White House documents -- fell apart instantly.
</P>
<P>
``It wasn't only the documents,'' Miers's White House-assigned
shepherd, former senator Dan Coats, R-Ind., told reporters outside the
Senate chamber. ``Obviously you hope for unanimous support from your
base when the president nominates someone, and that was lacking, as
you know. There were legitimate questions being asked about her
background because she didn't have a paper trail.''
</P>
<P>
Then there was the prospect of a week of grilling by the Judiciary
Committee. ``She was,'' Coats added, ``doing very well in her trial
preparations.''
</P>
<P>
Trial?
</P>
<P>
``Freudian slip,'' the shepherd explained.
</P>
<P>
It's understandable that Coats would be off message: Miers told
Bush last night that she was dropping out, but nobody bothered to tell
Coats. ``I got up this morning looking forward to more
consultations,'' he said. ``When I arrived at the White House early,
we went into a private office, and we had a discussion.''
</P>
<P>
Reporters, expecting a routine day on the Hill, rushed to the
Senate chamber in the morning for an otherwise unremarkable vote on a
labor spending bill. A trio of Judiciary Committee Republicans -- Jeff
Sessions of Alabama, Mike DeWine of Ohio and John Cornyn of Texas --
gave impromptu news conferences.
</P>
<P>
Sessions was not distraught. ``I was concerned about the, uh,
concern,'' he said. ``Probably she was worried about (it), too.''
</P>
<P>
Cornyn, Miers's friend and most ardent Senate supporter, insinuated
that the Democrats were to blame. ``I would just say it's part of
unnecessary contentiousness and partisanship,'' he argued. When a
questioner pointed out that the objections came primarily from
Republicans, Cornyn turned angrily. ``There is no Republican senator
who opposed the nominee,'' he said. ``Your statement was wrong!''
</P>
<P>
The growls subsided when Cornyn, an hour later, was asked at
another news conference about the possibility that he could be
nominated to the high court. ``Well, you know, if the president calls
me, obviously I'll answer the phone or go see him, if he invites me to
come to the White House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Democrats, though they never committed to supporting Miers, lined
up to blame the ``right wing'' (John Kerry), ``the far right wing''
(Byron Dorgan), ``extreme right wing'' (Dick Durbin), ``extreme
partisan pressure'' (Mary Landrieu) and ``extremists'' (Ted Kennedy).
</P>
<P>
The Democrats got some help making this point from Judiciary
Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who made a terse statement on the
Senate floor. Specter -- the man who suggested the nominee needed a
``crash course in constitutional law'' -- lamented the ``one-sided
debate'' and the ``heavy decibel level against her.''
</P>
<P>
Rebutting the White House line, Specter argued that ``the Judiciary
Committee carefully did not intrude on the president's executive
privilege.'' His three-minute statement over, Specter left the chamber
through a back door, evading the scrum of reporters waiting to ambush
him.
</P>
<P>
Lott, the Senate Republican leader Bush helped to dethrone, was
happy to talk. And he didn't have anything nice to say. On Bush's
nominees: ``I'm not going to just roll over and take everything he
sends up here.'' On Bush's consultations: ``I don't think he got
enough advice from the right people.'' On Attorney General Alberto
Gonzales for the court: ``Forget that!''
</P>
<P>
Asked why Bush chose Miers, Lott replied: ``There is Federalist
Paper number 76. I invite your attention to it: Be careful about home
state, personal friends, cronyism.''
</P>
<P>
Lott had more to say. He branded Bush's aides ``all young and
inexperienced'' and said senators had nobody to call at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
``Karl Rove can't do it all by himself,'' Lott said. Then a
mischievous grin crossed the senator's face, and, alluding to the CIA
leak case, he added: ``And he may not be there.'' Theatrically, Lott
brushed his hands as if wiping off dust.

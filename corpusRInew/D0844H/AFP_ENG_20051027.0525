<P>
Conservatives on Thursday expressed 
relief that Harriet Miers has withdrawn as President George W. 
Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court, while liberals fretted that the 
White House might replace her with a more right-leaning candidate.
</P>
<P>
Democrats -- who for the past few weeks mostly remained on the 
sidelines as Miers's troubled nomination ran further and further 
aground in Congress -- blamed conservative partisans for her 
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"The President has allowed right wing interest groups to decide 
the fate of his Supreme Court nominee, rather than stand up to his 
ultra-conservative base," Democratic Senator John Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
"Its a telling statement about the instability and ideological 
confusion facing the White House and the Republican Party," Kerry 
said.
</P>
<P>
Another top Senate Democrat, Charles Schumer also blamed 
activism by "the very extreme wing of the president's party," and 
expressed hope that Bush would withstand conservative pressure in 
making his next pick to the court.
</P>
<P>
"If the president continues to listen to that extreme wing, on 
judicial nominations or everything else, it can only spell trouble 
for his presidency and for America," Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
Bush picked Miers, a longtime aide and currently White House 
counsel, on October 3 to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice 
Sandra Day O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
Some critics have noted that she has no experience in matters of 
constitutional law and that she might not have had full command over 
the issues at play in a wide array of legal cases she would have 
been called upon to hear.
</P>
<P>
Right wing partisans were even more concerned that Miers was not 
sufficently conservative on social issues like abortion, however, 
and expressed relief Thursday at her withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"We're just happy it's over," prominent conservative commentator 
Ann Coulter jubilantly told US television.
</P>
<P>
Conservative senator Jeff Sessions, who also applauded the 
decision to withdraw Miers, said prospects for her confirmation had 
not appeared promising.
</P>
<P>
"She would have had a lot of tough questions and the hearings 
would have been quite a challenge," the Republican lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
Some said Miers's nomination might have been doomed as much by 
White House bungling as conservative activism.
</P>
<P>
"This nomination was mishandled from the beginning," Kerry said. 
"If the president really believed Harriet Miers was the most 
qualified candidate for the Supreme Court, he made a terrible 
mistake refusing to fight for her and capitulating to the right 
wing."
</P>
<P>
Conservative Senator Trent Lott meanwhile agreed that there had 
been insufficient legwork by the White House leading up to the 
announcement of Miers's nomination.
</P>
<P>
"If they'd have bothered to check with some of their friends up 
here, they'd have said, 'Wait, wait, we're not sure about this 
nominee's qualifications. Are you sure you want to do that?'"
</P>
<P>
Right wing commentator Bay Buchanan meanwhile, said the 
president now has the opportunity to salvage his reputation with 
conservatives by nominating a mainline rightwing partisan for the 
post.
</P>
<P>
"If he turns around with another Harriet Miers, he's going to 
turn a revolt into a revolution," she said.
</P>
<P>
But Schumer said he hoped the president now would make a clear, 
mainstream choice for the post whom both Democrats and Republicans 
could rally around.
</P>
<P>
"There is now one clear path for the president, to choose a 
knowledgeable and mainstream successor.
</P>
<P>
"These are very difficult times for the country and the nation 
cries out for unity," Schumer continued, in a direct appeal to 
Bush.
</P>
<P>
"Mr President, this is a time for leadership. Please help bring 
America together with a choice that unites, not divides us."

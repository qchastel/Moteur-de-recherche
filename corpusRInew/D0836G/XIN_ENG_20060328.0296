Thailand's hospital in northern 
Nan province discharged 12 more botulism patients Tuesday, 
reducing the number of people still hospitalized with the rare and
potentially fatal illness to 44, local media said.

Of those 44, seven remain in intensive care.

"All of the inpatients are recovering satisfactorily," said 
Public Health Ministry acting permanent secretary Prat 
Boonyawongvirot.

On March 14, 163 people were hospitalized with botulism after 
eating bamboo shoots contaminated with clostridium botulinum toxin
at a meritmaking ceremony. Clostridium botulinum is so dangerous 
and volatile it could potentially be used as a biological weapon.

Nan public health chief Pisit Sriprasert said academics from 
the Medical Sciences Department and the Disease Control Department
had collected samples of the preserved bamboo shoots Monday to 
study how the clostridium botulinum had developed.

<P>
"Our research findings will help prevent another outbreak of 
this disease," he said.

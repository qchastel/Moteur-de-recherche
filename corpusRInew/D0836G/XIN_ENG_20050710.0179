To help Nigeria revitalize 
agriculture, the Chinese government has sent 393 experts in 
agriculture and related disciplines to provide assistance to 
farming communities across the West African country, a Nigerian 
official has said.

<P>
Salisu Ingawa, project coordinator of Nigeria's National 
Special Program for Food Security (NSPFS), told reporters at the 
weekend at a one-day seminar for sensitization of stakeholders on 
bamboo development and utilization that the partnership between 
Nigeria and China in the area of agriculture was in keeping with 
the south-south cooperation agreement between the two countries.

<P>
Within the frame work of the south-south cooperation between 
Nigeria and that of China under the National Special Program for 
Food Security (NSPFS), he said, "there are 393 Chinese experts and
technicians in agriculture and related disciplines working 
directly with farmers in farming communities in 109 NSPFS sites 
Nationwide."

<P>
According to Ingawa, the seminar tagged "Poverty Alleviation 
Through Bamboo-based Development in Agriculture: China Experience"
is necessitated by the need to borrow a leaf from China which 
earned as mush as 3.5 billion US dollars in foreign exchange from 
the bamboo-based sector in 2003.

<P>
Early this year, he said, Michael Idowu, an agro-forestry 
national facilitator, represented Nigeria to participate in an 
international workshop on poverty alleviation through bamboo-based
development in China.
</P>
<P>
He added that the volume of experience gathered through Nigeria
's participation has helped to stimulate the determination to 
explore Nigeria's vast bamboo reserve found mostly in the wild of 
southern and middle belt states of the country.
</P>
<P>
The NSPFS national project coordinator noted that Nigeria must 
reinvent its once enviable agricultural sector in a time when it 
is desirous of a viable alternative to oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigeria is to set up a bamboo national 
database in order to effectively explore abundant bamboo resource 
which can boast of turning out about 300 byproducts.

<HEADLINE>
Geared Toward the Environmentally Conscious

Catalog and online retailer Viva Terra debuted last October, and
although its products for home, garden and pantry are geared toward
the environmentally conscious, there's nothing aesthetically
compromised about them: chairs and bowls fashioned from recycled wine
barrels, organic bedding and bathrobes, and bamboo-extract towels made
at a windmill-powered factory on an island off the coast of Japan.

Think Marin County day spa -- not Berkeley commune -- and you'll get
a good idea of how this Northern California-based outfit has married
sophisticated design with the Earth Day ethos. www.vivaterra.com.

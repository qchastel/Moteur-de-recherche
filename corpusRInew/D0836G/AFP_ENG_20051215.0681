A state in northeast India plans 
to set up a pioneering environmentally-friendly power stations that 
run on bamboo to help meet the region's energy needs, officials 
said.
</P>
<P>
Assam state will be the first in India to use the "green" power 
and one of the first places in the world to tap the energy potential 
of the fast-growing grass.
</P>
<P>
The state plans to set up two one-megawatt capacity power plants 
that run on bamboo by February.
</P>
<P>
"This would be the first of its kind where we are using bamboo 
and bamboo wastes to generate electricity," Vinay S. Oberoi, 
director of the National Mission on Bamboo Applications, told AFP 
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This would not only be cost effective, but also highly 
eco-friendly."
</P>
<P>
The government organization, which has centers in five 
northeastern states, funds research into commercial, industrial and 
other uses for bamboo, which grows widely in the area.
</P>
<P>
India, the world's largest producer of bamboo after China, grows 
about 80 million tons of the grass each year, more than half of it 
in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
The two power projects will cost an estimated total of 100 
million rupees (2.2 million dollars), and were designed and 
developed by scientists at the Indian Institute of Science in the 
southern city of Bangalore, which has been working on turning bamboo 
into gas, and then electricity.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident the commercial success of gasification of 
bamboo for generation of electricity would help us to solve the 
energy crisis facing India and allow our experts to pursue such 
ventures on a bigger scale," Oberoi said.
</P>
<P>
The electricity produced by the bamboo-based power plants, about 
2,000,000 watts a year, will be used by local paper mills 
initially.
</P>
<P>
"Power from the two plants would be now used by two paper mills 
although such bamboo-fuelled energy could be suitably used in 
off-grid and remote locations, and to meet captive industry and 
utility needs," Oberoi said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Bangalore-based scientific institute are 
working with the bamboo organization to develop a similar 
medium-sized power plant for the Indian army in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
Oberoi said bamboo was also being used for pre-fabricated 
quake-shelters in Indian Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
A 7.6-magnitude earthquake in October killed more than 73,000 
people in Pakistan and 1,300 in India, and left more than 3.5 
million people homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave the idea to the Jammu and Kashmir government and now 
they are placing orders to at least four manufacturers of bamboo 
shelters," Oberoi said.

BAMBOO BRANCHES OUT IN KITCHEN AND BEYOND

Tell someone you're planning to decorate with bamboo and they may
wonder if you are taking your design cues from Ricardo
Montalban and "Fantasy Island," with its Tiki bars and oversized
chairs.
</P>
<P>
That image is so old that even bamboo's newer image as
a sturdy alternative for hardwood flooring is showing some age,
too. Flooring is still the most likely use for bamboo
in the home, but designers today are using this strong,
versatile grass all over the house, for everything from kitchen
cabinets to countertops, cutting boards to serving bowls, shower curtains
to dining room chairs.
</P>
<P>
The appeal of bamboo is often its clean, airy look and
perhaps its association with warmer climes, but there's more to
it than that. It has greater tensile strength than steel;
it's a sustainable, environmentally friendly material (it grows fast enough
to be harvested within three to five years without depleting
natural resources, and it regenerates quickly); and it can cost
less and last longer than red oak, the wood most
commonly used for flooring.

<P>
What's not to like?

One company bringing fresh interpretations to bamboo is called, suitably enough,
bambu. The two-year-old New York firm makes bamboo bowls, cutleryand
flatware, and biodegradable plates. Fortune magazine named bambu's Veneerware plates
among the 25 best products of 2004. This year the
company is introducing several new products, including a new cutting
board called "the plank," a super-sized stirring spoon called "the
big stir," and appetizer pieces called sporks.

Founder and designer Rachel Speth and partner Jeff Delkin answered questions
about bambu via e-mail from Shanghai, where they live.
</P>
<P>
"When we created bambu, we set out to inform and excite
people about renewable materials. That was our goal. But we
also realized that to do that effectively, we had to
create products that offered good design and aesthetic appeal at
a good value," writes Speth. "Customers have to like what
it looks like, enjoy what it feels like. Then, when
they learn of all the wonderful environmental benefits of bamboo,
it enhances the buying experience."

Bamboo kitchenware has come a long way from chopsticks and steamers.
Totally Bamboo, a North Hollywood company owned by Tom Sullivan
and Joanne Chen, makes a wide range of laminated bamboo
cutting boards, serving bowls, and utensils. Sullivan says he's also
done prototypes for bamboo dashboards and gearshift knobs in cars
as well as shower curtains. Recently, he made a bamboo
guitar for a client. Later this year the company intends
to launch a line of bamboo countertops and is looking
into making bamboo building materials.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to break new ground with everything we do," Sullivan
says.
</P>
<P>
Bamboo furniture designers are also breaking new ground with sleek and
modern pieces that are a far cry from the kitschy
look of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Minakawa is the founder of Ukao, which means "way of
life" in Swahili. The line includes tables, seating, and custom-designed
pieces that are available at RISD Works in Providence. Minakawa,
a Rhode Island School of Design alumnus, spoke by phone
from Bolivia, where he was working with Andean textile weavers
and helping a nongovernmental organization devoted to bamboo products get
on its feet.

<P>
"In 2000, I visited my sister in Japan for three weeks,
and discovered how people could live with bamboo. I realize
now how
</P>
<P>
"Important this is, because rather than simply being a chic or
trendy object, it has been a cultural icon in Japan
since time immemorial," Minakawa says. "After thousands of years, [the
Japanese] and other cultures continue to technologically refine and offer
exciting artistic interpretations to the material."

Despite the increasingly wide range of uses for bamboo, flooring remains
one of the most popular.
</P>
<P>
Trevor Gilmore, a partner in Bamboo Mountain, based in Novato, Calif.,
says his company uses formaldehyde-free glue and Moso bamboo from
China that's harvested every five to six years and can
grow as tall as 100 feet. Bamboo Mountain produces flooring
in a light-colored natural shade and a darker brown carbonized
variety, both of which can be stained and finished.
</P>
<P>
The one caution Gilmore offers consumers is to do some homework
to be sure you're getting a quality product with a
long-term warranty.
</P>
<P>
"We suggest everyone get one sample and take a look at
the side view. There shouldn't be any gaps," he says.
"If there are, that means the manufacturing and the glue
are not up to par and there could be problems
down the road with warping and buckling."
</P>
<P>
While several companies have taken a recent interest in bamboo, San
Francisco's Smith and Fong has been selling bamboo home products
for almost 20 years. Like Bamboo Mountain, Smith and Fong's
East Coast clientele is steadily growing, especially among those drawn
to bamboo's environmental benefits, says company cofounder Daniel Smith.
</P>
<P>
"I went searching specifically for formaldehyde-free materials," says Howard Goldkrand, a
Smith and Fong customer and multimedia artist who divides his
time between New York and Boston. "The flooring has been
in place less than two months. It's great looking, it
does all the things they say it does. But more
important, I'm happy with the environmental choices I'm making."
</P>
<P>
Smith started out selling bamboo tea boxes from the back of
his 1972 orange Volkswagen. Today, Smith and Fong makes bamboo
flooring as well as cabinets and paneling. The flooring is
made out of laminated bamboo that the company calls Plyboo.
It's created by boiling bamboo strips in a solution of
lime and boric acid, drying them in a kiln, and
sanding the strips before laminating them into multi-ply panels. The
flooring comes in two colors, natural (or untreated) bamboo and
amber, which is steamed to a light-brown shade. Its wall
paneling also comes in green and black tambour, made of
naturally black bamboo.
</P>
<P>
"I think bamboo probably appeals to a whole variety of people,"
says Smith. "People just looking for something new and different,
people looking for something green and alternative who want to
think they're contributing to a better world, people who relate
to Asian design."

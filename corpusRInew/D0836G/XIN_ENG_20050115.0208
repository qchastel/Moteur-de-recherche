The number of giant pandas has 
increased to 102 in the Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve in 
the northwestern province of Gansu, according to the latest survey
conducted by the reserve authority.

a result of improved environment, a source with the nature reserve

of the giant pandas in Gansu and 6.4 percent of the national 
figure.

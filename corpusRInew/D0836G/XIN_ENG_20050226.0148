Trade and Industry Tadesse Haile said Saturday his country has the
desire to share China's experiences in bamboo-processing.

due to the lack of due attention to the proper utilization of 
bamboo.

Tadesse was speaking here at a workshop on ways of optimizing 
the utilization of bamboo in view of its importance in poverty 
reduction.

bamboo production in Ethiopia is estimated at one-fourth of that

According to the study, bamboo harvest in Ethiopia constitutes 
67 percent of the total production in Africa.

and the trainees of the workshop watched displays of various 
furniture made from bamboo.

<P>
At least one person was killed and seven injured when the trailer of a grain
truck fell on top of them during a food stampede in this hunger-ravaged southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened Friday at a government-run food depot in Bangwe, a crowded
township in the commercial capital, Blantyre, police spokesman Willy Mwaluka
said.
</P>
<P>
Hungry people had been waiting there for days to buy subsidized maize meal from
the Agriculture Development and Marketing Corp. When the truck arrived from
Mozambique, they rushed forward and were beaten back by guards wielding whips,
said Mary Mdoka, who was among the crowd.

<P>
"We were pushed hard and some of us fell down," she said. "It was sheer luck
that not more that 20 people were killed when the trailer descended on
us."
</P>
<P>
A guard said the depot's employees were trying to unhook the heavy trailer when
it slipped, and they lost control of it. He refused to be identified for fear of
retribution.
</P>
<P>
The incident comes two weeks after guards fired guns to break up another food
crush at a depot in the southern province of Nsanje, injuring two boys who
remain hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Up to 5 million people, almost half the population, are threatened with hunger
in Malawi, reeling from years of drought and an AIDS epidemic that is destroying
the agriculture work force.
</P>
<P>
Maize prices have skyrocketed, putting grain out of reach of many Malawians, 65
percent of whom survive on less than a dollar (euro) a day. Most depend on
subsidized grain, but the Agriculture Development and Marketing Corp. has also
suffered shortages.
</P>
<P>
In some of the worst-hit districts, people have resorted to eating water lily
bulbs, bamboo seeds and termites.

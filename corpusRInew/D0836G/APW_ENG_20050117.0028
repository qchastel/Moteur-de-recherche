KFC booming in China; sub the cole slaw with bamboo shoots

China's relentless appetite for the colonel's chicken has KFC on a building boom
in the world's most populous country, with 1,200 locations, soaring profits and
a menu that mixes in bamboo shoots and lotus roots.
</P>
<P>
At a time when its sales in the United States are struggling, KFC is dominating
even rival McDonald's in China and turning the goateed visage of Kentucky Fried
Chicken founder Colonel Harland Sanders into a ubiquitous symbol of
America.
</P>
<P>
"We are really positioned as a part of the fabric of life in China," said David
Novak, chairman and chief executive of Louisville-based Yum Brands Inc., parent
company of KFC.
</P>
<P>
In China, KFC customers can dig into buckets of original recipe chicken, but
some dishes are tailored for the Chinese palate.
</P>
<P>
There's a twister sandwich styled after the way Peking duck is served, but with
fried chicken inside along with cucumber shreds. Instead of cole slaw, which
never caught on in China, customers can order seasonal vegetables. In spring,
it's bamboo shoots; in summer, lotus roots are on the menu. And in colder
months, there's rice porridge and winter soup.
</P>
<P>
KFC also offers a breakfast menu in China, a concept that the company doesn't
envision introducing at its U.S. restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Yum's operating profits in China exceeded $200 million (euro153 million) in 2004
_ more than half the company's burgeoning international profits. And the pace of
275 locations opened in the country last year is expected to be matched in
2005.
</P>
<P>
Sam Su, president of Yum's China division, called China "the ultimate
marketplace." He predicted that as the Chinese economy grows, it will someday
surpass the number of KFC restaurants in the United States, where there are
5,453 stand-alone locations and 1,277 multibrand outlets featuring other Yum
brands.
</P>
<P>
"In many parts of China, the local municipal governments actually view the
arrival of a KFC as a sign of the city coming of age," Su said in a phone
interview from China.
</P>
<P>
A restaurant industry analyst said KFC's recipe for success in China includes a
solid business plan guided by a management team intact for years.
</P>
<P>
"For many companies, China is a hope and a dream _ maybe a very realistic hope
and a dream _ but for Yum it's reality today," said Joe Buckley with Bear
Stearns  Co. "It's an important piece of the company that still has plenty
of growth potential ahead of it."
</P>
<P>
Yum's China operations represented about 15 percent of the company's operating
profits in 2004, a figure expected to reach about 18 percent this year, Buckley
said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese fast-food consumers have shown a preference for chicken, giving KFC a
leg up. "It's an advantage to be the chicken brand, given that scenario,"
Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
Other Yum brands also are vying for Chinese customers.
</P>
<P>
Yum opened at least 39 Pizza Hut restaurants in China last year, for a total of
146 outlets, and Su predicts a bright future for the chain.
</P>
<P>
"With the rising income and economic growth, there's no reason to doubt that
Pizza Hut will be a huge brand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell is testing a casual dining format in China, and Yum is even dabbling
in Chinese fast-food with one test restaurant in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
But KFC is clearly at the forefront of Yum's expansion. More than 100 KFC
restaurants have sprung up in both Beijing and Shanghai. The chain has spread to
every Chinese province and region except Tibet. KFC restaurants have reached 280
Chinese cities, compared to just 20 cities in 2000. Yum's revenues in China
topped $1 billion last year, up from $261 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere around the globe, KFC opened about 50 new restaurants last year in the
United Kingdom, another high-growth market for Yum, raising its total chicken
outlets to 660.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, KFC has struggled in a crowded fast-food sector, including
burger chains that have added chicken to their menus.
</P>
<P>
In China, KFC has outpaced rival McDonald's, which has its own expansion
plans.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's has more than 600 restaurants in China and plans to open about 100
more this year, comparable to last year. Its long-range plans call for 1,000
restaurants in China by 2008.
</P>
<P>
"We're very bullish on China," said spokesman Walt Riker. "We're aggressively
expanding the business."
</P>
<P>
Novak said Yum has a big head start over its competitors in China and intends to
build on that advantage. "We are truly walking the talk in terms of taking this
market," he said.

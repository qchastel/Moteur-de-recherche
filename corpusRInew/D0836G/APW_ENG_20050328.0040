Bamboo die-off threatens wild pandas in western China

Giant pandas in western China could be at risk of starvation because the bamboo
plants that they eat are beginning to die off in a cycle that happens about
every 60 years, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Workers at the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve in the northwestern province
of Gansu plan to monitor the 102 pandas in the preserve for signs of hunger,
Xinhua said in a report late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Threatened pandas will be moved to areas that still have bamboo, with special
attention given to older, feeble animals, it said, citing Zhang Kerong, the
preserve's director.
</P>
<P>
Pandas derive most of their nutrition from arrow bamboo and can starve once the
plant enters its dying-off stage. The stage begins when the bamboo forms
flowers, after which the pandas refuse to eat it. The bamboo then starts to
produce seeds before dying.
</P>
<P>
Blooming happens about once every 60 years, with a new crop taking 10 years to
mature. However, the cycle seems to run along different schedules in different
places and an earlier mass die-off of bamboo in the 1980s caused the deaths of
about 250 pandas, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua said some bamboo has also started blooming in Sichuan and Shaanxi
provinces, home to the rest of China's estimated 1,590 wild pandas.
</P>
<P>
Flowering bamboo now covers more than 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of the
220,000-hectare (544,000-acre) preserve, Xinhua said. It said 22 pandas living
in the preserve's Bikou and Rangshuihe areas were directly threatened with
starvation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said rangers would patrol for ailing animals and rescue those in need.
Local villagers have also been told not to drive away or harm pandas if they
enter inhabited areas looking for food.
</P>
<P>
China regards the panda as an unofficial national mascot, but the animal's
limited diet is just one factor threatening its survival. Panda numbers have
declined as its habitat has fallen to farming and development, and the animal's
low fertility rate causes it to reproduce at an agonizingly slow
rate.
</P>
<P>
Chinese zoologists have improved the birth rate of giant pandas in captivity
through artificial insemination. The country has also launched a project to
clone the animal as a way of boosting its numbers.

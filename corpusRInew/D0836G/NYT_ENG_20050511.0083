BAMBOO-LIKE PLANT MAY BOOST ECONOMY, HARM ECOLOGY THE TUSCALOOSA (ALA.) NEWS

<P>
A proposed mill that could turn a bamboo-like
plant to pulp might be an economic boon for this
part of western Alabama, but it also could wreak ecological
havoc.
</P>
<P>
Global Cellulose Systems, a British company, wants to build a $530
million production facility in Linden's industrial park that could employ
as many as 500 workers.
</P>
<P>
The company also is seeking a commitment from area farmers to
grow the bamboo-like Arundo donax plant on as many as
30,000 acres. The crop could prove very profitable for producers,
but the plant has been identified as a scourge in
many areas.
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst invasive plant in much of the world," said
Jim Miller, a research ecologist for the USDA Forest Service
in Auburn. "That's like the idea of planting kudzu, isn't
it?"
</P>
<P>
John Woods, president of Athens, Tenn.-based West Wing Technologies Inc., said
the plant has been a problem in areas like Mexico
and California, where it commonly grows in the wild, but
not when grown in a controlled environment.
</P>
<P>
"It's never been a problem in plantations," he said, adding that
the plant hasn't been grown on large tracts in the
South before.
</P>
<P>
Woods' company specializes in growing and cloning bamboo and similar plants,
and would assist regional farmers who choose to grow the
crop. Representatives from West Wing Technologies and Global Cellulose Systems
plan to meet with area farmers this week to discuss
plans for the mill and the plant.
</P>
<P>
Woods said it would take two years for the first crop
to mature. But the reed could be harvested every six
months thereafter, with a likely production of 17 to 26
tons per acre. That could mean several hundred dollars per
acre for the farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Dixon, chairman of the Linden Area Industrial Development Board, said
he doesn't think getting a commitment from farmers will be
an issue.
</P>
<P>
"If you show them the money, I think they'll show you
the land," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dixon said the industrial board heard of the company's desire to
build a mill in the American South and contacted its
officials. The months-long conversation has Global Cellulose Systems ready to
come to Marengo County.
</P>
<P>
The pulp that would be manufactured from the crop is used
for a variety of products, from shirts to flooring, and
is sold mostly in Europe, Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
He said the location of the mill in Linden would have
a big impact on the area.
</P>
<P>
"If this happens, offering 300-500 jobs in Linden, Alabama, I think
it would change the economic outlook of the town forever,"
he said. "It's going to help our whole county."
</P>
<P>
But what would it do to the environment?
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Nature Conservancy say that Arundo donax can rapidly
invade stream banks and roadside habitats. After it's established, the
plant tends to suppress native vegetation and has invaded irrigation
ditches, reducing their capacity.
</P>
<P>
Miller said it would be nearly impossible to keep the plants
from getting into drainage systems and spreading to surrounding areas,
despite what Woods said.
</P>
<P>
"If it's released in the landscape it will get in our
streams," Miller said. "It will grow along them and change
our habitat."
</P>
<P>
The plant already exists in Alabama, but only in limited quantities.
It is native to the Mediterranean region, where it has
been widely planted in Italy and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Like kudzu, Arundo donax was imported into the United States, originally
for aesthetic reasons or for windbreaks on California ranches.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who recently led a conference on invasive plants including Arundo
donax, said bringing it in large quantities to Alabama could
be like the second coming of kudzu. Warning that it
would dry up streams and destroy wildlife habitat, he said
policies are needed to prevent importing such invasive plants.
</P>
<P>
"The way is to develop industry and bar everything else," he
said. "That's the way of capitalism."
</P>
<P>
The region needs to do something, he said, "but it doesn't
need this."

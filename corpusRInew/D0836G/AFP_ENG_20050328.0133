<P>
Flowering arrow bamboo is threatening 
a colony of endangered giant pandas in China but experts have come 
up with a plan to save them, state media said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two giant pandas living in parts of Baishuijiang State 
Nature Reserve in the northwestern province of Gansu will be moved 
to other locations with better food, the China Daily said, quoting 
Zhang Kerong, director of the reserve.
</P>
<P>
Arrow bamboo in two areas of the reserve which they inhabit is 
flowering, which means the plant will seed and die at the end of its 
life span.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it 
takes 10 years for a new supply to grow. Bamboo blooming in the 
early 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 giant pandas, the report 
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the reserve will send frequent patrols and rescue 
giant pandas in danger of starvation, but did not say where they 
would go or how they would be moved.
</P>
<P>
Locals, meanwhile, have been told not to harm the animals if 
they enter villages looking for food.
</P>
<P>
As of late last year, the flowering bamboo covered more than 
7,000 hectares (17,290 acres) of the 220,000-hectare nature reserve 
and the blooming area has continued to expand.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 giant pandas live there.
</P>
<P>
To help them survive, the Baishuijiang reserve is planting more 
bamboo in hopes of helping the animals to increase their 
population.
</P>
<P>
However, a survey found that 12 percent of planted bamboo showed 
signs of blooming, rendering it inedible, China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
If the situation worsens all the pandas in the reserve will have 
to be transferred elsewhere. Since the 1970s, many pandas in the 
reserve have died because of food shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Currently more than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, 
according to a survey by the State Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up more than 50 reserves, most in the 
southwest province of Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
But in Sichuan and in Shaanxi province, which also has panda 
reserves, arrow bamboo has also been found blooming.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas also continue to face threats from humans such as 
poaching, mining and logging, the report said.

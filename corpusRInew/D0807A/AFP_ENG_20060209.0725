<P>
Indicted former top White House 
aide I. Lewis 'Scooter' Libby will argue that Vice President Dick 
Cheney authorized him to leak classified information in 2003 to 
bolster the case for the US-led war against Iraq, US news media 
reported late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Libby, who has been charged in a federal investigation into the 
outing of a CIA agent, will in part base his defense on the claim 
that Cheney had encouraged him to share classified information with 
reporters, NBC television news said, citing sources familiar with 
the case.
</P>
<P>
Libby's attorneys discussed Cheney's authorization with federal 
prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald and the judge handling the case in a 
recent teleconference call, NBC News reported,
</P>
<P>
The online edition of the magazine National Journal reported 
that Libby had testified to a federal grand jury that Cheney and 
other White House "superiors" had "authorized" him in mid-2003 to 
leak classified information to defend the administration's prewar 
intelligence assertions in making the case to go to war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The magazine quoted attorneys familiar with the matter and court 
records as sources.
</P>
<P>
Libby also argued that Cheney authorized him to release details 
of the classified National Intelligence Estimate, the magazine 
reported, citing sources with firsthand knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Libby, Cheney's former chief of staff, denies charges of 
obstruction of justice, perjury and making false statements in an 
intrigue bound up in the US drive to war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
His trial will be held in January 2007, after November's crucial 
mid-term US elections.
</P>
<P>
The case arose from a federal probe into the outing of Central 
Intelligence Agency spy Valerie Plame, during the run-up to the Iraq 
war in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Critics charge that senior US officials deliberately blew 
Plame's cover to punish her husband, ex-diplomat Joseph Wilson, for 
criticising the White House's rationale for war.
</P>
<P>
Both NBC and the National Journal say that much of Libby's 
defense will be based on Cheney's alleged authorization to discuss 
the documents.
</P>
<P>
The president's top political guru, Karl Rove, is still under 
investigation over the leaking of Plame's name.

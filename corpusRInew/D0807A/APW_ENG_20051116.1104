Libby returns to courthouse; Post reporter Bob Woodward testifies in CIA leak investigation

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Dick Cheney's former top aide, indicted last month on perjury and
obstruction charges, reviewed documents Wednesday at a federal
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his legal team, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby walked into the
courthouse without the crutches that he'd been using during a court appearance
two weeks ago when he pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from the CIA leak
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Libby's visit to the courthouse came hours The Washington Post reported that at
least one senior Bush administration official _ who was not identified _ told
editor Bob Woodward about CIA operative Valerie Plame about a month before her
identity was publicly exposed.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that Woodward told prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, who is
investigating the leak of Plame's identity, that the official talked to him
about Plame in mid-June 2003. Woodward and editors at the Post refused to
identify the official to reporters other than to say it was not
Libby.
</P>
<P>
Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Karl Rove's legal team, said Rove was not the
official who talked to Woodward. Rove is a top deputy to President George W.
Bush and was referred to, but not by name, in Libby's indictment, as having
discussed Plame's identity with reporters.
</P>
<P>
Libby was indicted last month on one charge of obstruction of justice and two
counts each of false statement and perjury in connection with Fitzgerald's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Plame's husband, former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson, had criticized U.S.
intelligence efforts before the Iraq war. On June 23, Libby told New York Times
reporter Judith Miller that Wilson's wife might work at the Central Intelligence
Agency. Robert Novak, in a column published July 14, identified Plame, as a CIA
operative.
</P>
<P>
Woodward's testimony in a two-hour deposition Monday would mean that another
White House official told a reporter about Plame before Libby revealed her
identity to Miller.
</P>
<P>
William Jeffress Jr., one of Libby's lawyers, told the Post that Woodward's
testimony raises questions about his client's indictment. "Will Mr. Fitzgerald
now say he was wrong to say on TV that Scooter Libby was the first official to
give this information to a reporter?" Jeffress said.
</P>
<P>
Woodward, famous for his investigation with Carl Bernstein of the Watergate
scandal during the Nixon administration, is now assistant managing editor of the
Post. In October, he was dismissive of the outing of Plame, telling CNN
television's Larry King that the damage from her exposure was "quite
minimal."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Woodward apologized for not telling his boss, Washington Post's
executive editor Leonard Downie Jr., about his being among the journalists who
were told about Plame's identity, even as the investigation morphed into a
national scandal.
</P>
<P>
Woodward held back the information because he wanted to protect his sources and
because was worried about being subpoenaed in the inquiry, according to the
newspaper's Web site.
</P>
<P>
"I hunkered down. I'm in the habit of keeping secrets," Woodward said. "I didn't
want anything out there that was going to get me subpoenaed."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Associated Press on Wednesday joined other news organizations in
asking U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton to deny a court motion by Fitzgerald
for a blanket protective order keeping all pretrial evidence in Libby's case out
of public view.
</P>
<P>
The special prosecutor is seeking a court order that would prohibit Libby and
his legal team from publicly disclosing "all materials produced by the
government."

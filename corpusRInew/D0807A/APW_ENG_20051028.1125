At least seven administration officials knew of Plame's identity before public disclosure

<P>
At least seven Bush administration officials outside the CIA knew Valerie Plame
was a CIA employee before the disclosure of her name in a newspaper column in
July 2003, according to Friday's indictment of I. Lewis "Scooter"
Libby.
</P>
<P>
In no case other than Libby's does the indictment contend that one of the
government employees provided the name to reporters. The indictment does not
identify anyone other than Libby.
</P>
<P>
But some are easy to determine. Of course, the "vice president of the United
States" is Dick Cheney, for whom Libby worked as chief of staff. Cheney told
Libby that Plame worked at the CIA, information that Libby understood came from
the agency, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
The person referred to as "then White House press secretary" is Ari Fleischer.
Libby discussed Plame's employment at the CIA with Fleischer, noting "that such
information was not widely known," the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
Names of two of the others were disclosed by a Justice Department official who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the identities have not been publicly
released.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman also told Libby that Plame worked at the
CIA, apparently in response to a request from Libby for details about a former
ambassador's trip to Niger to investigate claims that Iraq tried to buy uranium
yellowcake in that African nation. The ex-diplomat was Joseph Wilson, Plame's
husband.
</P>
<P>
The "assistant to the vice president for public affairs" is Catherine Martin.
She learned that Plame was a CIA employee from yet another government official
and advised Libby. The identity of the other government official remains a
secret.
</P>
<P>
Another mystery is the person described in the indictment as "a senior official
in the White House." This person, identified as "Official A," also spoke about
Plame's job and identity with columnist Robert Novak a few days before Novak's
column appeared.
</P>
<P>
It's possible this person is White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove, who
has acknowledged talking to reporters about Plame. Rove was not indicted but
remains under investigation.

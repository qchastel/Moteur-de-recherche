<P>
US Vice President Dick Cheney was 
linked to a case involving a leak to journalists of an undercover 
CIA agent's identity, according to a report Monday in the New York 
Times.
</P>
<P>
The report on the newspaper's website, citing lawyers involved 
in the case, said that notes taken by I. Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief 
of staff who has been questioned in the investigation of the leak, 
show that Libby learned of the identity of the agent from the vice 
president.
</P>
<P>
The notes appear to contradict Libby's testimony to a federal 
grand jury that he initially learned about Valerie Wilson, also 
known by her maiden name as Valerie Plame, from journalists, the 
Times said.
</P>
<P>
A special prosecutor and a grand jury are investigating the 
disclosure of her identity, allegedly in retaliation for critical 
comments made to the media by her husband, former ambassador Joseph 
Wilson, which contradicted one of US President George W. Bush's 
justifications for waging war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In some cases revealing the name of a covert CIA agent can be a 
federal crime.
</P>
<P>
The Times reported lawyers as saying that Libby's notes show 
that Cheney mentioned Plame's identity to Libby on June 12, 2003, 
about one month before her identity was revealed by a newspaper 
columnist, Robert Novak, citing senior administration sources.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Libby's notes indicate that Mr. Cheney had gotten his 
information about Ms. Wilson from George J. Tenet, the director of 
central intelligence, in response to questions from the vice 
president about Mr. Wilson," the Times said.
</P>
<P>
"But they contain no suggestion that either Mr. Cheney or Mr. 
Libby knew at the time of Ms. Wilson's undercover status or that her 
identity was classified," it said.

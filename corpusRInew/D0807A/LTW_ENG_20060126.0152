Reporters' Information Sought in Plame Leak Case
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for Vice President Dick Cheney's former top
aide urged a court Thursday to force prosecutors to turn over all the
information they obtained from reporters about their confidential
conversations with Bush administration sources in the course of a
two-year CIA leak investigation.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for I. Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby said they must cast a wide
net to learn about any conversations regarding CIA operative Valerie
Plame, and that the information could be crucial to Libby's defense
against perjury and obstruction charges. In court papers, the lawyers
said they will probably subpoena reporters and officials later to
thoroughly investigate how widely Plame's identity was known before
her name appeared in the news media in July 2003.
</P>
<P>
Libby was indicted by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald on five
felony counts of lying to the FBI and a grand jury. The indictment
asserted that Libby leaked information about Plame's CIA role to two
reporters but pretended he had learned the information from Tim
Russert, the Washington bureau chief of NBC News, and that he passed
it along as unverified reporter chatter.
</P>
<P>
The defense's goal is to show that Libby was not intentionally
lying when he testified that many journalists had known about Plame
during the spring and summer of 2003, and that he believed he had
learned about her from Russert. ``There can be no information more
material to the defense of a perjury case than information tending to
show that the alleged false statements are, in fact, true or that they
could be the result of mistake or confusion,'' the lawyers argued in
their filing. ``Libby is entitled to know what the government knows.''
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald began investigating in early 2004 whether administration
officials broke the law and leaked information about Plame as
retaliation. Her name and CIA role appeared in a July 2003 syndicated
column by Robert Novak -- eight days after Plame's husband, former
ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, publicly criticized the Bush
administration's justification for waging war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The defense effort to delve deeper into Fitzgerald's investigation,
if successful, could divulge the identities of some anonymous,
high-level government sources whom reporters and news organizations
have spent years and millions of dollars in legal fees protecting from
public view. The defense strategy is expected to pull several
high-profile Washington journalists into a legal battle over the First
Amendment, many of them for a second time.
</P>
<P>
The court papers specifically asked U.S. District Judge Reggie
Walton to have Fitzgerald turn over all documents showing knowledge by
other reporters of Plame's CIA role or her husband's mission to
investigate claims that Iraq was trying to obtain from Niger materials
for a nuclear program, and any subpoenas or agreements with other
reporters who provided information to the investigation. Fitzgerald
has asserted that Libby is not entitled to information about all the
reporters questioned in the investigation if the government does not
expect to use their information or call them as witnesses in Libby's
trial, the filings said.
</P>
<P>
But the court papers filed by Libby's team highlighted Bob
Woodward, a Washington Post reporter and assistant managing editor, as
a crucial witness who could provide exculpatory information that might
help Libby avoid a conviction. Woodward revealed in November, a few
weeks after Libby was indicted, that another administration source --
not Libby -- had told him in a ``casual'' and ``offhand'' way about
Plame's CIA role. Woodward testified that this conversation took place
before Libby is believed to have first provided information about
Plame to Judith Miller, then a New York Times reporter.
</P>
<P>
Woodward, who has repeatedly said he has not been released to
identify his source, declined to comment Thursday. Washington Post
attorney Mary Ann Werner said the newspaper continues to consider its
promises of anonymity to sources sacred -- and vital to some kinds of
newsgathering.
</P>
<P>
``Protecting our confidential sources has been our highest priority
throughout this investigation, and it remains our highest priority
today,'' Werner said.
</P>
<P>
The court papers also mentioned an interest in questioning NBC News
reporter Andrea Mitchell, who suggested in an October 2003 news
program that it was ``common knowledge'' among some intelligence
reporters that Plame worked at the CIA, and Washington Post reporter
Walter Pincus, who allegedly learned about Plame from another
unidentified source in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Charles Tobin, a media lawyer in Washington, said the move by
Libby's defense was expected and is the result of Fitzgerald's
aggressive insistence on deposing journalists and forcing them under
threat of jail to reveal confidential sources.
</P>
<P>
``I think we could have expected that, when the prosecutor went on
a fishing expedition, that the fish he caught would want to look back
in the pail,'' Tobin said. ``The more this case develops, the further
we seem to be getting from the core issues of the indictment -- and
more into the business of journalism and how news gets put out in this
town.''

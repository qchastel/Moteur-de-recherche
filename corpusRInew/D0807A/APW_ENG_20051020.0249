</DATELINE>

<P>
Top White House aides Karl Rove and I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby exchanged
information about their contacts with reporters regarding Valerie Plame in the
days just before the CIA officer's cover was blown.
</P>
<P>
Rove told grand jurors it was even possible he first learned inside the White
House from Libby that Bush administration critic Joe Wilson's wife worked for
the CIA, according to people directly familiar with the testimony of President
George W. Bush's closest political adviser.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure is the first known intersection between two central figures in
the criminal investigation into the leak of Plame's identity.
</P>
<P>
Rove testified that his discussions with Libby before Plame's identity was made
public were limited to information reporters had passed them, the people said.
Some evidence prosecutors have gathered conflicts with Libby's account of
dealings with reporters.
</P>
<P>
Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald must determine whether the contacts were
part of a concerted effort to illegally divulge Plame's CIA identity and
undercut her husband's public criticism of the Iraq war or simply the trading of
news and rumors that typically occurs inside the White House.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor also is examining whether any witnesses gave false testimony or
withheld information from the investigation. His spokesman, Randall Samborn,
declined comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Rove-Libby contacts were confirmed to The Associated Press by people
directly familiar with testimony the two witnesses gave or were shown before the
grand jury. All spoke solely on condition of anonymity because of the secrecy of
the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Libby's lawyer, Joseph Tate, did not return repeated phone calls this week
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
Rove and Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, have emerged as
central figures in Fitzgerald's investigation because both had contacts with
reporters who ultimately disclosed Plame's work for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
Federal law prohibits government officials from knowingly disclosing the
identity of intelligence operatives.
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with the testimony and evidence said that during one of his grand
jury appearances, Rove was shown testimony from Libby suggesting the two had
discussed with each other information they had gotten about Wilson's wife from
reporters in early July 2003.
</P>
<P>
Rove responded that Libby's testimony was consistent with his general
recollection that he first had learned that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA
from reporters or government officials who had talked with reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rove testified that he never intended any of his comments to reporters about
Wilson's wife to serve as confirmation of Plame's identity.
</P>
<P>
On July 9, 2003, columnist Robert Novak told Rove he was writing a column that
would report that Plame worked for the CIA, and Rove told the columnist he had
heard similar information, according to his testimony.
</P>
<P>
Novak published a column the next week that said Plame worked for the CIA and
had suggested that her agency send Wilson, a former ambassador, on a mission
that raised questions about prewar intelligence the Bush administration used to
justify invading Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Rove testified he told Libby about his contact with Novak about two days after
it occurred.
</P>
<P>
In testimony shown to Rove, Libby stated Rove had told him about his contact
with Novak and said he had told Rove about information he had gotten about
Wilson's wife from NBC television journalist Tim Russert, according to a person
directly familiar with the information shown to Rove.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, have a different account from Russert. The network has
said Russert told authorities he did not know about Wilson's wife's identity
until it was published and therefore could not have told Libby about
it.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also have evidence that Libby initiated the call with Russert and
had initiated similar contact with another reporter, Judith Miller of The New
York Times, several weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
Rove was pressed by prosecutors on several matters, including why he failed to
mention during the first of his four grand jury appearances that he also has
discussed the Plame matter with a second reporter, Matt Cooper of Time
magazine.
</P>
<P>
Rove testified during the first appearance about his contacts with Novak in the
days before the columnist wrote about Plame. When asked generally if he had
conversations with other reporters in that session, he answered
no.
</P>
<P>
Rove and his lawyer subsequently discovered an e-mail Rove had sent top national
security aide Stephen Hadley referencing a brief phone interview he had with
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
The e-mail jogged Rove's memory and during a subsequent grand jury appearance,
he volunteered his recollections about his conversation with Cooper, and his
lawyer provided the e-mail to prosecutors. Cooper also wrote a story about
Plame.

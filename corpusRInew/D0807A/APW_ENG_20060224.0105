Ex-White House aide Libby seeks dismissal of charges in CIA agent case

<P>
Lawyers for Vice President Dick Cheney's former top aide want a federal judge to
dismiss I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby's indictment on grounds the special prosecutor
in the CIA leak case lacked authority.
</P>
<P>
In a court filing, Libby's lawyers said his indictment violated the Constitution
because Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald was not appointed by the president
with the consent of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The defense attorneys also said Fitzgerald's appointment violated federal law
because his investigation was not supervised by the attorney general. They said
only Congress can approve such an arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said illegal assignment of "unsupervised and undirected power" to
Fitzgerald requires that he be relieved of his duties in the investigation and
that all actions he has taken be voided.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald was appointed in December 2003 after former Attorney General John
Ashcroft removed himself from the investigation because of his close
relationships with White House officials. Then-Deputy Attorney General James
Comey, acting in Ashcroft's place in the matter, selected Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
Comey gave Fitzgerald sweeping power to conduct the investigation into the leak
of CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity, exempting the special counsel from
following rules that apply to all U.S. attorneys throughout the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Unlike every other federal prosecutor, Fitzgerald did not have to seek approval
from senior Justice Department officials to grant immunity or subpoena reporters
and news organizations. Nor did he have to advise senior Justice officials
before he sought Libby's indictment.
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general may delegate powers but he may not abdicate
responsibility," Libby's lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
Libby, 55, who resigned as Cheney's chief of staff after he was indicted, is
charged with lying about how he learned Plame's identity and when he
subsequently told reporters. He faces five counts of perjury, false statements
and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Plame's identity as a CIA operative was published by columnist Robert Novak in
July 2003 after her husband, former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson, accused the
administration of twisting intelligence about Iraq's efforts to buy uranium
"yellowcake" in Niger. The year before, the CIA had sent Wilson to Niger to
determine the accuracy of the uranium reports.
</P>
<P>
Libby's lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton to conduct a hearing
and told him he may need to require the Justice Department to turn over records
_ including secret letters between Comey and Fitzgerald _ to determine whether
the special counsel's appointment is legal.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys and Fitzgerald will appear in U.S. District Court Friday to
argue over defense requests for classified records and evidence gathered by the
prosecution about reporters who learned about Plame from government officials
other than Libby.
</P>
<P>
Libby's trial is set for January 2007.
</P>
<P>
If the case goes to trial, defense attorneys have signaled that Libby probably
will testify that he was so busy with national security issues that he forgot or
incorrectly recalled conversations he had with reporters about "less important
topics," such as Plame.

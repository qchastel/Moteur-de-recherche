Government Ordered to Provide Some Documents to Libby

<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
A federal judge on Friday ordered the government to
provide I. Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby redacted versions of documents he
reviewed or information he requested during highly classified morning
intelligence briefings while he was chief of staff to Vice President
Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
Libby, who has been indicted on charges of perjury, making false
statements and obstructing justice in the CIA leak case, originally
sought a wide range of the CIA's most sensitive intelligence reports
to bolster his defense. Libby's lawyers have said they plan to argue
that Libby was so preoccupied with other pressing issues -- such as
those discussed at the top-secret morning briefings -- that he simply
forgot conversations he had with reporters and government officials
about CIA officer Valerie Plame.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said in Friday's decision that
the government must provide edited versions of intelligence material
also viewed by Cheney in morning briefings and a list, by topic only,
of information requests Libby made during those top-secret meetings.
Walton said that if the government cannot produce redacted copies of
the documents in question that a list of general topic areas discussed
each day would suffice. He said the material is relevant to Libby's
``preoccupation defense.''
</P>
<P>
``The Court has painstakingly endeavored to ensure that the
defendant is provided with the information he truly needs to prepare
his defense based upon what he represented through counsel will be his
theory of why he should not be held culpable for the offenses charged
in the indictment,'' Walton wrote.
</P>
<P>
The charges against Libby grew out of the investigation by special
prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald into whether any top administration
officials knowingly disclosed Plame's identity to discredit
allegations made by her husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson.
</P>
<P>
Libby originally asked for nearly a year's worth of the documents,
including the President's Daily Brief, the CIA's most sensitive
intelligence report, to establish that he was dealing with
life-and-death issues that dwarfed Plame in importance. As the vice
president's top aide, Libby sat in on the morning meetings that
covered the latest intelligence reports on Iraq, North Korea,
terrorist activity and other pressing national security matters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the CIA objected to providing copies of so much
material, saying it would divert too much time and attention away from
analysts working on other intelligence matters. The same day, Libby
scaled back his request in an effort to persaude Walton to order the
agency to turn over some of the material.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Libby defense team will be able to provide a broad
overview of the former Cheney aide's hectic schedule and stressful
responsibilities but not in the detail it originally sought.
</P>
<P>
In addition to limiting Libby's access to redacted copies or a list
of topics, Walton said the government must only turn over documents
covering a very specific set of dates. Libby originally sought
documents covering the period between May 2003 to March 2004.
</P>
<P>
Walton noted that most of what he ordered turned over to Libby will
not be seen by a jury. Classified evidence that Libby wants to use
first must be approved by the judge.
</P>
<P>
Walton said the White House and CIA have until March 24, 2006, to
make claims of executive privilege over the PDBs and related
documents. In the past, the White House has resisted efforts to turn
over documents about private communications, arguing that it would
discourage aides and advisers from providing candid advice in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The fight over the classified material has delayed the Libby
proceedings and prompted prosecutor Fitzgerald to charge that Libby's
defense team is requesting unobtainable legal documents in an effort
to derail the trial.

The Airbus A380 has passed its emergency evacuation test, the European aircraft
maker announced Wednesday, an important step toward the superjumbo's official
certification for commercial flights.
</P>
<P>
Both the European Aviation and Safety Agency and the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration approved the A380's performance in an emergency evacuation drill
conducted in a darkened aircraft hangar Sunday with 853 volunteers and 20
on-board staff.
</P>
<P>
One volunteer broke a leg and about 30 others sustained minor injuries during
the drill in Hamburg, Germany, when all 873 participants evacuated the plane in
under 80 seconds, using only eight of its 16 exits.
</P>
<P>
Airbus Chief Operating Officer Charles Champion said in a statement that the
A380 had "passed a major milestone on the road to certification."
</P>
<P>
Airbus aims to deliver the first two superjumbos to its launch customer
Singapore Airlines by the end of this year _ about six months behind the
original production schedule.

The Toulouse, France-based jetmaker is majority owned by European Aeronautic
Defence and Space Co.

   The A380, the new Airbus "superjumbo" 
which will be officially unveiled Tuesday, is the product of a 
decade of designing, drumming up of advance orders and dreams of 
knocking Boeing's 747 off its perch as the top bird in passenger 
transport.
   Here are some key dates in its development:
   
   Early 1990s: Airbus begins studying ideas for building an 
airliner capable of seating more than 500 passengers to compete 
against Boeing's 747, which started flying in 1970.
   
   June 1994: Airbus begins engineering development of the plane, 
then known as the A3XX.
   
   July 2000: Emirates Airlines becomes the first company to order 
the still under-wraps plane, saying it wants to buy seven.
   
   December 19, 2000: Airbus officially launches the plane, calling 
it the A380.

to handle assembly of the interior of A380 cabins. Assembly of the

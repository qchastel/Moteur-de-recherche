A380 'superjumbo' will be profitable from 2008: Airbus chief
</HEADLINE>

PARIS, Jan 16

<P>
The A380 'superjumbo', which will be 
presented to the world in a lavish ceremony in southern France on 
Tuesday, will be profitable from 2008, its maker Airbus told the 
French financial newspaper La Tribune.
</P>
<P>
"You need to count another three years," Airbus chief Noel 
Forgeard told Monday's edition of the newspaper when asked when the 
break-even point of the 10-billion-euro-plus 
(13-billion-dollar-plus) A380 programme would come.
</P>
<P>
So far, 13 airlines have placed firm orders for 139 of the new 
planes, which can seat between 555 and 840 passengers and which have 
a catalogue price of between 263 and 286 million dollars (200 and 
218 million euros).
</P>
<P>
The break-even point is calculated to arrive when the 250th A380 
is sold.
</P>
<P>
Airbus figures that, over the next two decades, more than 1,200 
aircraft of the size of the A380 will be required for point-to-point 
routes in the world.
</P>
<P>
Forgeard said "we are well above our market plan," and added 
that his aim was to bring in two new airlines as customers each 
year.
</P>
<P>
Asked about China adding its airlines' names to the order sheet, 
Forgeard said he predicted a firm order would be soon forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely confident that the A380 will be bought by a 
Chinese company in the first half of this year," he said, without 
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
In December, Forgeard hinted that an agreement in principle had 
been signed with a Chinese airline for five A380s, and Britain's 
Sunday Times newspaper cited industry sources who said that had been 
firmed up into actual orders with an option for another five, and 
that Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific was preparing a similar order.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus chief told La Tribune there would be Chinese 
representatives at Tuesday's unveiling ceremony in Toulouse, 
"notably from the China Southern airline."

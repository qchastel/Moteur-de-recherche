GIANT AIRBUS 380 MAKES MAIDEN FLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TOULOUSE, France
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a whisper more than a roar, the
largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380, took off
on its maiden flight Wednesday. The plane is Europe's newest
competitor in the battle with the Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
The airliner's four engines lifted the 421 metric-ton giant aloft at
about 10:29 a.m. as hundreds watched at the Blagnac airport
here. After nearly four hours, the Airbus landed at company
headquarters outside the city of Toulouse in southern France.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac immediately hailed the "total success of the
first test flight of the Airbus A380." In a statement
released by his office soon after the airliner landed, Chirac
said "a new page of aeronautical history has been written.It
is a magnificent result for European industrial cooperation and an
encouragement to pursue this path of building a Europe of
innovation and progress."
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the crowds cheered as the huge double-deck plane
rotated skyward at its takeoff speed of about 170 miles
per hour. The plane seemed almost to hover as it
lifted off and climbed. "The takeoff went perfectly," Alain Garcia,
an Airbus engineering executive, told the LCI television station in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
Its comparative lack of noise was the result of demands by
customers that Airbus make the plane even more quiet than
it
</P>
<P>
already was, a process that took six months.
</P>
<P>
The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers in three classes,
but it can be expanded to 800 seats.
</P>
<P>
The plane intended to stay within 100 miles of Toulouse, in
southwest France, and maintain relatively low altitudes. Takeoff weight was
421 metric tons, compared with the current maximum takeoff weight
of 560 tons.It landed at Blagnac after a flight lasting
nearly four hours.
</P>
<P>
The six-man test crew, dressed in orange jumpsuits, climbed into the
plane at 8:40 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The A380 is about one-third larger than its next-largest competitor, the
Boeing 747, which sold well for 35 years but is
now down to only a few sales a year.
</P>
<P>
So far, Airbus has 154 firm orders for the A380, 27
of them for the freighter version. The plane is scheduled
to enter service for Singapore Airlines in the second half
of 2006. By far the largest order is for 43
of the planes by Emirates airline, based in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
No American airlines have ordered any A380s, and none is expected
to do so any time soon.
</P>
<P>
This week, Air Canada said it had firm orders for 32
new Boeing jets, including 14 787s, with a list value
of about $6 billion, and Air India announced plans to
order 50 Boeing jets worth $6.8 billion. Air India wants
27 of the 787s, which will carry up to 257
passengers and have a list price of $120 million, bringing
total orders and commitments for the plane to 237. The
787, which was launched a year ago, is scheduled to
enter service in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Airbus says the A380 will produce half as much noise at
takeoff as the 747.
</P>
<P>
Airbus also stresses the plane's fuel efficiency, claiming that a customer
driving a compact car to the airport will burn more
fuel per mile than the A380 requires to move one
passenger 100 miles.A team of Airbus specialists has visited major
airports over the p ast few years to determine how
much work will be necessary to allow the A380 to
use runways and terminals. Airbus claims the cost will be
relatively small despite initial reports of huge costs. Most of
those costs would be necessary anyway as airports modernize, rather
than as a direct result of the A380, Airbus says.
</P>
<P>
Willie-Pierre Dupont, the Airbus director of infrastructure and environment, said he
and his team had visited the 60 airports worldwide where
the A380 might land, and have found that it will
be easier than most airports originally thought to accommodate the
A380.
</P>
<P>
Most A380 traffic will go into just 25 of those airports,
Dupont said. However, Airbus says that in the next 20
years the number of airports that could support A380 flights
will grow substantially.

While US government moans, airports ready for Airbus giant

<P>
US complaints about European 
government subsidies to Airbus Industrie have not stopped US 
airports preparing for the arrival of the giant A380 jet that is set 
to spark a new transatlantic trade dogfight.
</P>
<P>
A Monday deadline for an agreement is almost certain to pass 
without a result and the United States has said it will then take 
its complaint to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Airbus is hoping the 550-seat A380, the world's biggest jet, 
will revolutionize air travel.
</P>
<P>
And even though no US airline has ordered the European jet, 
aviation authorities are getting Los Angeles, New York's John F. 
Kennedy airport, San Francisco and Miami airports ready for the 
A-380 passenger flights in 2006, according to Dave Bennett of the 
Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Airport Safety and 
Standards.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see major safety or technical problems," said Bennett.
</P>
<P>
"We do expect the A380, soon after certificated to begin service 
at the US probably at 4 passengers airports initially and two more 
airports for freighters in 2008."
</P>
<P>
O'Hare airport in Chicago and Dulles in Washington will be ready 
later.
</P>
<P>
Memphis in Tennessee and Anchorage in Alaska should be ready for 
the cargo version of the A380 in 2008. Federal Express has ordered 
10 of the planes.
</P>
<P>
"The FAA has worked with each of these airports and the plans 
for operations of the A380 have been approved"
</P>
<P>
None of the airports is yet ready to handle the weight or width 
of the A380, according to Bennett. But he added that this should not 
be a major problem as the tonnage per wheel is no different from 
other aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The A380 will take over from the Boeing 747 as the biggest jet 
in the skies. Its 540 tonne weight is 30 percent more than the 747 
and its wingspan of 78 metres (257 feet) is 15 metres (50 feet) 
wider than Boeing's Jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
But access routes from terminals to runways will have to be 
widened and bridges underneath runways will have to be 
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The cost will be relatively modest, according to Dick Marchi, an 
expert on infrastructure for the Airport Council International North 
America.
</P>
<P>
He said a study was carried out which indicated each airport 
would have to spend about 80 million dollars to rebuild or widen 
taxiways and runway bridges for the A380.
</P>
<P>
Marchi said the figure should be even lower as none of the 
facilities will have to build a new runway. The Airbus jet takes off 
from a shorter distance than its Boeing rival.
</P>
<P>
"There are things that need to be done, but for most of them 
it's not a disruptive change."
</P>
<P>
Many airports will not even need new terminals, just to change 
existing buildings so passengers can board and disembark on two 
levels, said Marchi.
</P>
<P>
Dan Cohen-Nir, a Washington-based technical official for Airbus 
North America, said one of the key strengths of the A380 was that it 
had been conceived to be used in airports that already take the 
Boeing 747, with the minimum of extra works.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta, one of the busiest airports in the world, has refused 
to make changes to accommodate the A380 saying that no airline using 
the Georgia hub had indicated it wanted to bring the new jet there. 
But Cohen-Nir said this was not important as most of its traffic is 
domestic.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus official said he had not seen any sign that the US 
authorities were throwing up barriers to the A380, even though its 
development is becoming a major transatlantic dispute.

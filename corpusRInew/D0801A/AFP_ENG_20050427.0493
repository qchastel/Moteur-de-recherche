<P>
An association of residents 
living near Paris's Charles-de-Gaulle airport on Wednesday denounced 
the noise pollution generated by the giant Airbus A380, after the 
new airliner's maiden flight.
</P>
<P>
French acoustics expert Joel Ravenel, a member of the Advocnar 
group representing those who live near Charles de Gaulle, told AFP 
he had recorded a maximum sound level of 88 decibels just after the 
aircraft took off from near the southwestern city of Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
The figure makes the world's largest commercial jet "one of the 
loudest planes that will for decades fly over the heads of the four 
million people living in the area" outside Paris, Advocnar said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
Ravenel said sound levels near Charles de Gaulle airport 
normally reached about 40 decibels.
</P>
<P>
Journalists watching the Airbus A380's first flight at Toulouse 
airport in southwestern France, however, noted how quiet the 
take-off and landing had seemed.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of spectators cheered as the A380 touched down 
at the airport near Toulouse, home of the European aircraft maker 
Airbus Industrie, after a test flight of three hours and 54 
minutes.

Top Canadian drug tester attacks Armstrong drug 'expose'

<TEXT>
<P>
Claims by a French newspaper that 
seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong had taken EPO were 
attacked as unsound and unethical by the director of the Canadian 
laboratory whose tests saw Olympic drug cheat Ben Johnson hit with a 
lifetime ban.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe on Tuesday carried a front page story headlined 
"Armstrong's Lie" suggesting the Texan had used the illegal blood 
booster EPO (erythropoeitin) during his first Tour win in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The sports daily based its accusation on tests carried out by a 
French laboratory on frozen urine samples taken during the race six 
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong issued an immediate denial and on Wednesday L'Equipe's 
story came under fire from Christiane Ayotte, a director at Canada's 
National Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
"The stablity of EPO in urine isn't as long as five years 
according to our testing here in Montreal. It's more a matter of 
months," stressed Ayotte, whose testing centre is accredited to 
WADA, the world's anti-doping agency.
</P>
<P>
Ayotte though was quick not to cast doubts on the testing 
procedures of the French laboratory cited in the L'Equipe report.
</P>
<P>
"If the lab in Paris claims to have identified categorically the 
presence of erythropoetin in this urine then I have no doubt that 
the identification's adequate."
</P>
<P>
But she believes the paper's use of this as evidence is 
unethical.
</P>
<P>
"It's here that I question the context of the research. Testing 
must be carried out on true anonymous samples in a way that you 
can't link the athlete to the findings."
</P>
<P>
In such a case she argued you had to have the possibility of 
carrying out a second B Sample test to verify the result.
</P>
<P>
"The tracibility has to have been maintained throughout the five 
years...so that there's no ambiguity which is being made between the 
result, the sample, and the identity of the athlete."
</P>
<P>
Ayotte suggested this hadn't been the case with the findings 
used by L'Equipe to back up their story.
</P>
<P>
"This has been carried out in a context of research which means 
that there hasn't been the strictiness that one finds in keeping 
papers to create a file when there's a positive result."
</P>
<P>
She said she was "astonished" that the laboratory had allowed 
the newspaper to put a name to the samples and that it had confirmed 
the presence of EPO in them.
</P>
<P>
"That's just not done," she claimed.
</P>
<P>
"Do you think athletes are going to give their agreement to 
research if similar things like this happen?
</P>
<P>
"There's evidently been some wrongdoing here but we have to be 
sure we're pointing the finger at the guilty person and that it's 
done in the proper way."

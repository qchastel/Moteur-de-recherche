<P>
Seven-time Tour de France winner 
Lance Armstrong was given major support in his fight against doping 
allegations on Friday by the International Cycling Union (UCI) and a 
Texas legal triumph. 
</P>
<P>
Capping a week that included his engagement to rock singer 
Sheryl Crow and hints at a possible 2006 return from retirement, 
Armstrong had his denials of taking performance-enhancing drugs 
strongly bolstered in separate findings. 
</P>
<P>
A UCI statement said no action would be taken against Armstrong 
over claims by the French sports daily L'Equipe that his 1999 urine 
samples tested positive for the banned blood booster EPO 
(erythropoietin).
</P>
<P>
Cycling's world governing body found nothing that could be used 
as proof of wrongdoing by Armstrong and no reason to condemn him, 
wondering instead who leaked Armstrong's identity and why his sample 
was chosen for testing. 
</P>
<P>
"Im pleased the UCI is investigating this entire matter 
thoroughly because any professional investigation will reveal that 
the allegations made by a French sports tabloid have no basis 
because I never used any performance enhancing drugs," Armstrong 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Im pleased that the UCI seems to be asking many of the right 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who turns 34 on September 18, also won a summary 
judgement in a Texas court case that dismissed charges Armstrong 
defrauded and breached a contract with his former personal 
assistant, Mike Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
The legal fight included Anderson claims that he found items in 
a Spanish apartment linking Armstrong to banned substances and that 
Armstrong avoided a 2004 random doping test. 
</P>
<P>
"This totally vindicates Lance's position. He's pleased," said 
Bill Stapleton, a lawyer for Armstrong. "Today vindicates Lance and 
points out that the accusations he made against Lance were without 
merit in an American court.
</P>
<P>
"The Anderson ruling is very significant in that he has been 
someone who has been given credibility in newspapers in France like 
Le Monde and L'Equipe."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong's engagement to Crow was announced Monday, a day 
before the US cycling legend stated that he might seek an eighth 
consecutive Tour victory next July as a result of the latest 
accusations.
</P>
<P>
"The recent smear campaign out of France has awoken my 
competitive side," Armstrong said. "I'm not willing to put a 
percentage on the chances but I will no longer rule it out."

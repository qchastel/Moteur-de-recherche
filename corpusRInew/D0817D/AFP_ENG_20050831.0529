Armstrong's exploits not just down to EPO claims expert

BERLIN, Aug 31

The exploits of seven-times Tour de 
France champion Lance Armstrong, who is alleged to have used the 
banned blood booster EPO (erythropoietin) in 1999, are also down to 
the use of other banned substances according to one expert.
</P>
<P>
Alessandro Donati, a specialist in the fight against doping in 
sport, suggested the performances of the 33-year-old American appear 
to show he has used a range of banned substances, including anabolic 
steroids.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who retired after his seventh yellow jersey victory 
last month,   has always denied ever taking banned substances, and 
has been on a major defensive since a report by French newspaper 
L'Equipe last week showed details of doping test results from the 
Tour de France in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The paper alleged Armstrong had tested positive six times for 
EPO in that year's race. At the time the test for EPO did not exist 
and testing on the samples from 1999 only began in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Donati said he was not at all surprised to read the damaging 
report about Armstrong and even claimed the now-retired American is 
just one of hundreds of professional cyclists who are dealing with 
danger.
</P>
<P>
"During the past few years there have been clear indications as 
to how Armstrong has been so successful," Donati, who was formerly 
in charge of the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) research centre, 
told German weekly Die Zeit to appear Thursday.
</P>
<P>
EPO, a naturally-occurring hormone which is also synthetically 
produced, has been the scourge of endurance sports for over 15 years 
due to its capacity to increase the volume of oxygen-rich red blood 
cells in the blood.
</P>
<P>
He added: "No one could achieve what Armstrong has achieved 
taking EPO on its own. EPO improves your breathing capacity. But you 
also need other substances, such as anabolics, testosterone and a 
lot of others.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of riders take whatever they can get their hands on, I 
mean everything, to go faster than the next guy."
</P>
<P>
Donati, who has a background specialising in athletics, became 
known in the anti-doping world in 1994 for creating a file on the 
top level athletes and their doctors - in particular in the world of 
cycling - who had been caught up in doping affairs.
</P>
<P>
He added: "Cycling is still a victim of widespread doping. It is 
caught in the jaws of doping because tactics in cycling plays a very 
minor role. What you need absolutely most of all is sheer physical 
strength."
</P>
<P>
Donati however criticised L'Equipe newspaper for its moralistic 
stance towards the American. L'Equipe is owned by Amaury Sports 
Organisation, which is also the mother company which runs the Tour 
de France.
</P>
<P>
"The documents printed by L'Equipe are very damaging but also 
unquestionable. But the paper's own position is much less clear," 
said Donati.
</P>
<P>
"Newspapers who report on cycling shouldn't be organising races, 
especially the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
"It the same with the Tour of Italy, which is practically run by 
the Gazzetta dello Sport (newspaper)."

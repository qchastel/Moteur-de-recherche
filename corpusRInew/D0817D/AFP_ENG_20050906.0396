<P>
Seven-time Tour de France winner 
Lance Armstrong is considering coming out of retirement in a bid to 
take revenge on the hosts of the world's biggest race following a 
spate of doping accusations, an Austin, Texas newspaper reported 
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking about it," the Austin American-Statesman quoted 
Armstrong as saying. "I'm thinking it's the best way to piss (the 
French) off."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong told the newspaper he had been thinking about a 
comeback for only the past two weeks, since French sports daily 
L'Equipe reported on August 23 that urine samples taken from 
Armstrong in 1999 during his first Tour triumph tested positive for 
the banned substance EPO.
</P>
<P>
Asked how serious he was about another Tour, Armstrong replied: 
"I'm exercising every day."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong retired in July after winning his seventh straight 
Tour de France but expectations of relaxing holidays with his three 
kids and his new fiancee, rock star Sheryl Crow, have been tempered 
by a spate of doping allegations.
</P>
<P>
The Texan has vehemently denied taking any performance-enhancing 
drugs however a number of experts and former employees have come out 
of the woodwork to denounce the Texan champion.
</P>
<P>
Johan Bruyneel, the 33-year-old Armstrong's team manager at 
Discovery Channel, admitted that nothing concrete had been decided 
but the door was still open for a return.
</P>
<P>
"We could decide during our training camp in December (in the 
United States), which will be decisive (for the Tour)," Bruyneel 
told the Belgian news agency Belga.
</P>
<P>
"But don't make me say that Lance has already decided what he 
will do with the rest of his career. That said, we speak for 15 
minutes on the phone every day, and for 13 of those we talk about 
cycling."
</P>
<P>
Bruyneel, who has orchestrated Armstrong's career since the 
American returned to cycling after his successful recovery from 
cancer in 1998, suggested Armstrong simply missed racing.
</P>
<P>
"He (Armstrong) got back on the bike to train three weeks after 
the end of the Tour de France. He follows the team's progress 
closely and it's sure that he's still hungry for success.
</P>
<P>
"He's missing racing, and everything that goes with it. That's 
normal. Maybe he's thinking about taking some kind of sporting 
revenge for the allegations of doping that he's had to hear day 
after day.
</P>
<P>
"He could be feeling the need to prove to everyone that he is 
the strongest, and that it's not down to illegal substances.
</P>
<P>
"There will always be a place on the team for him, if he decides 
to come back. Anyway, he's still under contract with us till the end 
of 2006."

<P>
American cycling hero Lance 
Armstrong said Thursday he is content to stay retired and has no 
plans to go for an eighth straight Tour de France title.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong claims he spoke too soon when he said earlier this 
month that he was prepared to make a comeback just to spite French 
organizers of the world's most challenging bike race.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy with the way my career went and I am happy with the 
way it ended. I am not coming back," Armstrong said. "There is no 
way I can go back there (France). I would be crazy, so why don't we 
all just say I am not going back." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who retired after his seventh consecutive Tour de 
France victory in July, has been accused of using banned blood 
booster EPO (erythropoietin) by French sports daily L'Equipe in an 
article which showed details of 1999 drugs tests.
</P>
<P>
Once again Armstrong vehemently denied the allegations on 
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to say this in just a few words. I have nothing to 
hide," Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Armstrong believes there are too many people who 
are against him in France to make it possible for him to go back and 
ride.
</P>
<P>
"I opened it up a few weeks ago by saying I might come back," 
Armstrong said. "But today I am dealing with all this again.
</P>
<P>
"I know if I go back there is no way I am going to get a fair 
shake in the lab, on the roadside, in the hotel, in my food. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sick of dealing with this (expletive). I got three kids in 
the pool right now and they are screaming my name."
</P>
<P>
On August 23, L'Equipe reported with a front page headline "The 
Armstrong Lie" that six of Armstrong's urine samples tested positive 
for EPO during the 1999 race.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe reported that positive results came solely from B 
samples, the second of two samples used in doping tests.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said Thursday the integrity of the international 
anti-doping system is at stake because of the way the samples were 
mis-handled and the manner in which the information passed on to the 
newspaper. He also isn't ruling out sabotage.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in standing up for what is right," Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
These were not the first allegations of drug use against 
Armstrong since his recovery from testicular cancer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A 2004 book by former L'Equipe journalist Pierre Ballester 
entitled "LA Confidential: The Secrets of Lance Armstrong," cited 
one of the cyclist's former assistants claiming Armstrong once asked 
her to dispose of used syringes.
</P>
<P>
Until 2001, cycling's international governing body did not use a 
urine test for EPO, which builds endurance by boosting the 
oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.

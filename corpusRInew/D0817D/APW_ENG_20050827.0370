French fans directed harsh words at the newspaper that accused seven-time Tour
de France winner Lance Armstrong of doping, saying the report has no bearing on
their respect for the American cyclist.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe published a series of letters-to-the-editor in its weekend magazine
Saturday in response to last week's cover story that Armstrong used a banned
blood booster in his first Tour win in 1999. The cyclist has denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven letters published, six voiced support for Armstrong and varying
degrees of anger at the newspaper for what they called pointless
muckraking.
</P>
<P>
"Leave him alone!" wrote Eugenie Hays from the Brittany town of La
Forest-Landerneau. Like many readers, she noted that so many athletes take
banned products these days but not everyone inspires like Armstrong. "Don't
shatter our dreams."
</P>
<P>
Louis Riche, another reader, wrote in to say that, "these accusations (true or
false having little importance) only show one thing: that scientific research is
seven years late."
</P>
<P>
He questioned whether French cyclists would face the same scrutiny as the
American star.
</P>
<P>
"So, in six years we'll know if Thomas Voeckler was doped on the 2004 Tour,"
Riche asked about the rider who held the yellow jersey for 10 stages that year.
"Ah, no, am I crazy? He's French."
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe reported Tuesday that new tests on six urine samples he provided during
the 1999 tour resulted in positive results for the red blood cell-booster
EPO.
</P>
<P>
William Dubois wrote to say he does a fair amount of cycling and understands the
need for an energy booster.
</P>
<P>
"For me, my EPO, from time to time is (licorice-flavored aperitif) pastis and,
at Sunday dinner, a good glass of wine! I know that professionals don't only
drink mineral water," he said.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone spared Armstrong from judgment.
</P>
<P>
"You were my hero," wrote Rahila Abdul. "Why did you do it?"
